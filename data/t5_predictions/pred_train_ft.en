28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who just moved to San Francisco was found dead this week at a local shopping mall.
But the victim's brother said he couldn't imagine who would want to harm him, saying "everything was finally fine."
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found in West End shopping mall on Wednesday morning was confirmed as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department said the case was found to have been killed and is under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the broadcaster's San Francisco radio station KGO that Frank, who had previously been a plumber cook in Boston, found an ideal job for a plumber chef at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
The spokesman said: "We are a small team of close-knit families and we will miss him deeply."
In this sad moment, we express our deep sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia called Frank in the reception at first, but recently "everything finally got better."
Louis Galicia told KGO: "Frank found an apartment while dealing with a girl."
Louis Galicia says he can't imagine who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a good heart and wide throat.
Louis Galicia said: "Frank often cooks dinner for his family."
He never wanted to quarrel with his family.
He is a person who listens to everyone's opinions.
Louis Galicia said: "Everything in the world is likely to go wrong, but Frank deserves to be a day-to-day rough showman."
Call the San Francisco Police Department to report 415-575-4444.
Primary Doctors Strike: Call for New Labour Action
The Deputy Doctors' Representative called on the Alliance to approve new labour action against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's Committee of Primary Physicians will ask all its members to start supporting more labour action in early September.
The Committee of Junior Physicians said the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted in July to boycott contract deals with the British Medical Association.
Fifty-eight percent of the members who participated in the voting objected to the contract transaction.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Physicians' Committee, said in a letter to members on Twitter Thursday night that the government "has always kept silent" over issues leading to contract boycotts.
She said: "In view of this, the Executive Committee of the Commission on Junior Physicians has voted completely against the proposed new contract and called for a re-opening of formal consultations on all concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the Commission on Junior Doctors today formally requested the Council of the British Medical Association to convene a special session to approve a long-term plan aimed at revamping labour action from early September.
The dispute has led to the participation of primary doctors in six strikes this year, including the first comprehensive strike in the history of the UK's national healthcare system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the primary doctor's leader at the British Medical Association, resigned after a vote to resist the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the British Medical Association.
In a meeting prior to the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforceable among health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Involvement in the Union"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met on Tuesday, shaking hands and announcing the formal end of an eight-month long sanitary war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in a magnificent hall of St. Petersburg palace, I had a strong feeling: this reconciliation was Ankara's best to see.
Yes, both sides did shake hands.
However, even according to Mr. Putin's long-held standards, he was just a shallow smile and hardly showed enthusiasm.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reportedly mentioned Putin's "good friends" five times.
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to pre-crisis levels and even reach higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper wrote that Mr. Erdogan was acting as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm hinted at something contrary.
However, Mr. Putin's continued chilly attitude shows that he hasn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction was fierce at the time.
Mr. Putin lashed out at the incident, accusing Ankara of counting Moscow behind him.
Attacks from so-called friends are even more difficult to accept.
It is difficult or even impossible for both sides to re-establish genuine confidence.
Since November, the Russian publicity has also reversed.
For months, government-controlled media have carried out a shocking total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
The most serious of these are accusations from senior officials: Mr. Erdogan's family has profited from illegal oil deals in the so-called Islamic State-controlled Syrian area.
He categorically denied that claim.
However, the news from St. Petersburg shows that it's time to look forward.
After all, the meeting was premised on Putin's apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are obvious.
First, Erdogan was almost ousted after a failed coup last month, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have clearly inflicted a great blow on him.
There are also economic motivations.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly by banning chartering services that can transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has plummeted by nearly 90%.
As the flight recovers, Russian travel agencies and chartering companies will be relieved.
They will be ushering in a season-end Mediterranean tourist boom.
National television even forecasts this week that as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are reopened, prices for fruits and vegetables will fall.
A report from the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti reads: "Tourists have gone, tomatoes are back."
For Moscow, the visit also has extra political value.
Ankara is furious about the weak reaction of the Western world to taking over intentions.
In addition, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow progress of accession negotiations and Putin's intrusion, who is keen to exploit political chills and weaken relations between Turkey and the Western world.
As Russia champions elected authorities after a failed coup, the Russian leader is bound to get an extra penny from Ankara.
Note that this is a gift for Moscow, which has been deeply fearful of regime change.
So the meeting held in this brilliant seaside palace has made Russia and Turkey allies of two Western-rejected countries with abuse, an analyst describing it as a "compassionate alliance."
However, despite the open reconciliation, there are still major divergences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors. Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have supported the opposite factions.
It is foreseeable that after nearly three hours of initial conversation, the two presidents said at the press conference they had not yet discussed the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately evaded questions about the differences between the two sides, and Putin emphasized it.
The two sides have not reached a clear consensus on how to achieve reciprocity on the Syrian issue.
With the possibility of months of open hostilities and major calamities brought about by Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in which Russia's warplanes have been shot down, restarting dialogue between the two leaders is certainly good.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank will be streamlined into a logistics department.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McJuan told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand has been committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago it was nearing collapse, and having to receive the aid from that time began to give up such a pursuit.
During that time, brand strategists used the "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events such as Rugby Six Nations and Winmbledon Tennis Championship champion Andy Murray.
But now, the right thing is to get more national brands out there.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not reply as it is.
In England and Wales, all references outside of headquarters and stock exchanges will be changed to the National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used for clients of the Republic of Ireland and the Autonomous Region of Northern Ireland.
There are other more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Cuisbank, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McYun has interviewed clients and employees in Infernes County on a tour.
He told the BBC Scotland division that "Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our investor brand and also one of employees' hired brands, as we are now more in a sense a bank with many brands."
As the bank itself becomes an international brand, RBS is also a global brand.
At the moment, what I'm saying is that we no longer focus on the world and have turned our eyes to locality.
Each brand represents different industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has shown that it will not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships; at the same time, efforts have been made to enhance the image of different brands sponsored in sports events.
The CEO said: "It's time to become a multi-brand bank, because in private we have been exploring how to be a better customer service bank."
If three years ago we wanted to become a big bank with many brands, it would be ridiculed.
We are currently focusing on customer needs and I am confident that you have noticed these changes.
I think we can relaunch these brands, and the time is right now.
Deuteronomy wins 3,000 career victories with Predilection in New maquito
Newmakit's two victories helped Deuteronomy win a career of 3,000 after he sprayed Champagne to celebrate.
On Friday, professional racetracker Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory at Newmarket.
Predilection, with the hands of an accomplished horseman John Gosden, rushed on the road to win two victories that night and achieved a career of 3,000.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional horse racer to achieve this milestone in the field of square races.
The top five are: Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion rider who had previously won in Ghayyar said, "This is very special."
I'm thrilled because my family is also on the scene.
I am delighted with my accomplishments in Newmakit, as I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a large-scale horse race or Royal Ascot, which is just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 spectators.
I am very gratified and humble.
Deuteronomy took Predilection after winning, sparking a full-fledged cheer.
In the field of obstacles, two riders achieved this achievement, respectively, champion rider Richard Johnson and now retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with Sir McCoy winning more than 4,300 victories in his record career.
Berger was the nine-time German champion and had a total of 4,493 victories in his career.
Dei Turley is one of the best cyclists of our time, so it's no surprise that he has achieved this milestone and there are few people who have made it before him.
He is fashionable, but what really makes him stand out in the weighing room is his tactical rationale.
He's an amazing horse-drawn ambassador and for years his passion and charm have attracted a lot of fans to the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Die Tuley in Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend cyclist with the racer, he should have been able to win 6,000!
Really, it's too important that Dee Tuley is the best horse race winner in 30 years in England.
He's characterful and good for the British horse race, but besides that he's also an incredible rider.
Deuteronomy celebrates this milestone with its iconic jumpdown action.
From jumping tide to jumping down the horse, for two decades, Deuteronomy has been a typical representative of England's field of tennis.
His career was like a roller coaster.
He won several competitions, including the famous "Seven wins" of the 1996 Royal Esco horse race, but he also suffered a crash and was banned for taking drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned to the game after the six-month ban period, he was once very arduous. But he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally came back to the top for those who were skeptical.
He may not have been able to do it for too long - Dee Tuley has said before that he wants to be at least 50-year-old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin Removes Director of the Office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
For many years, Mr. Ivanov has been a part of the core group that is deeply trusted by Mr. Putin.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had "declared the dismissal of Ivanov as Director of the Russian Presidential Office," but did not give a reason.
Anton Vaino, who started as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, now 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), working at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the draft president and government employees of the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After his appointment, he said to Mr. Putin: "Thanks for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of our Government is to support the drafting of laws and control directives by heads of State.
Mr. Putin told Russian television on Friday that Mr. Ivanov himself asked for resignation and recommended Mr. Vaino to take over himself.
Is that smile convincing?
Moscow is uneasy about this.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Putin's closest aides and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As director of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was aired on state television, both said the office director himself had asked for resignation.
Despite the full smile in front of the camera, almost no one is convinced - especially at this time before the parliamentary elections.
So, is this the result of a defeat in some kind of power struggle?
There is no information yet.
However, the official claim - a person who was once seen as a presidential candidate suddenly chose to take over Russia's environmental policy - raises many doubts.
The Kremlin website cites Mr. Ivanov's conversation with Mr. Putin, who said: "Yes, in early 2012 I asked you to give me this hard-won job and maybe even a troubled job for four years."
"As a result, I've been the head of the presidential office for four or eight months."
Mr. Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr. Putin, an ex-member of the National Security Agency.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin became director of the Federal Security Agency (FSB), he was formerly the National Security Agency, Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr. Putin took office, he also designated Mr. Ivanov as one of his five most trusted men.
The outside world once thought that Mr. Ivanov might be the Russian president after Mr. Putin's second term, because three re-elections were inconsistent with the Constitution.
But the position eventually belonged to another close aide to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before re-serving the presidency three and a half years later, Mr. Putin took office as Prime Minister of Russia.
Mystery Fish Explored Banff A Garden
A resident of Banff found fish stunned in his garden and then asked for help.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may have been scraped by sea tornadoes.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of this strange scene on Periscope hoping someone could explain why these two-inch long fish appeared.
The Kunsferry Bridge is now accessible to Fauf
The PS1.35 billion project plan was completed in May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern side of the Queensferry Crossing bridge and the high-rise bridge, which means that the bridge is now accessible to Fauf.
The "bridge-face wind turbine" located near the three bridgeheads of each bridge is now close to completion, and the project is the first bridge.
The bridge, which began in Faffa, is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 ramps.
The PS1.35 billion project plan was completed in May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and became one of the first people to climb the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Kunsferry Bridge."
We are all witnessing engineering work on such a grand project, and this section of the bridge alone uses more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel.
Although the size and weight of the bridge is huge, it takes fine work to complete the chords between the high-rise bridge and the bridge surface, and requires very precise assembly.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge surface is now installed and the last concrete bridge surface is poured in Rosyth today, which means that all bridges are ready to take place.
Michael Martin, Project Director of the Kunsferry Bridge Construction Company, said: "No matter which bridge project, the first horon is a major milestone."
In terms of the great project, this hulong demonstrates the cutting-edge civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded Northern Bridge Road Panel, the remaining gaps on either the north or near the land side will need to be completed.
To complete this operation, it is necessary to move 700 mm south of the northern high-rise bridge.
It's a huge job, and it's also a very meticulous job.
It's huge because the bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons.
It's accurate because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, with only a few millimeters on each side.
It is gratifying to note that everything has progressed well.
Simon Byers wins female Gymnastics All-Powerful Championship
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is not affected by this.
Vibranty when jumping horses.
There is no balance between the woods on the upstream edge.
Free gymnastics are amazing.
The overall performance is wonderful.
Now, he finally became the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won an all-powerful title Thursday, fully demonstrating her talent for leading the world in gymnastics.
She scored a total of 62.198 well above silver medalist, Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simon Bayers, from the United States, performed a balanced wooden performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics Artistic Gymnastics Women's Personal Almighty Final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayers helped the U.S. team achieve four consecutive championships in Olympic women's gymnastics personal allegiance, she personally won five medals at the Olympics, further confirming that she is this generation, or perhaps the best Gymnastics team member ever.
When she saw her total score, Bailes couldn't help shed tears. She finally ended this long journey.
As a result, Bayers is among the "distinguished athletes for decades" like Michael Phelps, bringing sports projects to new heights in their respective fields:
For the last three years, Bayers has been a hegemonic player and won 15 world championship medals, including ten gold medals. She is passionately trained daily to achieve higher precision. The 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said: "Bayers are the best gymnast I've ever seen."
There's also the last game in Brazil, but this match is more than a rivalry between Bayers and other gymnasts than her own competition with huge expectations pressure.
If Bayers doesn't have a full gold card back to her home in Spring, Texas, everyone will be very disappointed.
Simon Byers (left) from the United States hugged each other with Lesman, who won gold and silver medals at the Artistic Gymnastics Women's Personal All-Power Final of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.
Bayers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise to the retiring national team coach Martha Karolyi.
Although Bayers insists that he hasn't planned the future in his reign as a champion, the fact is not entirely so.
A part of Bayers' free gymnasium - including her iconic spin-off series - is with Latin music, which she often hears in a single street away from the Rio Olympic venue.
This is not coincidental.
The girl, who was adopted by grandparents during her infancy and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother on a field trip to the gymnasium, has now grown into strength.
Since the summer of 2013, Bailes hasn't lost his hand in an all-powerful game, and she will win as long as she wants to win.
Just a little bit ahead of Mustafa's two spins after it was just an illusion.
The two projects of balancing wood and free gymnastics, the defending world champion Byers, are waiting.
She scored 15.433 for balancing wood and 15.933 for free gymnastics.
When he waited for the final score, Lesman gently held Bailes. When Bailes learned that he had achieved what he wanted, tears were left.
Lesman's performance was somewhat like a vengeance four years ago, when she was third but lost to Mustavenna in the final win.
This time, the 22-year-old captain, dubbed "Grandma," was far ahead.
She flew kissing the crowd after the free gymnasium, announcing a return, but such a return sometimes seemed to be questionable before.
Baiers is only 19 years old. Since the beginning of this week, his message has been virally spread on Twitter. In Bayers' case, his life has been given a new meaning.
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was "numbered in the body," survived a Philadelphia shooting.
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old child in the city this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the shooter was Mahaj Brown.
They said there were multiple gunshot wounds in Brown's abdomen, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was sober on his way to medical care.
"He was slain with a lot of sins, and the small body was sorely hit by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told television.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in jeopardy at the hospital and had undergone several surgeries.
His family told television that the child is expected to recover.
He was going to start his first year at a local primary school.
Brown is one of four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Of the three others shot, two were 29 years old and one was 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims is in critical condition; the other two are stable.
Television said the child and the 29-year-old's critical victim were found on the front seat of the car.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether there were gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it looked like multiple gunmen crossfire.
The shell shells of a number of attacking weapons were found on the scene, thereby inferring that they used different offensive weapons.
As a result, this is no doubt an ongoing war.
There are shells on both sides of the street.
"So, it's possible that there were multiple armed men on the scene at the time in a state of agitation," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told television.
Many homes and vehicles were damaged in the area.
The arrests have not yet been carried out, and it is said that the police are looking at surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old child (girl) was shot in the arm while playing at the door of the West Oak Lane community.
She is currently recovering and police are still chasing the suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie?
This is why I'm evaluating this year's women's gymnastics team for more than one reason.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never had such a hegemony.
Second, the gymnasium team has three excellent gymnasts - Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez - who have been inspiring many girls of color.
The team's composition is proud of everyone because it includes Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
This team finally looks like an American team.
It also cemented the primacy of black and Latino women in this movement.
For the last four years, the top female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel were ranked first and second.
It's so great.
At the last Olympics, Gabriel Douglas "unexpectedly" became the Olympic champion, which hailed the United States.
Today, the world is witnessing three-time world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez's remarkable performance. They deduced conventional gymnastics techniques into Godhood.
On Thursday, Simon helped the U.S. team achieve four championships on the women's personal omnipotent project.
Her teammate Ali Lesman scored a silver medal.
We climbed to the top of this sport, but it wasn't so in all American gymnastics classrooms.
Simon, Gabriel and Laurie are on the same path as Ali and Madison.
They are the Final Five because the next Olympic Gymnastics team will consist of four gymnasts, which is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.
But the reality is that Gymnastics is a costly sport, where gymnasts are trained primarily in private gymnastics clubs and their parents have to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, games and hotel expenses (including coaches and gymnasts and family costs), and the list of fees continues to grow.
Most gymnastics clubs are located in a wealthy suburb that can support the industry.
All training for gymnasts is done at these clubs, and it's a long-term cost to the gymnast family.
Bayers' coach Aimee Boorman and Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have been teaching them since the two gymnasts began practicing gymnastics.
We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to countless young girls who are deeply influenced by Simon, Gabriel and Laurie.
Twenty years ago, I founded my own gymnastics foundation.
In my organization, we offer free and inexpensive gymnastics to more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Hispanic) in the Negro residential areas and develop national and world champions.
In September, we'll expand to Terrio (my hometown), offering high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and will benefit from this remarkable Olympic movement.
Gymnastics helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the spirit, self-discipline and determination of suffering.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, academic and job success.
Encouraged by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in the sport is significant, especially for girls.
It's an exciting moment.
Thank you to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabriel and Madison for their "girls' strength" in winning Olympic gold medals as well as inspiring so many young girls with diverse backgrounds to open the road to health, strength and success.
After dismissing Jeremy Hunt's proposal, junior doctors plan to launch further strikes
The ministers initially wanted to end the change-induced dispute through a modified contract with British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 primary doctors who participated in the vote objected to the contract.
In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract, saying that the UK's National Medical Service System (NHS) is currently in a "vacuum zone" where slight delays could harm employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions the modification of primary doctors' working practices throughout the night and weekend to improve care for non-regular working hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors' Committee, said in a statement: "Primary doctors remain gravely concerned about the proposed contract, particularly that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and fail to treat all physicians fairly."
Just eight weeks from the first doctors to sign a new contract, and we need to make progress.
The BMA strives to resolve disputes through negotiations, but people are reluctant to participate and sometimes the government responds silently.
Still, just last month we got the promise of Jeremy Hunt, who said his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to eliminate enforcement and address the concerns of junior doctors."
If he doesn't do this, the junior doctors have made it clear that they are ready for further labor action.
The last strike, which took place at the end of April, resulted in nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointment delays as nurses and consultancies masked doctors on picket lines.
The ministers initially wanted to end the change-induced dispute by accepting a modified BMA contract.
BMA wants to earn better weekend pay for the 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
NHS Employers CEO Daniel Mortimer called for junior doctors to stop any more strikes.
Mr. Mortimer said: "Labour operations are irrelevant, but they put pressure on teams and services that have already poured their fullest effort into the cause of concern, anxiety and confusion among patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have continued to negotiate with the Committee on Junior Physicians and actively respond to their concerns about guardianship roles and whistleblowers along with the Ministry of Health and other departments.
Employers want to continue to actively explore other important topics - such as deployment, training flexibility, other training for those who recruit after a career break, training costs, common understanding of the curriculum, continuing leave and gender pay gaps in medical care - which illustrate the importance employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health attach to the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds a day of drugs can reduce the threat of heart attack
Relevant officials suggested extending a PS2-per-day drug to more patients and prolonging the duration of medication, after which thousands of people with heart disease would benefit from it.
Anti-coagrelor ticagrelor can reduce the risk of heart attack in patients with heart disease.
The drug lasts for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), a regulatory body under the UK's National Healthcare System (NHS), recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
But now, NICE, the NHS regulator, recommends that patients continue to receive medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from heart disease every year, and one in four will continue to experience a heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances depositing plaques in the arteries.
If the plaque is broken, it can lead to blood clots, thereby preventing blood flow into the heart and causing a heart attack.
If the blood clots move, it enters the bloodstream, preventing blood flow into the brain and causing stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack are at higher risk of reoccurring.
It was manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and sold as a commodity name in Brilique, which reduces the risk of clots by reducing their formation.
The draft NICE guidelines released today recommend that patients take 90 mg of tekagre for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of tekagre and two aspirin per day in the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of patients who have had a history of heart attack will relapse or stroke, usually with severe consequences."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on the quality of one's life.
Evidence suggests that taking Cagre with aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of heart relapse and stroke in patients who have had a heart attack.
We are deeply appreciative of the interim recommendation for Kagre, which will provide more treatment options to thousands of beneficiaries.
Because there is limited information about the efficacy and safety of tikagra three years later, in particular the risk of hemorrhage, the draft guidance does not recommend that it continue to be treated after this period.
Computer culture makes "election fraud" prevalent in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets' ex-mayor, Lutfur Rahman, was fired last year on corruption and prompted a government report to be published.
The culture of "political correctness" has blinded the popular electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report that reveals today.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles accused police, electoral regulators and city councils of blinding evidence of misuse of elections for "excessive sensitivity to racial profiling and religious issues."
The former Minister of Community Affairs and the current anti-corruption hand said that the practice of intimidating voters with religious stances was deplorable, and police should be allowed to establish a wake-up line outside the polling station so as to protect feared voters.
He suggested that voters should carry identification documents when voting in order to validate their identity.
At the moment, voters only need to report their name and address.
The report even recommends that ink not wiped out on voters' fingers prevent a second vote.
Sir Eric said that the protection of whistleblowers should be increased.
He called for an increase in the media &apos; s understanding of conference documents and decisions taken by non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not just to guard against electoral fraud, it's also to protect local governments from a broad culture of corruption and the toxic effects of financial scams that are closely associated with them," he said.
The report was issued after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London, which Downing Street demanded.
Last year, a special election tribunal ruled that there was a string of corruption and illegalities in the position of Mayor Rakhman who should be dismissed.
The court found that Rakhman "very ridiculously abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community and closed his mouth to allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
Rakhman is said to have "proclaimed that his vote was a religious obligation for faithful Muslims during the campaign."
As many as 300 ballots are doubtful, perhaps the voters faked other people's votes.
Sir Eric said there is evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He particularly cautioned against mailing election fraud, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to exert pressure on voters to force those voters to vote for their designated candidates.
Sir Eric (in the photo) has made a number of recommendations on clearing voting mechanisms, including taking identification documents to confirm his identity.
"The evidence shows that senior members, especially those in background communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, exert pressure on vulnerable groups of some minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote as they wish."
"Because of their excessive sensitivity to racial division and religious 'political correctness', they fear that State institutions will be blinded by such behavior."
Sir Eric has proposed 50 proposals for clearing the election mechanism, including a strict ban on political activists to process mailing voting documents to stop "voting harvests."
The report also requires strict registration information to prevent the voter roster from being used for immigration and welfare fraud. Theresa May is also considering the report.
These recommendations include requiring voters to present identity papers before voting.
After the vote, polishing ink on voters' fingers prevents anyone from voting twice.
Systematic verification of the ethnicity of voters to ensure voting qualifications.
The duration of the request for an automated mailing vote is set at three years.
Political activists and militants are prohibited from processing completed postal ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Police are authorized to set a wake-up line around the polling station.
Amendments to the provisions of the law make it easier to charge persons for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to make photoshoots at the polling station.
Provision is made that only English can be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Enhancing training and ensuring that staff are strictly implementing the provisions of "electors alone in the voting hall".
Sir Eric denounced the Metropolitan Police, saying they hadn't filed any criminal charges since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"Lakhman and his election officers have had a number of corruption and illegalities, so they were disqualified by the Electoral Tribunal," he said.
According to the standards of criminal proof, he is in many respects unquestionably guilty.
He also criticised the election registration department of the City Hall as a false "check box".
Sir Eric said: "Last year the court heard a wake-up call to Tower Hamlets' verdict."
Our country has a glorious tradition of "mother of parliament", but the privately smeared electoral fraud by certain institutions and its aftermath are all very disturbing and threaten this good reputation.
Rio Olympics look like Kate's cyclists and other celebrities have been revered
This week, Pauline Ferrand Prevot, a French biker who looks like Princess Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, was greatly admired by spectators.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn't the only gold medal contender at this Summer Olympics, at least not so in social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities that appeared on screen at the time, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympians who hit Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio from a young age
In addition to hitting Kate's face on the bike track, many netizens soon found that a shooter was just Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Ever since his pictorial portrayal of Wolf of Wall Street was revealed on Twitter, U.S. man-soldier Brady Ellison has sparked huge turmoil on social media.
In fact, the shooter caught social media hype and admitted that someone who hit a young boy said he looked like a little elbow.
"I don't think it looks pretty much like a bumblebee," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome hairdresser, so I think it's exaggerating to me."
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly find more similarities this year: British skipper Greg Rutherford looks like an exceptionally famous actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with a pair of talking eyes, was accused of looking like the Cuban-American star Gloria Estefan.
For many years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Replacement: The user believes Nathan Adrian is the "sport version" of the Inception Actor.
Another pair of old people were compared to tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose brows and lips looked very similar.
Silver Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalinne McCord have the same bronze skin and blond hair, while the U.S. team's Ni Cousin is compared to "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Girlfriend: Football star Hope Solo (left) and actor Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user is happy to find that others also see these similarities.
Dissemination theory: According to the user, this pair looks like maybe there's a reason.
One Twitter user recently cheerfully claimed online that "other netizens also believe that Hopp Soro and Jennifer Carpenter actually look the same."
Indeed, the American football star and the bloodthirsty forensic actor have very similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerri Walsh Jennings, whose smile almost resembles that of actress Laura Linney; and gold medaled gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and splendid smile is similar to that of Bring It On star Gabriel Union.
CBC Olympic lobbyist apologizes for comments by Chinese swimmers "as slow as pigs"
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments on the 14-year-old Admiral Yizheng to win fourth place at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay kicked off viewers who watched the CBC Olympic livestream.
A Canadian broadcaster's CBC spokesman said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would "float faster than the smell of fragrance" in the race, and finally "beas slow as a pig," after which the CBC was forced to apologize.
Explanator Byron MacDonald made some of his own remarks at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
The audience heard the CBC's declarant team, Bayron, a "colored glasses" commentator, said: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
It was too excited to start swimming faster than stinking, but later as slow as a pig.
Thanks to her.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Aijiang Siong, was the second player with a time of 1.57 seconds and 79 seconds - behind Canada's Taylor Ruck by 1.61 seconds, which then led the Canadian team to narrow the gap with China.
The entire Canadian audience was shocked by the tone and wording of the interpreter, after which they quickly reacted on the network.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "The CBC commentator said the Chinese 14-year-old swimmer was'slow like a pig'?"
This idiot didn't realize it was livestreaming.
China's 4x200 m freestyle relay finale is described as follows: "The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a stupid mistake."
Twitter's criticism of Byron MacDonald quickly hit the tweet, and many people asked him to withdraw from his explanation.
When Twitter users heard that Barron MacDonald reacted sluggishly, they didn't catch up with it.
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, Byron MacDonald."
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your actions make us all sound like a group of racists.
Shortly afterwards, CBC broadcaster Scott Russel apologised for Bayron's remarks in the livestream, saying: "We apologized for our comments on the performance of swimmers."
"We are sorry for this inappropriate wording."
CBC apologizes to Twitter users who responded to the statement more than 90 times
Another explanator Scott Russel also apologised for Byron.
CBC later pasted their apology copying to more than 90 other Twitter users who protested Bayron's explanation.
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are immensely sorry to say this and live it out.
Last night, we took swift action to apologize to the audience watching our livestream and paying attention to our viewers on social media.
It should be noted that Bayron's explanation is aimed at the performance of swimmers, but not specifically at her.
In other words, the wording is indeed inappropriate, and Bayron deeply regrets this.
McConnell apologised in the live broadcast on Thursday afternoon, saying his words didn't mean a half-point physical assault and trying to take it away from his speeches.
"I want to spend some time apologizing for what I said last night after the women's relay," he said at CBC.
"I'm just commenting on the performance of swimmers, not against them personally."
"Of course I don't mean disrespecting, I'm sorry."
Primark customers angered a woman who tried to wear underwear in the center of the store shamelessly
A woman stripped her underwear at a Primark store in the middle of the scene, and insiders didn't know where to look.
Worse, she also measured how she looked after wearing it and then took off her underwear and put it back to the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelf and eventually tested four underwear in the store at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
The woman continued to try underwear in this Primark store at Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, and then put it back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson (the mother of the two children) said that after trying to wear underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "Everyone can't believe what they see."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off a underwear from the shelf, removed her own pants and underwear, and then dressed like that.
"She didn't try to find a hidden place to try through - she just stood there, it was shameful."
"When she took off her underwear again, everyone was shocked and stunned. Evidently, she was still unhappy because she put the underwear back to the shelf."
After that, she tried three more like this, and finally found it wasn't her own favorite, then dressed again to get out of the store.
"She didn't seem to care if someone was looking at her - or did not think of who would eventually buy the underwear she tried to pass through."
Ms. Davidson, who lives in Kent town (33 years old), said: "It is nauseating to think someone will buy the underwear that others have crossed and are not washed."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "After she left, the shopkeeper obviously was going to take these underwear off-shelf treatment, fortunately."
"I hate buying a new underwear home, but I find another woman trying to get through and not being cleaned."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark already knows what happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9."
All of the goods in question have been scrapped.
How to Use Maggies to Protect Yourself in Gun Shooting Attacks
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you a sense of security.
We ask Rhon Mizrachi, Master of the Kraw Maga Federation in New York, how to deal with gunmen at close range.
Whether he's in front or behind you, the video will teach you how to win.
Mizrachi said that if the gunman approached you from behind, all you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "clear the fire line."
Then grab the gun with your forearm and shoulders, then hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
Next, with his knees over his abdominal trenches, when the attacker bends because of pain, reverses his gun in his hands, hits his face with a tube and reserve shotgun group, keeping weapons always aiming at him.
If the gunman comes close from the front, he also employs similar techniques - keeping your body out of the line of fire, grabbing the gun and turning it around so that the gunman can't fire.
At the same time, press weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, and turn the gunshot from his tightly held hands, then target him.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video and see what Mizrachi does.
But remember that if you are not a master of maga, the safest way to get rid of looting is to make money.
A rogue family destroyed an inexpensive rented home in Saltash, Cornwallshire before being expelled
A rogue family evicted for intimidation of its neighbours was destroyed before leaving, resulting in a loss of PS50,000.
After a long string of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were driven out of an inexpensive rented home in Soltash, Cornwallshire.
After being forcibly removed from the shelter, housing association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
There were holes everywhere on the wall, the floor was ripped off, garbage dumped full of land, and the walls were painted in a mess.
After being deported, the family has been moving and is said to be currently living in private residences.
Donna McEvoy, home manager of the Cornwallshire Housing Association, said she was worried that the house could no longer be saved.
"It's a nightmare for people living here, and I don't think people can live like that."
There are many things that need to be weighed down now, as this house is likely to become a less good element in Cornwallshire.
This family is notorious, and their names are equally infamous.
The couple have three sons and they will live here from time to time. Police said the family's terrorist acts included using baseball bats in the streets, intimidating nearby residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, yelling, quarrels and curses.
In June, the 47-year-old tenant named Skeldon received a resolution on antisocial behavior.
In the house that might have been demolished, many of the rooms were long-delayed.
In this room where drugs were once traded, the floor was lifted.
Neighbors said they often saw them fighting in the streets and were also frequently called to police.
After giving them a 11-week extension to leave voluntarily, the Cornwallshire Housing Association forcibly drove her and her husband out of the residence this week.
The neighbors who finally relaxed their breath cheered for it, saying that the previous life was simply human hell.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone."
We've been living next door for 20 years and have been so bad.
We've seen policemen come to the door countless times.
"This morning we can't sleep."
We got up early, because it's too quiet - we don't get used to it yet!
They finally left, it was great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive manager of the Cornwallshire Housing Association, said the family had not been able to work well with the local government.
The family lived in this house for 20 years and the police often visited it.
Rubbish and old toys were thrown on the side of this inexpensive rental weeds.
He added: "Unfortunately, the tenant did not bear any responsibility for her and her family's actions, and expulsion was the final consideration of the Connorshire Housing Association."
This is a very difficult case, because their actions are extremely extreme and what they do must be terrifying for neighbors.
I would like to thank my team for the work they have done, as well as Devonshire and Cornwall County Police and members of the community who bravely provided us with information.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to our neighbors and convey the message that we are intolerant of anti-social behavior.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but he also said that they were only 20 years old.
After they were evicted, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of their bedrooms.
Housing Association workers will soon clean up piles of rubbish around the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, as well as squash, drug use devices and PS1,700 cash.
After pleading guilty, Skeldon was fined for possession of Class B drugs and drug trafficking intent.
She claims the money was used to buy a gravestone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
It is understood that after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were painted full of graffiti.
Police said they would expel tenants who violated the rules of the tenant.
Angela Crow of Devonshire and Cornwall County Police said the deportation sent clear warnings to other tenants who continued to violate charter rules.
"This warning is aimed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed, as well as those who are crippled by such acts," she said.
Devonshire and Cornwall County Police are in no way tolerated by crime and anti-social behavior, and they will continue to work with partners to protect our community.
Reed: Hillary Will Be Elected President To Nominate Garland Into Supreme Court
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said he was confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is elected president, she would nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked the confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama's nomination in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reed said at a teleconference on Thursday that he predicted Hillary would choose "some credibility" Garland.
Reed's spokeswoman then said that Reed had not nominated Garland for direct dialogue with Hillary, saying he was just guessing.
He praised Garland and said Hillary's team did not want to "disturb" new candidates.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland's nomination were "darlings" and "achievers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not suitable for being president.
Treats: Nude Calendar "Loves Men and Women"
The Treats magazine will work with photographer David Bellemere to capture a set of inspirations from Pirelli's 2017 calendar in the 1970s.
This time, they plan to look for a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar rather than the famous naked people.
Steve Shaw, president of Dealats, said earlier this year that their nude magazines are different from the old-fashioned Playboys because "the latter is male-oriented."
We are targeting women.
Obviously, he thinks the same is true of this set of calendars.
"We need to show the everlasting and classic nudity that makes both women and men feel self-sufficient, and this is exactly what inspired it," Shaw said at a calendar promotion conference.
Women will be happy to participate in the film because it is a beautiful artifact.
Models can submit photo candidates online or personally to public recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video report shows that small-headed sleigh sharks are the longest living vertebrates
Scientists say the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, who has been studying sharks, said that according to data, the age of a female puppy shark is expected to range from 272 to 512 years old, with a body length of five meters.
French Court Rejects Petition for Demolition of Shops in Jungle Camp
A French court rejected a petition by the Government of Calais to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the "junk" refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At the court's hearing this week, the Government of Calais argued that the French government should be empowered to dismantle a total of 72 temporary stores in the camp. The people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks and provide barber services in these stores, as well as tea or basic meals at prices of 50 cents (40 pence) or several euros for temporary restaurants.
The office of the Governor of Galilee considers these places to be dismantled because they are a parallel economy that is not taxed, and there are also fires and health hazards.
Humanitarian groups, however, said the shops and restaurants were of utmost importance to the Court as free food provided by state-backed associations and other groups did not at all meet the growing needs of refugees in the refugee camp.
They say the temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelters and free food for those in need.
Ryle's court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said the concerns of the governor of Gallais were "completely understandable."
Judge Jean Francois Molla said the role of grocery stores, cafes and restaurants is far more than simply providing food to refugees who "live in extremely dangerous conditions."
These places, he said, are a calm confluence between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition is the Jungle Book Kids cafe in the refugee camp, which offers 200 food, English and French classes a day, as well as asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the refugee camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the cafe.
A letter to Guardian wrote that closing the cafe would be "a great disaster for these children, many of whom are only eight years old."
Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, the two charities, predicted on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps had surpassed 9,000, the highest level since the summer refugee surge.
"This $5,000 funding has cleared my rush."
Zhoufeng, a poor cardio girl in the village of Yugung Village, Huaigang County Governor, received an admission notice from South China University.
On August 9, when she was grieved about the cost of schooling, the county committee promptly paid her $5,000 in funding.
During the same day, the county departments also implemented 2.838 million yuan of school funding for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, for families whose economic situation is particularly difficult, they are also helped to complete their studies by organizing social fund-raising and other forms.
In this year, Huayuan has integrated more than 18.5 million yuan of school aid funds, and the financial self-financing of more than 2.5 million yuan, by the financial sector according to the specified time frame in the real bank card for poor students.
She said with gratitude: "I thought my dad had died, and neither I nor my brother were in college, and did not expect the county to solve our difficulties in time."
As of August 8, Huayuan has implemented more than $21 million in various rescue funds for 13,140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All poor students in the county have achieved a need for assistance, this supplementation.

Australia's New South Wales government announced on 11 that it would spend $200 million ($154 million) on the largest renovation since the construction of the famous Sydney Opera House.
The New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the Opera House.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jon Utson and built in 1973 to host about eight million visitors a year.
Rory Jeffs, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will take advantage of this transformation to "turn into battle" and become "one of the world's best audio-visual concert halls."
Non-Kyong citizens who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and meet one of the legally stable employment, lawfully stable residence, continuous reading conditions in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.
Recently, the Beijing Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit have been introduced, which means that "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residency permit".
The head of the relevant departments said that the transition from "temporary residence permits" to "residency permits" meant that Beijing's non-resident population would shift from "management" to multi-location services.
The reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation today that by the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels had published 2,470 "blacklist" cases of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State General Administration of Taxation took a first step in the central government functions and jointly with the Tax Credit Management Scheme published the Information Disclosure Method for Major Tax Violations Cases.
Not only will the facts of violations in these cases, legal basis, treatment of punishments be published, but the basic information of the parties to the violation and the relevant intermediary responsible persons will also be included in the "blacklist" together.
Quality inspection, finance, customs and other government departments have also taken relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.
"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the construction of the entire social credit system, which marks the continuous development and improvement of China's social credit system.
"Environmental problems are manifested in atmospheric, water and soil pollution, but the roots are still in the production lifestyle."
For example, in 2015, the land development rate of Jiangsu province was as high as 21%, ranking the highest in the national provinces and autonomous regions.
Therefore, the problems of high pollution, large energy and plurality have not been fundamentally addressed from the transformation of a productive lifestyle.
On the one hand, from the perspective of the effectiveness of creation of various ecological environment at all levels in Jiangsu Province, absolute advantage is ranked first in the country; but on the other hand, the resource environment carries a lot of pressure.
The solid promotion of ecological environmental protection and governance, the need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production way of life, in order to build ecological civilizations to facilitate transition and benefit people's livelihood.

Third-party companies (non-Chinese companies) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee to produce flags in Sao Paulo, Brazil, about 75 km from Sao Paulo.
In order to urge manufacturers to complete as soon as possible, China's Consulate General in Sao Paulo organizes specialised personnel to go to the manufacturer and do deep work.
After 30 hours of overtime, the manufacturer finally completed the production and loading of the Chinese flag to ship, which would have required 4-5 working days in advance.
It is reported that the flag is expected to arrive in Rio on 11, and after receiving the flag it will be sent to various Olympic venues, the entire process will be completed under the supervision of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate in Brazil.
On the 10th of this report, Nan Tong Municipal Government held a Shutong Industrial Cooperation Pleading in Shanghai International Conference Center, and more than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate.
The total investment of 8.063 billion yuan in the 20 projects focused on new energy, new materials and modern services sectors.
Qingdao is the country's 12th and also the first pilot city in Shandong Province for reimbursable use and trading.
On the 11th, a number of enterprises have come to Qingdao City Decontamination Rights Trading Center for submission of decontamination rights requisitions, and will pay paid royalties after acceptance of the requisition.
The first order of the transaction to be completed also foreshadows the official opening of the pilot work on Qingdao decontamination rights trading, which will also be the first order of the provincial decontamination rights trading and the first order of the national urban level decontamination rights trading.
On the morning of 11th, Zhao Xiping, general manager of Qingdao Dupu Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd., came to Qingdao City Decontamination Rights Trading Center for submission of decontamination rights requisitions.
The plant in Qingdao's old city district was completely shut down at the end of last year, and environmental protection relocated to flattened new plant area.
After Zhao Xuping submitted the application form, construction project environmental impact report and other materials, Qingdao Municipal Waste Management Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application material.
According to the levy standards determined by Qingda city prices, finance and other departments, the initial decontamination rights use fee is currently estimated at about 641.2 million yuan, and staff will complete approval within seven working days.
The first order of the transaction to be completed also foreshadows the official opening of the pilot work on Qingdao decontamination rights trading, which will also be the first order of the province's decontamination rights trading and the first order of the national urban level decontamination rights trading.
Zhao Xiping said that at present, the company's environmental protection has invested 400 million dollars, which is apparently huge, but it has a great impact on the concept of business management and social benefits, and opens up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Quartet Xinsheng Zhiqiao Bus Parts Co., Ltd. also came to requisition for the annual production of 4,200 high-speed rail and vehicle interior accessories projects.
The project belongs to the machining enterprises, and the initial discharge right is 0.514 tons/year for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 0.052 tons/year for ammonia nitrogen (NOX).
The right to discharge air pollutants is reimbursable and traded for the main industrial enterprises of electricity, heat production and supply throughout the city.
Existing sewage units that have received the EIA by January 1, 2016 are not subject to a reimbursable use fee.
"Reimbursable access to the right to discharge does not amount to obtaining an unlawful power to discharge and cannot emit contaminants at will."
Hanhong Yan, deputy director of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Agency, said that if illegal sewage and over-standard sewage pollution still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to circumvent punishment by purchasing their right to waste.
In other words, through legal means to strictly combat environmental violations and punish enterprises for over-standard pollution actions, thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health.
Now, for their own benefit, enterprises have increased the aggressiveness of pollution management, cherished limited discharge rights and reduced pollutant emissions.
With the drive of economic interests, reducing emissions from contaminants is transformed from government coercive behavior to enterprise conscious market behavior, thus truly achieving the purpose of protecting the environment, protecting nature and safeguarding public health.
The right to discharge, also known as "the right to discharge", is the right to emit pollutants, which refers to the right of emitters to release pollutants into the environment in accordance with the law within the amount allocated by the government.
This right is essentially the right of polluters to own, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
Next, if the total emissions of contaminants do not exceed allowed emissions, internal sources of pollution mobilise each other through currency exchange.
Since the 1968 U.S. economist Dells proposed in 1968, the United States has applied it to the management of air and river pollution sources in the 1970s.
China has been piloting since 2007, and currently there are 14 provinces (districts, cities) such as Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other countries in full implementation.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, in order to assist these six strategic bombers in carrying out air strikes against the "Islamic State" targets in Syria, several Russian warplanes have been upgraded and supported from the Syrian Khmeimim Air Base.
On February 22, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a cease-fire between the parties to the conflict in Syria, which began its implementation on Feb. 27.
According to the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the UN Security Council such as ISIS's Front for Support.
Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be guaranteed accordingly.
He also said that if extremist forces were not attacked, they would extend to Russia.
While Russia and the West have not reached an agreement on a joint fight against extremist forces in Syria, it will strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran, Iraq and others in this regard.
In September 2015, at the invitation of the Syrian government, Russia began a military strike against extremist forces in Syria.
On March 15, Russia's main military force in Syria began to withdraw, but the Russian side promised to continue maintaining its Air Force Base at Hemmim and Naval Base at Tartus.
In the case of new-born and successful hometowns, He Pei made a good demonstration: to pass on a hundred-year old house, but also to tell a story of inheritance of a land.
Today, an average of 100,000 people gather each year to the bamboo mountain, either bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner tranquillity.
In fact, the relationship between rural and urban should be accompanied by each other, like mother and child, without strength and weakness, no need to govern who, should be very warm.
There is no fixed model for rural development, but it is difficult to spontaneously change by the countryside, and the most important thing should be to let the right people go to the countryside.
Shanghai Songjiang District Transit Department recently used electronic police rectification drivers to drive and play mobile phones, and found more than 30 in a week.
With the popularity of smartphones, mobile phones are becoming more and more fun, brushing WeChat, sending Weibo or even playing games, shopping for Taobao is normal, many people seem to have a moment's insecurities from their phone, even when driving can not stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act explicitly prohibits driving and playing a mobile phone, defining it as "an obstacle to safe driving behavior."
Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not been properly punishable for such reasons as the number of offenders and difficulties in obtaining evidence, and the legal provisions have almost become tantamount.
If the control department can make a determination to "declare war" on driving and playing mobile phones, normalize this measure, such violations will certainly be curbed.
It is necessary to tightly manage household records, establish electronic and paper archives for the registration of unaccounted persons on a one-by-one basis, ensure that archival information is complete and effective.
Public security organs shall handle the registration of unaccounted-for persons and notify relevant departments in a timely manner.
The policy measures that are inconsistent with the spirit of this implementation will be centrally cleaned up, which will be carefully modified and resolutely repealed.
In a collective shed in Donglin Village, Taihang City, Wang Shifeng, 48, is spraying pesticides with workers to the pear tree.
The entire village has 150 acres of orchards, more than 10 species of trees, only 12 workers plus one technical engineer.
Last year, 50,000 dollars in total, like my age, if working at the factory certainly can't get that money.
Last year, Donglin village income reached 22 million yuan, of which the total agricultural income accounted for nearly half.
Village Secretary Sozifan: The per capita land cultivation area is increasing annually, just beginning 50 acres, now more than 100 acres; the average yield of a mu is increasing every year, and the income of professional farmers also has room for growth each year.
The biggest highlight of the collective economic reform in Sunan is to clarify the ownership of rural collective operating assets and explore political and secession.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations with their village and village committees "distributed management", the village committee fulfills the management of rural public affairs, cooperative organizations mainly engaged in business.
Two accounts of the two institutions do not "match" each other, to prevent the involvement of village cadres in collective asset management corruption.
Zhu Baoping, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Commission of Jiangsu Province, said that in the next step Jiangsu will continue to promote the reform of the community joint-stock cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a democratic power operation mechanism at the village level.
Ho Baoping: Further advance the reform, engage in community equity cooperation, quantify assets to social workers, fix them to farmers, and form clear ownership rights.
Through the Internet +, implementing his right to information, decision-making participation and democratic management supervision, three rights are implemented to farmers, which indeed makes it a normal mechanism for joint stock cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy of Sunan rural mainly formed four development models for asset leasing, corporate equity, agricultural development and joint development.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions have become an important platform for promoting the construction of the "Belt and Road" in Zhejiang province.
The success of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and a good foundation for continuing to explore emerging markets along the "Belt and Road" route, creating an integrated platform for overseas events.

Hamir added that another 34 people, including three firefighters, were injured and had been discharged from the hospital.
As some households remain unaccounted for, he also called on the residents of the fire-fighting apartment to contact the authorities.
Mariana Turay, who lived in the apartment for 30 years, said: "It's as if there was a bomb falling."
It is reported that the local fire brigade took an hour and 45 minutes to extinguish the fire, and residents of nearby buildings were allowed to return to their homes a few hours later.
The Red Cross estimated that about 100 people were homeless, of which 60 to 70 remained in shelters at nearby neighborhood centers, most of whom were Westerners.
On August 11, the first Jinzhou Wetland Tourism and Culture Festival opened at the "He Spring Lake" side of China's eastern city of Jinzhou.
Since 2014, the revenue generated by the tourism industry accounted for 10% of Jinzhou's GDP; in 2015 it reached 11.3%.
Oriental Huatian Wetland Hot Springs tourism area, located in Jinzhou City Linhai Da Economic Zone No. 1 of the Ring Hai Road, is 70 km from Jinzhou City Centre, 50 km from Linhai City Centre and 70 km from Panjin City.
The scenic area features indoor hot springs covering 3,000 square meters and outdoor hot springs covering 4,600 square meters.
Xiamen girl Zhang Bingbin: "Beauty of hand" began shooting careers several times "reversed".
Zhang Donghong in Dongyuan Village, Xiamen Xiangyang District, just changed his home's 29-inch old TV a few days ago to the 65-inch big TV.
The ordinary farmer's daughter, Zhang Bingbing, on the night of 11, was a silver medalist for China to win the three-seat final cards in the Rio Olympic women's 50 meters rifle.
On the night of 11th, just before this new TV, Zhang Dong Red couple and dozens of relatives and friends, together witnessed the amazing process of her daughter to rise up and straight after, from almost pre-match eliminated to almost a big reverse.
In the game of that day, Zhang Binbing once ranked downstream, it seems to be very far from the final.
But parents and friends did not give up, constantly brushing the text live broadcast, see with the other players finished, Zhang Bingbin ranked all the way up, finally locked the final seat, his home burst from a cheer.
In the final, Zhang Bingbin was once behind the ranking situation, the last few shots were more and more stable, only with a backward champion 0.2 ring score to win silver.
Zhang Bingbin, 27 years old this year, in his 16-year shooting career, actually had a few times almost wiped out with this difficult silver card.
Her mother Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that just as they hesitated, Zhang Bingbin found several "novel visitors" from the village.
These "novel guests" were the same village children who were recommended to participate in the training at the same time, including Zhang Bingbin's cousin.
Immediately after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbing once again took the initiative to return to Xiangyang school for family difficulties and other reasons.
But after his initiating coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly did the job, Zhang Bingbin returned to Xiamen team.
After entering the provincial team, Zhang Bingbin once again returned to his home because he was unable to see hope.
This time, not only Zhang Yaji coach, Xiamen Shooting Arrow Sports Center and Fujian provincial team leaders and coaches arrived at home, finally persuaded Zhang Binbing to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's match, this Xiamen girl insisted on a reversal of the shooting road.
"The way each coach chooses a teammate is different, when I saw that the hand of Bing was beautifully looked up and it came to me at once."
Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, although the daughter's score is not the best, but the number of rings scored is very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbing to attract coach.
In training Zhang Bingbin, Zhang's greatest impression was the input of the farmer's girl.
He recalled that Zhang Bingbin entered the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, in the team carried out stand-alone gun training, requiring the team member to not move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter has always been a quiet and kind child, since childhood he likes painting and handmade toys.
"Okay, I'm going to make clothes at home and sutures and add up, and Bing will pick some corners for himself to do a doll."
She said that her daughter often stitches handmade toys herself, plus she is good at painting, from the five officers of the doll to clothing, can always be done vividly.
As an athlete, Zhang Bingbin and his family gathered less than a lot, only on holidays can go home, usually by telephone.
Parents say that whether meeting or calling, Zhang Binbing rarely said his hard work, more than talking to parents about happy things.
Normally, I can't see my daughter, parents keep her paintings as a child at home and honors for years.
Zhang Xiaolong showed her daughter's cartoon to reporters, "If she is not a shooter, she should continue painting."
On the second floor of Zhang Binbing's living room, there was a cupboard filled with medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Dong Red Cross medals and medals were tidyly placed, the certificate was unified into the folder saved, "these are the honors of a decade of heartbreaking change, we all appreciate."
Recently, the Hebei Province Ji Xiaoyuan Fund sent 16,000 yuan of condolences to six families who had lost their relatives in Yixing County's small works, benches, Guiquan and other villages.
This is another gesture of condolence and caring after the Foundation sent a message to the community looking for "unaccompanied children and lonely elderly people in floods of 7.19".
7.19 Heavy rainfall has caused flooding in parts of Hebei province, resulting in deaths and disappearances in some parts of the province.
Good people's "old iron" due to the poor sacrifice of helping the area with compulsory drainage, leaving a 2-year-old young boy and wives in Jakoa, good people's "old iron" touches the entire provincial city.
On August 4, the staff of Hebei Province's Qi Xiao Foundation and Haibei brand volunteers came together to the good people's "old iron" home, handing out $3,200 in love with the "old iron" family.
When the brand's deputy president, Yeli, understood the status quo of the "old iron" family, immediately decided to carry out a "love-selling" activity in the company members of the brand meeting, helping the "old iron" family together difficult.
Hebei Province Cixi Foundation, all known as the Hebei Province Volunteer Service Foundation Chixi Foundation, was launched by the Hebei Branding Association Preparatory Committee and founded in August 2015.
According to the Hong Kong Oriental Daily reported on August 12, there are three main problems in the sale of domestic diamonds, including the netness of non-standard diamonds that pushes prices higher, the weight of non-standard diamonds, and post-sales insecurity.
And Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, where local craftsmen are famous for their diamond cutting technology, and the diamonds sold have been rigorously identified and well-received by mainland ladies.
"A small cloth bag, held in the heart of his hands, a little floppy and worth nearly a million dollars", a Liu surnamed mother who was involved in diamond buying, described her experience in Antwerp to the mainland media this June.
She said she was hiding the diamonds in her underwear, took them to the toilet for a few days, bathed and slept very tightly.
She claims that the diamond purchased in Antwerp is worth about 55,000 yuan per karat, and the same quality diamonds retail price in Xiamen is about 110,000 yuan.
She has already added 20% of the purchase price, sold all the purchased diamonds, and made over $200,000 at a time.
According to the domestic customs regulations, diamond non-passenger goods or necessities in the trip, therefore belong to the category of goods, must be declared at the time of entry and exit, otherwise or listed as smuggling, situation can be severely sentenced to prison.
According to foreign media reports, on the 10th local time, the British Prime Minister's office Downing Street announced that Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will spend a summer vacation in Switzerland, but did not disclose specific places of leave.
According to media, after the Brexit referendum, Britain's new prime minister opted for a "neutral state" holiday in Switzerland on the continent of Europe with some kind of political symbolism.
The Guardian commented that Switzerland, a neutral country, played a role in the symbolic choice of British Prime Minister's first resort.
The Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May had chosen to take a holiday in Switzerland, the first time after Mrs Thatcher had taken another British prime minister.
The choice of the two women's prime ministers and Blair and Cameron's preference for vacationing in hotter places formed a divergence.
Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May, will return to London on August 24 and wait for her after a series of important jobs and activities.
The British Parliament will reconvene on September 5, including the issue of a second Brexit referendum requested online.
The British referendum on June 23 decided to leave the EU, but Britain's new prime minister did not want to initiate paragraph 50 of the Lisbon Treaty regarding Brexit by the end of the year.
The existing non-material cultural heritage projects in Huangshan City are 1325, and each type and number is the first in the province.

China's Mars Plan is Coming
China's Mars exploration mission is to achieve a one-time encirclement, landing and inspection, this form has never been done abroad.
My country's Mars detection launch target is to encircle, land, and tour one step, and this task has considerable difficulty.
Because it takes 26 months for a time window to detect Mars, experts are working on rigorous engineering plans to launch our first Mars probe in 2020.
According to Xu Dajie, although China's aircraft has entered deep space, completing the mission of Mars exploration is still indispensable, and detecting Mars means that China enters the era of deep space exploration in a real sense.
"Once every two or three years, Mars has the most recent opportunity to launch a Mars rover at this point of time, which is the most energy-efficient for carrier rockets."
"Considering the quality of the Mars rover, we will be able to complete our launch mission by launching our long-range V carrier rocket."
China's Mars exploration mission is to achieve a rounding, landing, and inspection at one time, this form has never been done abroad, foreign countries have planned to achieve a rounding and landing, but the landing failed.
Mars detection involves a lot of technical areas, especially because while the rover is a space probe, it has distinct features compared to the general space probe.
In other words, the Mars rover must have the ability to determine the route and discover the danger of obstacles.
China Space Science and Technology Group's five-member researcher Pang Xiaohao said that the reason humans are so favored in detecting Mars is because detection of Mars has important scientific, technical and other aspects of significance, and even relates to the future of mankind.
Mars has now become the planet with the highest level of human research beyond Earth, and the history of man's use of space probes to detect Mars spans almost the entire history of human space.
Thus, humanity hopes to establish a habitual base on Mars one day, eventually immigrating to Mars and turning it into the second home of mankind.
There are also many indications that Mars was likely to have evolved like the current Earth before, and only after billions of years had it become a thin atmosphere, low temperature, and depleted water sources.
Therefore, the detection or manned landing on Mars for research can be a premise to prevent the Earth from becoming the second planet that humans cannot survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar explorations and 43 Mars surveys were carried out worldwide.
However, from the 1990s to the present day, a total of 18 Mars explorations were carried out by humans and only 14 lunar explorations.
There are currently five Mars Orbiters and two rovers working, but only one lunar Orbiter and a lunar lander.
The world's spacefaring powers have developed plans to target the Mars system, so it can be seen that today's detection of Mars is more heaty than lunar detection.
On November 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian", becoming Asia's first country to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangarian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere and mineral characteristics of Mars in order to find whether there are methane and signs of life on Mars.
The most difficult part of this mission is that the probe enters the Martian atmosphere after pneumatic shape and parachute slowdown only one chance.
According to Sun Zezhou, the master designer of the Mars probe in the overall department of China Aerospace Science and Technology Group Corporation's Fifth Chamber, the mission faces many technical challenges.
The pressure of the Martian atmosphere is very low, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth's surface, with high uncertainty.
Scientists have not yet come to a thorough understanding of factors such as its changes and stormtime characteristics.
Mars often forms a dust storm similar to Earth's sandy weather in the summer, which will lead to a sharp drop in sunshine energy received by rovers and must design a "dormant" mode for rovers so that they can wait patiently for the storm to pass through.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also has a curtailment effect on sunlight, which poses a challenge to the supply of energy for Mars detection.
This requires the detector's solar wings to be larger, and it needs to be continuously adjusted in order to target the direction of the sun.
Moreover, the gravity of the surface of Mars is only 38% of Earth, but most of the gravity is larger than that of the lunar surface, so the detectors need more power.
"The most core and difficult part of this Mars exploration mission is the process of pneumatic shape and parachute deceleration after the probe enters the Martian atmosphere, with only one opportunity to ensure success."
Sun Zezhou said that due to the distance between Earth and Mars, the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time, so it is necessary to rely on the detectors to independently complete.
Because there are not so many propellants to offset such a high speed, when landing on Mars, the slowdown depends on the role of the Martian atmosphere, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, the method of detecting Mars is similar to that of detecting the Moon, and it is also "circling, falling, patrolling, returning", which ultimately achieves the goal of manned landing on Mars.
Because Mars is much farther from Earth than the Moon, it takes a series of more complex technologies to detect Mars.
According to Taiwan's media reports, the Taiwan "administrative director" Lin all yesterday morning announced that "the political parties and their associated organizations improperly obtained property disposal regulations" have come into force since today.
"A more than a hundred-year-old Kuomintang, with social commitment and responsibility, will not fail."
Lin stressed that if political parties, affiliated organizations or trustees violate the prohibitions set out in the regulations, the Commission will investigate on its own initiative and "in accordance with the law" to impose sanctions.
Lin also announced that he was not elected as deputy chief commissioner of the Party and Production Committee, which would be chaired by Humbeccan, Taiwan's "sub-director of the CCAC."
He said that Gu Lixiong's role as the main committee of the improper Party and Proprietary Committee was not a two-person choice, taking advantage of Humbagan's past experience in investigating relevant major cases will serve as the basis for the Committee's identification of related miscarriages.
Jan Qisheng believes that today, as long as there is a party production, no one will give you social contributions, if the whole party production is collected and taken away, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "there is really no opportunity to go."
Jiang Qixiang also stressed that even if the party's regulations do not go to the way, the Kuomintang Party's production has not been fully purged and confiscated, the rest will still be donated according to the promise, so that the party's production is normalized to zero, and the party needs everything from zero.
Original title: "The Doctor of the Corridor", Lanyufeng v. Wang Zhian, CCTV moderator, defeat in the first instance
Due to the CCTV host Wang Zhian in Xinxiang Weibo's comments on the incident, Lanyufeng brought Wang Zhian and Beijing Wemoncreato Network Technology Co., Ltd. before the court.
Yesterday afternoon, the Haidian court issued a verdict on the case, which found Wang Zhian and Weapon not to constitute an infringement, and dismissed all of Lanzhou Peak's claims.
In early 2014, Wang Zhian, a CCTV journalist, found that although the Lanyu peak of more than 600 days in the hospital corridor was shaved by the media as a sad hero oppressed by the institutions, there is a lot of false information about these reports.
On 29 March 2014, the "Channel Doctor" program was broadcast.
The various so-called overmedication information Lanzhou Feng reported to the media is not supported by evidence.
Wang Zhian also described in a real name-certified microblog that "the reason why the Lanzhou peak has reached this step is character, its obvious paranoia personality and so on."
Lanyufeng asked Wang Chiang to remove Weibo, apologize for it and compensate for the mental damage relief of 100,000 yuan.
At that time, both sides slammed whether Wang Zhian violated the right to honour at Lanju Peak.
12 Point of view: Athletics start-up Chinese team is very busy female foot racing four bikes hope to break through
Bicycles are expected to achieve the Olympic gold medal "zero breakthrough", and female football maid will challenge two world champions Germany team, looking forward to blowing cold into the top four.
Wang Town has stood out for nearly two seasons, last year the Beijing Athletics World Championships harvested silver cards, and this May the group competed in the World Championships to upgrade its personal project champion.
According to foreign media reports, 27-year-old South Korean shooter female player Zhang Huizhen won gold medals in the women's shooting personal competition, after the group race again received Olympic gold medals, becoming a double crown.
Zhang Huizhen is considered an older player who has regretted not getting a ticket to the last London Olympics, but now stands proudly on the highest podium of the Rio Olympic Games.
Zhang Huizhen won a gold medal in the Women's Shooting Person Final at the Rio Sanba Ave Stadium in Brazil, 6-2 defeating Liza Onru of Germany.
She shot her first arrows at the fourth grade of primary school, and only won a personal gold medal for the first time at the World Cup in 2014 when she was 27.
Zhang Huizhen recalls, "There was no level before high school to be unable to participate in the national competition.
Zhang Huizhen only won the fourth place in the London Olympics four years ago, regretting that he lost his Olympic tickets, and can only sit down with his colleague and good friend Qifubi wins two gold medals.
Zhang Huizhen talks about his gold grab after the women's shooting ceremony, "until the end it is possible to shoot arrows as often as possible, which may have brought good results and satisfied.
The 28-year-old South Korean shooter "One Sister" and London Olympic shooting individual gold medalist Chipbey won the bronze medal.
Chipbe lost to Zhang Huizhen in the semi-finals, vying for bronze with Mexican player Alejandra Valencia.
In order to ensure that the bronze medals shed tears in the playing field, it is possible to understand the silently bearable burden of gold.
Firstly, the coaching group has accumulated a wealth of experience in continuous research, and secondly, the way science is trained, which requires long-term accumulation.
The Arrow team helps the team to concentrate and maintain normalcy through military training, night-time crossing of graveyards and so on.
Although not yet confirmed, many sources say that Apple's autumn 2016 announcement will take place in September and the iPhone 7 is coming.
Although Apple did not respond, there has been a continuous release of news about the new iPhone's functionality and configuration, even online even the iPhone 7 "real machine model" pictures.
The new generation of iPhones can be called "people's attention", hot, tight, rich and unavailable... If you want to buy the original product first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.
This exacerbates people's frustration with the new phone, "it has grown but can't project holographic images at all!"
Like other iPhones, the iPhone 7 was accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, several sources claim that the new iPhone will cancel 3.5mm headphone interfaces instead of using Bluetooth connections and charging interfaces, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.
Another evidence to corroborate the news is that as early as 2014, Apple allowed earphone manufacturers to produce headphone products connected via a charging interface.
These messages are either true or false, and the answer will not be undisclosed until Apple's 2016 autumn release.
But that doesn't prevent industry insiders from looking forward to the iPhone 7 - many believe it will likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
Despite recent data from IDC, the iPhone market share has plummeted.
Goldman maintained Apple's stock "buy" rating, while BMO analysts believed that the iPhone 7 would have a historic sales record.
At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said that Apple's future revenue growth is likely to exceed 20%, which is entirely due to the launch of the iPhone7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent of those who planned to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of the user population currently holding an iPhone 6 or 6Plus plans to buy an iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, there is an expert analysis, and most fruit powders like to replace their own iPhone cellphones in the next generation.
According to statistics, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for two years, that is, nearly 120 million iPhones have been used for two years.
According to media, during the production of the iPhone 7, Taiwan suffered several earthquakes "the level of destruction of the TSMC electricity production facilities exceeded expectations and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7."
Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low price to start the original iPhone 7.
According to people familiar with the information, recently, Suning high-rise meeting with Apple company frequently, the purpose is to prepare ample source of goods.
Operators have already talked to Suning, and it is foreseeable that with the deep cooperation of both sides, there will inevitably be a lower price and more discreet service for users.
"At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy an iPhone 7 for just $7 a day."
Ample supply and a variety of advantages, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 no longer "pressure mountains", and Suning logistics will make this beautiful to become more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hello, Suning Easy Buy, your iPhone 7 is here."
The organizers hope to make the local people more aware of the historic Chinese culture through the Cultural Heritage Exhibition, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Barcelona's "Ming dynasty artifact exhibition" is part of the European tour, which will last until early October.
Huaxia Bank and Pufa Bank released the 2016 semi-annual report yesterday, and in the second quarter SFC again began to increase its shares.
Among them, 29.2931 million shares were added to Huaxia Bank by the end of June, and the number of Chinese securities held in Huaxia Bank has increased to 387 million shares, accounting for its share ratio from 3.35% to 3.62%.
In addition, according to the survey of bidding securities, deducting the transfer increase, Sino-Scientific Fund in the second quarter also increased 38 million shares held by PUF Bank, and its number of shares increased to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for the share of PUF Bank at 2.77%.
Recently, the Hobo Garden of Lion Hama in Tongshan City, Zhengfu Village, Zhejiang Province officially opened to villagers and tourists.

The rural flower industry and its ornamental, leisure and economic benefits have become the highlight of local new rural development.
According to foreign media reports, due to the jumping pool of water from blue and green, the Rio Olympic "green pool" event has been closely watched by the outside world.
However, on the morning of 10th, the water in a bowl matching pool adjacent to the skipping pool also turned green.
Australian waterball players said after the match that his eyes felt stabbed and wanted tears.
Previously, officials at Rio Olympics confirmed the situation of greening the pool water and said that the coloring of the pool water is due to the weakening of alkaline and will not affect the physical health of athletes.
But Australian athletes said after winning a match with the Japanese team in the pool, their eyes were stabbed.
The first time the skipping pool water became green, the game organizer overtime on the night of 9 to deal with the problem of skipping pools, but in the morning of 10 it was discovered that the color of the bowling pool also changed rapidly.
The environmental conditions of the pool deteriorated during the Australian team's game with Japan, but officials stressed that they would restore water quality to their original color on 11th.
Rio Olympic spokeswoman Mario Andrada said: "After yesterday's noon, the alkaline level of water in a swimming pool first weakened."
"We understand a number of reasons that may cause chromaticity in the pool and the alkalinity of water quality."
A series of water quality tests were carried out by the Aquatic Sports Center, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pool to determine how well they met the standards."
"We've been going through normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the more athletes are likely to have an impact on water quality."
"But changes in water color will certainly have no effect on physical health, especially for athletes."
"This independent team confirmed our assessment, as well as the steps we have taken to restore the pool to its normal color and chemical state."
"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by rain."
According to Taiwan's "Central News Agency" reports, an explosion in a prison outside the Greater Manila area occurred yesterday night, causing the jailer to be injured and 10 prisoners died, including two Chinese.
ABS-CBN TV reported that the incident occurred at around 9:00 last night in Paranaque prison, but police did not make preliminary statements until 2:00 this morning.
Police said the 10 inmates had approached the prison chief and complained of being transferred to custody, but both sides were not speculative, with prisoners throwing hand grenades and causing explosions.
Prisoners have not yet announced the names of the dead prisoners, but GMA TV reports that included two Chinese.
As at 8 a.m., the jailer had not yet provided detailed information on how prisoners were able to obtain hand grenades.
Yesterday, the central Philippine police entered the district prison in Leyte province and killed a "trying to attack police" culprit.
Urumqi regulates the tourism and passenger market operation order travel agency must sign a contract with tourists
Now Xinjiang has entered the tourist season, to regulate the operation of the tourism bulk market, Urumqi City Tourism Enforcement Unit Joint Municipal Transportation and Regulatory Authority Law Enforcement Unit yesterday did not regulate the presence of tourist vehicles in the mass passenger market, and the low contract rate between travel agencies and tourists was investigated.
At eight o'clock in the morning, about 10 tourist buses were parked around the Kempinski Hotel, most of them as a group of hikers on a day trip to Skypool.
"Hello, I'm in Urumqi City Tourism Agency, you signed a contract with this travel agency?"
Yu Bin, a staff member of the law enforcement branch of the Urumqi City Transportation and Regulatory Authority, said: "Exotic tourism vehicles and shuttle cars operate tourist and passenger transport projects in the Urumqi market, there is no qualification for practice."
"The super-wide operation imposes a fine of 30,000 to 100,000 on this penalty, and the driver's lack of an eligibility certificate is a fine of $2,000."
It is understood that the tourism law enforcement department of Urumqi City has already inspected places where tourist dispersers are concentrated in Western Park, Red Mountain and other areas.
Combining the situation of two inspections, Maggie, deputy head of the Urumqi tourism law enforcement branch said: "The first is security, the second is standardization, there are no small things about tourist vehicles, and once problems arise, it is a group of injured people who die."
"We continue to conduct inspections of the market in cooperation with the Transport Authority and regulate the behaviour of travel agents as a vehicle that ensures safety for tourists."
On the morning of August 12, the press office of the State Council held a press conference on the national economic performance in July 2016.
The spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics and the Director of the Integrated Statistical Division of the National Economy said that in July, the growth rate of some indicators of the national economy slowed but still operated within a reasonable range.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics show that in July, data on fixed assets investment growth and total imports declined.
As for the national economic performance in July, I would like to borrow a phrase once said by the prime minister that "there are fluctuations and still good", which can better summarize the characteristics of the economic performance in July.
He explained that "shape fluctuations" meant that some of the economic indicators in July were indeed rebounding.
Because the domestic and foreign economies are still in deep adjustment in July, the international situation is complex and variable, and the recovery of the world economy is not as expected, so the export pressure is still relatively high.
From the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is released, and the economy faces no small downward pressure, so some indicators are fluctuating.
In July there was also a special situation, flooding disasters are more severe, high temperature and hot summer weather has had some impact on production and operations in some areas.
According to the recent announcement by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people across the country were affected by disasters, and direct economic losses exceeded 200 billion yuan.
In terms of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these regions are affected to varying degrees.
In July, cargo turnover was down 3.6 percentage points faster than last month, and floods had a certain impact on traffic in those areas.
From these factors, some of the indicators in July fluctuations were also normal and expected.
He said that "the situation is still good" means that despite the economic growth rate has declined, but the overall operation of the economy is smooth, stable and forward-looking strong momentum has not changed.
In July, the CPI rose 1.8%, an increase of 0.2% per cent; in January-July, the CPI rose 2.1%, so the price situation was generally stable.
According to the Chongqing City Meteorological Bureau portal statistics on high temperature weather in each district and county, in addition to Yoyang, all other parts of my city can receive a different degree of high temperature allowance.
At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of subsidy distribution, but the standards issued by each province and municipality are different, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance according to the method of high-temperature working day allowance.
For those below 37degC above 35degC, they are issued at no less than 10 yuan per person a day; more than 37degC, they are issued at no less than 15 yuan per person a day.
Employees with high temperatures above 40degC can receive up to $20 per day a month's allowance (except for workers who have already enjoyed the high-temperature job allowance according to law).
According to this standard, last month the highest number of hot weather days in Kaizhou can reach 330 yuan, the smallest number of days is 80 yuan, and Yoyang's highest temperature because it does not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, a number of units will defray high temperature subsidies with cool drinks, and the city security supervision and administration said that such actions are not in line with existing methods.
The employer shall not deduct or reduce the worker's wages because of high temperature weather and shortening working hours.
The Municipal People's Social Bureau said that if employees encounter high-temperature jobs but are confiscate to high-temperature allowances, they can obtain legal rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the enterprise is located, or call 12333 complaints.
If the employing unit refuses to issue a high-temperature allowance, the worker can complain to the competent department of human resources social security at or above the county level.
At the same time, because high-temperature allowances are part of wages, not benefits, it is necessary to include the total wage and deduct taxes.
Therefore, the high-temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage and must be issued in cash and cannot be substituted for drinks such as beverages.

The official entry into operation of the Urumqi new passenger station will become an important platform for Xinjiang to build a national integrated transport city, promoting the construction of the "Silk Road Economic Belt" and the new zone.
Graceia is a burgeoning female giant mouth bird that radiates the breath of tropical rainforests.
In the Central American countries of Costa Rica, giant mouthbird Grecia and its story have long been household-known.
At a press conference on August 10, post-operative recovery Grecia finally debuted to show people its new 3D printed plastic bird beak.
It was a year and a half ago that the crippled, dying giant mouthbirds were finally reborn.
This day not only declares that it has recovered 100% of its health, but also the day it moves into luxury birds and meets with human friends who care about it.
Grecia, who first entered the new home, was somewhat shy, but not too often became lively, rolling in the water basin and eating grapes with a new beak.
In order to remind people of the damage it once suffered, technicians did not give it a new beak color, but retained the original white 3D printed material.
Outside of the bird's beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, inside and empty, only some fine bone support rods are intersecting.
Although there is this internal reinforced component, the beak of a giant mouthbird is still fragile and broken when hurt.
Animal Rescue Centers, ornithologists and a U.S. 3D printing company worked together to make several "test beaks" for Grecia, finally creating the "perfect beak" that best suits it.
Grecia is now skilled in drinking water, eating and even pecking fine grains with new beaks.
"The final finished product was designed for about two months, and it took only four or five hours to print out."
"3D printing is not a future technology, it has really entered your life," Thomas Lange, chairman of the SG3D printing company in the United States, said in an interview with Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a farm in Grecia, the province of Arahuela, central Costa Rica, was discovered with bloody giant mouthbird Grecia.
At the time, its upper beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it is completely unable to eat and life is in jeopardy.
After media coverage, Grecia's tragedy sparked a rush of anti-maltreatment calls inside and outside Costa Rica.
We call for stricter animal protection laws and increased penalties for abusers.
People come spontaneously and do their best to help Grecia restore life before the injury as much as possible.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of Grecia's beak.
"The situation in Grecia is special, and the rest of its upper beak is less than 1 cm, so there are many difficulties for installing a new beak."
"We first scanned Graceia, then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly larger than the rest of its beak, fixed on its upper beak with adhesive."
"This would reduce further invasive damage to Grecia," Lang told Xinhua International.
Before installing the prosthesis, staff would clean up a broken beak for Grecia every day in order to prevent infection.
Far a thousand miles away, the story of giant mouthbird Grecia touched the famous documentary director Paula Eredia and producer of Discovery News Channels John Hoffman.
They recorded nodule drops during the installation of Grecia's new beak, recording a documentary "Country of Giant Birds," which was broadcast on Animal Planet Channel this month.
The documentary "Country of the Giant Snoring Birds" shows people how a small giant bird can make a country change for it, and how to involve nationals in combating animal abuse.
Japan's oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small, independent refineries in China known as a teapot.
Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for a downturn."
Japan's oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small, independent refineries in China known as a teapot.
China's oil product quality is gradually approaching Japanese oil products as the Chinese government strengthens environmental protection regulations.
Before obtaining a permit for crude oil imports, the teapot refineries generally imported heavy oils with higher sulfur content from Russia and other places for refining.
The high sulfur content of petroleum products produced and poor oil products have become one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining a crude oil import license, the teapot refinery was able to import Omani and Russian crude oil with low sulfur content, and its petroleum products were also improved.
"As the quality standards of oil products in China continue to improve, refining equipment capabilities have also increased.
As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China has gradually reached the same level as (the world's highest-quality) Japan.
JX Energy said, "After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia" and competed with Japanese products in the Asian market.
Although "Japan's high-grade oil" is facing a crisis, Japan's oil companies are taking the response strategy only to "focus on market conditions while exporting to profitable areas."
Due to the huge impact of oil products exported by China on the Asian market, attention to teapot refineries is also increasing.

The range of funding for this activity is the admission of new students to college undergraduates, which does not include tuition-free professionalism; quality and excellence, and family poverty.
New Zealand's population growth was previously more than 2 percent during the birth peak of "baby boom" populations only in the 1974 and early 1950s and 1960s.
As of June this year, New Zealand's net influx of migrants within 12 months amounted to 691,000 people, making it the main driver of population growth in recent years.
In addition, during the same period, New Zealand's population grew by 282,000 people.
Data show that in the last 10 years, New Zealand's average annual net migration inflow was 218,000 and a natural increase of 323,000.
From a demographic point of view, the large influx of migrants means that the proportion of "working-age" people aged 15 to 39 is gradually increasing.
In the 12-month period as of June 2016, New Zealand's working age population increased by 3.6 percent to 1.58 million.
At the same time, the increase in ageing population over 65 is also 3.6%, reaching 700,000 people.

UV not only makes the students' skin darker, but also sunburns the skin, how to make the skin smoothly through military training and not sunburn?
The sunscreen packaging is generally marked by SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sunscreen index, which is aimed at UVB ultraviolet rays, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50 etc.
The products marked with PA are targeted at UVA, so that sunscreen will play a more effective role, usually the strength of PA is represented by +, and one+ indicates an effective protection time extension.
Oily skin should choose water-based sun protection products with stronger permeability, and sun protection spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose frost sun protection products; neutral skin is generally not strictly prescribed, sensitive skin to wipe any maintenance product is a burden, it is recommended to choose pure physical sun protection products.
Remember to apply sunscreen for half an hour in advance, as sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate the skin.
Wartime sunshine is longer, sunscreen wipes every two hours in order to have lasting effect, and do not lazy.
Because the skin has just been irritated by sun exposure, military training to come back do not immediately use white products.
After the military training sun, if conditions are available towels packed with ice to icing burned skin to slow local dull heat.
Farmers who bought farm aircraft during the exhibition continue to implement an increase in subsidy policy, and farmers can buy agricultural machines up to 40% of subsidies.
This exhibition is aimed at global bidding and exhibition, in particular increased the intensity of invitations to countries along the "Belt and Road" and target market countries.
This exhibition strives to complete 60 bidders signing projects, introduce funds of 22 billion yuan, and sign more than 160 trade contracts, the contract amount of 3.2 billion yuan.
It is reported that the "Shengbo Association" has settled Luo Dai for seven consecutive years, due to the strong base of manufacturing industry in Luo Dai City, Hunan Province, and a long history of industrial development.
As the host of "Shengbo" Loudi has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
"Shengbo Association" has become an important platform for local nurturing the development of characteristic industries and promoting the exit of specialised industries.
On some nights, the ionosphere is full of free electrons, which means that radio signals can go even further.
According to the U.S. publication "Volkswagen Science" website on August 11, the US Air Force is interested in replicating this effect.
While the ionosphere with a stable large amount of free electrons can help people listen to this radio at the edge of some university radio station, it may not be an interest in the U.S. Air Force.
The electron-filled ionosphere means that the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts, and it may provide some protection for GPS signals from solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of cube satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ionosphere when needed.
But first of all, the teams who signed contracts with the Air Force must prove that the science principle works.
According to industry data, in 2015 the total size of coal production capacity was close to 6 billion tons, and the country's coal output exceeded 1.8 billion tons.
Over the past 10 years, the State Department has issued five notifications to eliminate excess and backward production capacity.
Although the first four times did not target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November to January this year, Qinhuangdao's 5,500 CA power coal price has long been hovering at a low of 370 yuan/ton, with 90% of coal companies falling into losses.
Since February, coal prices have gradually recovered, and the price of Qinhuangdao power coal has risen four consecutive weeks to a 16-month high, once climbing to 436 yuan per ton, up nearly $70 from the beginning.
As prices rise, there is concern around the following: Will a handful of small coal mines be recommissioned?
In this regard, the head of China (Hainan) Institute for Reform and Development Economics Wang Sheng scrutinized and interpreted.
Quan Singming: Going to production capacity has attracted great attention from all parties, and today's published transcripts of the coal industry going to production capacity have indeed made everyone more worried.
These three hierarchical factors also reflect the relative lag behind our growth shifts in the past, because government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed.
Second, it is also directly related to the local government's push force, in the process of decapacity, funds and corresponding supporting measures must be in place, from this point of view, the differences between different regions are indeed large.
Thirdly, if some provinces with slower current progress are to catch up in the second half of the year, they may face greater risks.
In this case, relying on central reimbursable funds to advance the process of decapacity may have a certain negative impact.
First, to go production capacity is not easy to carry out total control.
Our goal is to reshape the new business model of the entire coal industry by eliminating backward production capacity, promoting optimization of structure.
In the process of deploying to production capacity, local governments must combine the transformation and upgrading of production capacity and coal industry with a strong development of related services.
Secondly, in order to complete this year's task of de-capacity, we still need to fully utilize the power of administrative supervision and administrative inspection.
Finally, we need to strengthen the bottom-line role of social security.
Because the market directly deals with employment issues, we need to strengthen training in job skills for employees and workers.
"The decline is due to the deteriorating expectations of foreign investment for Brazil's GDP growth in the medium term."
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global FDI was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The Swiss Bank's International Investment Attractiveness Index consists of four subdivisions: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and direct investment volumes.
In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment amounted to $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, the "green land investment" in Brazil (investment model to invest in factories abroad) amounted to $17.9 billion, a decrease of 2.1% year-on-year.
"There are 288 greenfield investment projects in Brazil, compared to an average of 314 between 2003 and 2014."
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, a nearly 10% increase compared to the same period last year.
Canada Police Shooting ISIS Supporters: Homemade Bomb Attacks Near the End of Preparedness
Taxi companies said the taxi was dispatched to Dreyffer's home before police arrived.
In a news conference on Wednesday, Canadian police said the information they received included "martyrdom videos" provided by the FBI about the young man's attack.
According to German Voice, a man wearing a black barraclaw hat is reading the Koran, mentioning crimes against Muslims and vowing to launch an attack on a Canadian city soon.
He said in the video that the attack would occur within 72 hours and at peak times.
The incident was the first time after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year, when police shot a terrorist suspect before the incident.
The upgrading of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal lane, Wanfu River and Bei Da Cayong Road from September 1, will charge a pass fee.
The two straitways adopt a method of social financing for transformation and construction, and the fees have been approved by relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Old Wanfu River lane runs through Jinxiang and Fishing Plate, via Lake Nanyang into the main lane of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the need for air traffic, the Old Wanfu River lane adopts a method of conservation and transformation, deep-draining local water depth has been carried out, local pressing bends have been cut straight so as to improve navigation conditions.
The route runs through Jinxiang County, Yongcheng District, via Lake Nanyang into the main lane of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a total length of 19 km.
In February 2011, the renovation of two routes began construction and completed completion of inspection and acceptance in January 2015, investment building and operation of the main body is the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center Jining City.
In accordance with the principle of "credit construction, fee repayment", Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center levies shipping pass fees according to the tariff standard approved by Shandong Provincial Pricing Bureau.
Among them, the basic pass fee is calculated at 1.75 yuan/load weight tons, and the mileage pass fee is calculated at 0.05 yuan/km load tons.
The excise fee is collected from June 15, 2016 until June 14, 2019.
The reporter learned from the Jining City Port Authority that at present there are four charging routes in Jining, namely Shui River lane, Baima River lane, Bei Da Cayong Road, and Old Wanfu River lane.
Four routes for the tributary of the Grand Canal of Beijing and Hangzhou, all are upgraded in a way of social financing.
The upgrade and transformation of the Sukhoi River lane project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model, used for the construction of infrastructure in Handong Province, government accounted for the main investment, social fund replenishment funding gap.
The Baima River, the Old Wanfu River, and the Northern Grand Chicken River are used as a way of pure market-oriented operation.
The funds allocated by the national finances cannot meet the needs of engineering construction, constraining the progress of the upgrading of the navigable route.
The use of social funds for the construction of public infrastructure conforms to the requirements of national policies, and also becomes a way to crack the funding bottleneck.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100-meter freestyle semifinal has made many Chinese viewers speechless.
But just in the 50-meter freestyle presumption, Ning Zetao once again refreshed people's "bottom line".
In fact, 50 meters of freestyle is not the main item of Ning Zetao, his performance and best results at the Kazan World Championships also determined that he was unlikely to achieve a breakthrough in this project.
Indeed, Hong Kong's authoritative media "Big Bulletin" revealed that the biggest reason Ning Zetao lost was because he had lost interest in swimming.
Many outside factors may have had a big impact on his ideas for the future, and he might now be more interested in entering the entertainment industry.
After the Kazan World Championship, Ning Zetao became a netizen with its ultra-high color value and good results.
Therefore, the "national husband", "small fresh meat", and other names are also constantly becoming labels on him.
A variety of business activities find the door, a good money way, to become a golden glittering avenue.
In this case, even if Ning Zeta chose to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle, not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable path.
After all, he is only 23 years old, after a certain degree of study, can fully play one or two television series with his popularity.
But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he or she has enough qualifications compared with these predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Liu Xuan, a 21-year-old, has reached the end of his career as an athlete.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered, and also laid the foundation for her future entry into the entertainment circle.
After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in several television series and set up his own studio in 2013.
Tian Liang participated in the single-double ten meters of the two Olympic Games and received 2 gold and 2 silver.
But after losing to teammate Hu Jia in the 2004 Olympic single-player ten meters game, Tian Liang's competitive status fell and was detonated and expelled by the diving team.
And he and his daughter participate in the "Where's Dad Go" such a comprehensive show, which also makes him earn an eyeball.
The former Gymnastics Gold Generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping and Chen Yi Ice were high-profile participants in various comprehensive arts programs.
It is worth mentioning that Yang Wei Li Xiaoping led China to win the 2008 Olympic men's team championship, and Yang Wei twice won a personal all-power gold medal, known as Almighty King.
Chen Yang Ice, while leading China to the 2012 Olympic group champion, also became a hanger king.
After a misjudgment of gold medals at the London Olympics, Chen's ice-breaking move also made him ring innumerable.
But the main energy of these athletes at present is still in the field, for all-time shows are just like a dragonflies - come and go.
But whether retired or active athletes, to be able to get the favor of the entertainment circle need to have a hand-held score to ensure.
After all, the athlete embarks on a new field, whether it's ability or contact, is a blank state.
Even Tian Liang, Liu Xuan such a mix of entertainment circles for years "old people", ordinary audiences mention them, more still think about their performance at the Olympics.
And Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping and other new people, in the introduction of the comprehensive show, no exception are "Olympic champions".
Compared to the above several people, Ning Zetao's reputation as a swimming world champion is still slightly thin.
Moreover, compared with the achievements of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, Ning Zetao if at 23 years old, sports career a slight setback will be eagerly retreated, the negative impact on its image is probably immeasurable.
After all, raising the athletes, people's demands are "do not ask for a hundred victories, but do not be afraid of hardship", Ning Zetao is still far from this.
10,000 steps back to say that Ning Zetao is handsome and can rely entirely on the pigments for thousands of brain rubbish support.
No power, relying only on the appearance, want to mix in the entertainment circle, this difficulty is not more difficult than training to find a response to some state.
The path of life is chosen by the individual's will, but how to choose, Ning Zetao should have a number in his heart.
On the surface, web-based social platforms extend the circle of communication and reduce people's loneliness.
The sphere of influence of cyber socialization is becoming more and more widespread, not only gradually replacing traditional telephone contact, but even infiltrating into the real life circle below the line, quietly changing the social life of the present people.
The benefits of online socialization are obvious, such as convenience and quickness, so they are particularly vulnerable to younger groups.
A survey of college students' social habits showed that 57% of college students used mobile phones for more than five hours a day, and their daily routine was basically "not hand-in-hand."
"Social networks have low cost, fast transmission speed, multi-player communication and other characteristics that meet the needs of contemporary university students."
Expansion of the circle of human relationships, more equal dialogue and avoid social concerns are the main reasons why we increasingly love online conversations.
The newcomers who have just entered the company love to communicate with their colleagues online, "because everyone is not familiar with the unit, through the praise of social platforms, the relationship is much closer than before."
Love dating is also commonly used online communication, "before and friends because some misunderstanding will not contact for a while, then in a large group of first conversations several words to warm up again."
IT engineer Wu is a deep network social enthusiast, most of his social life takes place on the Internet, and online contacts are more than double the number of friends from offline.
Wu himself also confessed that on the network more "like fish water".
"You can respond to your friends when you're comfortable, because there is a lot of time to digest words and the statement can be clearer."
"You come to me hiding under the ID and avoid face-to-face human collisions, not only with room for swirling but even giving each other more time and space to think about things."
"People of different identities have the same right and efficiency to speak, all kinds of social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace."
However, Wu's friend Xiaopeng believes that Wu's words in life are "an uninteresting home man."
Xiao Peng and Wu met in a large group, because both were active speakers, and soon became acquainted.
Xiao Peng felt that Wu's words and the network will judge if two people, speech is dull, nor actively express opinions, to turn over a few words "huh, good, yes," or not "this I want to check on the Internet."
Linguistic water police have now intervened in the investigation, and the Linguistic water transport department will also increase efforts to remediate illegal operating vehicles.
"The conflict police on 4 August did not have any investigation, and the taxis of two other drivers were hit again at midnight on 11 August."
"The current three-wheelers operate more illegally at night, and it is hoped that the authorities can increase their efforts to rehabilitate them."
The South China Sea Network reporter learned from the Public Security Bureau of the Manchurian Autonomous Prefecture that the police have now accepted the reports of these two cases, and the causes, who was responsible, and whether there is any association in both cases are being investigated further.
Wang Wenyi, head of the traffic management station of the Linguistic Water Transport Bureau, said that the Linguistic water transport department began to crack down on illegal passenger tricycles in the beginning of this year and banned a total of 613 illegal battalions carrying passenger tricycles.
Next, the transportation sector will apply to the county government and joint multi-sector efforts to improve the treatment of illegal operating vehicles such as tricycles, motorcycles, and black cars throughout the county.

On August 11, when the journalist's telephony interview returned to Huang Yilin of Shikawa's Yangyang family, she said: "The situation was too urgent, and only one thought in my heart was to save people!"
Huang Yilin is a 2015-year student at the Central and Southern Linco Gardening College.

"The little boy has gone missing, the little girl is desperately trembling in the water, only her small head on the river surface, from time to time sinking", as a child learning to swim Huang Eileen jumped up and rescued.
After drowning, 165 cm tall yellow Irene found that it was not the end!
The surface of the water that looked calm before, but beneath it was a tidal stream!
But she rushed to the little girl undisturbed.
Huang Yilin said that the river is turbid and rushing, less than 5 meters away, almost all of her strength.
She did her best to push the little girl on the river embankment, "the slope is particularly slippery, I am afraid of my own strength and sinking."
So, Huang Yilin asked for help from his mother, hearing the call of her daughter, poor watery Ms. Yin was ready to go down and rescued by the next tourists.
On August 10th, after the events of Huang Yilin's jumping river rescue spread, Ms. Yin received many family and friends condolences and praises while also being "accounted for" by a number of relatives and friends.
"To be honest, when the child can't stand fast on the embankment, my heart is shattered."
Ms. Yin said with trembling, although it is dangerous, but if you are again placed in such a scene, she will still support the choice of her daughter, and she is proud of her daughter!
Because of being forced, Huang Yilin after learning to swim rarely took the initiative to go down again, "unexpected that this skill is really put into use."
According to Chan Yiong, the head of Huang Yilin's class introduced that Huang Yilin is a recognized "school bully" in Bangui and is happy to help.

Northeast Tigers are currently listed as endangered (EN) species by the World Conservation Union's Red List of Endangered Species.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, in 1998 data from joint monitoring by China, the United States and other countries showed that Jilin province only wild Northeast Tigers (4-6) and Northeast Leopards (3-5).
According to Changchun, the head of the protection department of Jilin Forestry Department in Changchun, in recent years Jilin Province has increased its protection of wildlife, and the number of Northeast Tigers and Northeast Leopards in China is growing significantly, and the distribution area continues to expand.
In 2015, the latest monitoring data showed that in Jilin province alone there were 27 wild northeast tigers and 42 Northeast leopards monitored.
As the world's flagship species of wildlife conservation distributed across the border between China and Russia, cooperation between China and Russia is important for the restoration and reproduction of wild northeast tigers and leopard populations.
According to the Forestry Department of Jilin Province, Jilin province has established a long-term stable cooperation and exchange mechanism with Russia.
At the 2016 China Hun Spring Tiger Panther Conservation International Forum, which ended on November 11, Chinese and Russian forestry departments and animal conservation organizations reached a number of consensuses again.
Jilin Provincial Forestry Department said that strengthening cooperation between China and Russia in the protection of tigers, leopards is not only a very urgent task facing Northeast Tigers and leopards, but also a priority to maintain the health of Russian tigers and leopard populations.
As a leader of the party's members, Sun Fu firmly lost his ideal beliefs, grossly violated the Party's discipline, and after the 18th Congress of the Party still did not retreat, do not take hands, headwind violations, bad character, serious plot.
After this case, after several media reports, the focus of the case became a very bad social impact.
After the case took place, Haikou City Public Security Bureau police detachment leadership attaches great importance and immediately organizes a large team of careful police force to launch an investigation.
Police immediately enforce the suspect's Internet tracing, take a variety of measures to regulate and coordinate with the local police to check the fate of a certain country.
Because the suspect is a rapist, repeatedly dealt with by public security organs, has a strong anti-scanning ability, coupled with his long-term drug use, interrogation and poisoning addiction often occur, interrogating work is very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small-headed sleeping sharks, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland with a height of 4 to 5 meters.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm long for a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an exceptional life span.
Traditional chronological methods usually use animal calcification tissue, some sharks can use the fin ridge, but this calcification tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to radiocarbon dating using the eye lattice of Greenland sharks.
This method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is still the first time that fish such as sharks are determined.
Their analysis showed that the shark's life expectancy was estimated at 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old, with a maximum possible age of 512.
In addition, female Greenland sharks are said to mature sexually by about 4 meters in length, which translates into at least 156 years of age.
The researchers therefore wrote in their paper that Greenland sharks are the most known and longest-lived vertebrates on Earth, surpassing previous long-lived champion cleft whales (211 years old).
For a year, the results of remittance change were significant, and the RMB exchange rate remained basically stable, while also laying the foundation for promoting the internationalization of the RMB.
From the market performance point of view, for a year, the RMB exchange rate double-directional floating characteristics are obvious, exchange rate elasticity is enhanced, and exchange rate expectations are generally smooth.
To date, the upward and downward fluctuations in the RMB against the US dollar's median price have repeatedly occurred, but the process of depreciation has alternated.
Last year's "8-11" remediation measure was implemented in 2005, with a significant appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar over a decade.
Since the implementation of the new exchange rate, the RMB has changed its previous appreciation status, with an average value depreciation of about 8% over a year.
On October 1, the International Monetary Fund will formally accept the RMB as a weighted currency of the SDR (special drawing rights).
This week, statistics released by the Chinese Customs Administration show that in the first seven months of this year, the total value of China's imports and exports is 13.21 trillion yuan, down 3% from the same period last year.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports fell only 0.9% year-on-year, especially export growth by 2.9%.
Relevant experts believe that although there are signs of stability in July's import and export, there should not be too high expectations.
In July, the total value of China's imports and exports was 2.09 trillion yuan, down 0.9% year-on-year.
Among them, exports of 1.22 trillion yuan, an increase of 2.9%; imports of 873 billion yuan, a decline of 5.7%; trade surplus of 342.8 billion yuan, an increase of 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports continues to decline year-on-year, export data has increased, which is the fifth consecutive month since March.
Shanghai police rescued more than 3,400 people in four months to crack down on the "smuggling" gang of 157
At the same time as the investigation of the case, the police also recovered stolen money and looted items totalling more than 33 million yuan.
According to the allegations of members of the robber gang, they entered Shanghai from the field by packing a black car, and then went off each other's car after several hours, and left Shanghai together.
In the course of the case, suspects often use a building as a unit, using the outside wall to climb, and cracking the anti-theft window fence from top to bottom "sweep" theft.
Recently, the suspect has been transferred to Xuhui District Procuratorate for review and prosecution by the SXhui Public Security Branch.
Police remind the general public that when leaving, it is necessary to lock the door and window of the home, for the selection of anti-theft windows, it is recommended that the public should choose harder steel materials.
According to China's voice "News Night Peak", in late August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Kenya for the sixth African Development Conference.
The African Development Conference was spearheaded by Japan, and the five previous meetings were held in Tokyo or Yokohama, Japan, so this meeting will also be the first time to relocate to Africa.
Japan's foreign ministerial officials said in this regard that local meetings in Africa helped to raise the concerns of African and European countries about Japan.
In order to accompany the visit of Shinzo Abe, according to the common social news, the Japanese Self-Defense Party will send a delegation of parliamentarians to the countries concerned.
It's no coincidence that Japan's "inhabitable" path began in the early 1990s, while a Japanese-sponsored African Development Conference also started in 1993!
Africa, with 53 seats in the United Nations, is an important box office for the United Nations, and how can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to be "inhabitable"?
It will also exchange views with relevant nationals on the response of extremist organizations "Islamic State" and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japan's Foreign Ministry, Tian Wenxian, has recently made an indication of its intention at the United Nations Security Council regarding the African Development Conference.
Abe has announced that for the stability of sub-Saharan African countries, 100 billion yen (about 6.1 billion yuan) will be provided in five years.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity for Africa has long been aimed primarily at two purposes: first, to increase the sense of its presence in Africa; and secondly, to win support from African countries on the issue of habitualization.
Yang Burjiang, an expert on Japan's issues, said: "From a political point of view, although Africa is relatively lagging behind in development, but there are more countries, so Japan has always regarded it as the so-called "big ticket field".
Japan will not give up in the future, nor will work on Africa be terminated and will continue to strengthen.
On the economic side, because of Japan's relatively strong production capacity, domestic markets are relatively limited, especially in the context of child aging, domestic demand is relatively low.
However, from the springs of 10 years ago to Abe 10 years later, during which Japan has repeatedly launched a regular "sprint", but all go back.
Yang Burjiang, an expert on Japanese issues, believes that Japan's usual intention is clear, but the road to normal must be difficult.
To achieve its goals, Japan must first establish good relations with the surrounding countries, where it needs to have a correct attitude in both geopolitical and national disputes and historical awareness.

Traditional customs introduces new highlights of "2016 Hong Kong Cultural Festival" opening
The music of the gong drumming, traditional snacks, flowery decorations, and crowding scenes.
The 2016 Yellow Culture Festival, hosted by the Hong Kong Chaos Association General Assembly, was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14, the most prestigious one in Hong Kong.
In addition to continuing the existing "snatcher and loneliness competition", there is also an increase in the whole family's "parent basin for heaping base race".
Not only in the form of comics to introduce yolang culture history, there are also yolang theme 3D selfies area, traditional snack areas and traditional handicraft mobile classrooms, attracting a lot of children and foreign people to experience the visit.
A couple from France stayed for nearly three hours at the event scene and experienced a sweeping experience in mini-painted streaming classrooms.
"Checking this special holiday online, so decide to come and see it feels fresh."
They said that while France also has similar commemorative festivals, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, with music and food to learn traditional craftsmanship.
"Such a bustling financial metropolis in Hong Kong can also see such large, organized ceremonies to worship ancestors."
"This not only reflects the multiplicity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand and pass on these traditional crafts."
"We don't want to put the festival in a very horrifying way and make people afraid of approaching, especially children."
"We want to let young people know that through the activities and placements of youth on site, what we want to express behind Yulan culture is piety and gratitude."
He also said that a total of 24 teams took part in the "snatcher race", including not only associations, but also working with some schools to get students involved.
It is understood that the Hong Kong Chaos Festival in 2011 was included in the list of non-material cultural heritage at the national level.
On the evening of 11, China's National Beijing Theatre and famous drama "White Snake Passage" passed through a thousand miles to Mexico City, in the Meiji National Palace of Fine Arts presented a original Japanese theatrical feast for local people.
As a key performance project for the "Year of Cultural Exchange in Central and Latin America", from August 9-23, China's National Beijing Theatre performed seven plays in Mexico City as well as in five cities such as Cordoba, Huarez.

Marisa Hemennis Cajo, who had watched the play 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter to watch the show.
"This is a wonderful performance, music, lights and stage performances are all impressing me... I think it's very necessary to let my daughter know about Chinese culture and Chinese cinematography."
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience impressed the white woman's play and young actresses.
"I didn't think the Mexican audience was so enthusiastic that I had some concerns about how they could understand the story, but it was my surprise to see them today grasping the plot and many laughter points."
China's Ambassador to Mexico Chu Xiaoqi said that the cultural exchange activities of this year's "China-Latin America Cultural Exchange Year" have a positive role in promoting greater understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
Next year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Mexico, when more cultural exchanges will be held in both countries.
Liu Huigui went to the three-year study of "Double Changing, Double City" asking to improve the level of urban construction pipe
On the morning of 12th, Liu held a colloquium and listened to the report on the progress of the pilot work of "double repair" "double city" in Sanya City and the opinions and recommendations of all relevant departments.
Liu gave full recognition to the staged results and good experience and good practices created in the pilot work.
Liu Guangui stressed that Sanya should seize the historical development opportunities, using "double repair" and "double city" pilot work as an important catcher, in the economic and social development of the whole province to play a full demonstration lead role.
We should play a good lead role in improving the internationalization of international tourism islands, starting with small drops of details, enriching international elements and creating international boutiques.
It is necessary to play a good lead role in urban and rural integration and nationwide tourism, accelerate the construction of specialities and towns, integrate tourism elements into each project, and build every village and town in Sanya into tourist attractions.
We should play a good lead role in the "Hundred Days of Action for Social Investment in Services", promote a number of major projects and park construction, ensure the landing of high-quality projects, and implement the requirements of large actions.
Zhang Qi, Deputy Governor Wang Road, Provincial Committee Standing Committee and Sanya City Committee Secretary, participated in the research discussion.
During his 14-year career, Deng Yaping won 18 world championships and became the first person in China's Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She has maintained the world's first position for eight consecutive years, and is the longest-time female athlete in ping tennis history.
On September 26, 2010, he was deputy secretary-general of the People's Daily News and general manager of the People's Search Network Joint Stock Company.
Recently, she will team up with Yu Minhong to create the first domestic sports industry innovation and startup platform.
There is also such a group of star coaches on the Chinese sports field: they are inexhaustible in the age of athletes, won countless honors for the country; after retirement, they have taught them many years later and trained them to win the championship.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin chose to pick up his whip after retirement.
From the female team coach to the male team coach, and to the general coach, Huang Yubin created a "Olympic gold regiment", which also led the team to achieve 9 gold1 silver4 copper in the Beijing Olympic Games.
Since then, Tian Liang has been advertising advocates constantly, and in recent years he has played important roles such as "the oxen", "refing".
Many NBA players have proven their strength, but someone progresses and others decline.
Whether it's because of age gain or time constraints, some players are rebounding each season.
Of course, some "backbacks" may be just a shrinkage of data and the strength of these players may not have declined.
Even if Wade is still one of the best scorebacks in the league, his performance in bullies shouldn't have been so good.
He and Ronaldo have limited backfield shots, with home star Butler having a three-point score of only 32.8 percent, making their next season offensive very crowded.
Come to Wind City, Lightning Man is bound to give the ball more to Butler and Londo, who are likely to choose a dieting method in the regular season.
Okafoe's situation was more embarrassing, as the first choice for 76 people last season, he had to compete with Simmons and Enbyd in his new season.
This competition may not come soon, Simmons will also need to adapt to the NBA game and Nbide will be able to fully recover from injury as soon as possible, but whether Okafo has a position in the 76-strong Long Fens is still a problem.
Last season, Okafo's 32 percent score came from a low-end offensive, higher than Cousins, Vucevic and Brook Lopez, while his use was also high in the top 40 of the League.
As Simmons has demonstrated the excellent control forward acumen, and Engbyd also has a better fit for the NBA game, Okafo's position is unlikely to be as solid as ever.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's usage has stabilized in the top 20 of the League, which is also his best-selling two seasons.
But the problem is that with Durant's arrival, Thompson's use rate will certainly decline and this will inevitably affect his playback.
This impact will not only affect the number of shots, but Tang God's goal attack will certainly be greatly reduced next season, which in some ways will reduce opponents' defense difficulties against him.
Durant's arrival will surely bring the Warriors players down data, but one of the most serious downsizing is probably Thompson.
But that doesn't mean God's level retreats, it's more like he sacrificed for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better last season than the data reflected, not only because his basket efficiency came to its highest level in his career, but he and Aldrich's chemical reactions also benefited the Spurs.
Duncan retired, and Ginobili announced another year of war, the combination of GDP finally came to an end, as one of the youngest of three people, not much oil in the tank of a French sports car.
After getting the third championship ring, only Jabar, Jordan and Russell won more regular season MVPs than James, while Jordan was the only FMVP to win more than James.
Oh, yeah, James just brought Cleveland his first professional sports trophy in the last 52 years.
James, who came to his 14th season of career, needed better physical assurance and prepared for the playoffs.
As a result, in the regular season, James's data is likely to slip further and he will assign more weight to Owen, but he will still easily become the first three players in the league.
"The talents learned from the country must be unleashed in Russia."
On the 12th of local time, Huang Jing, Chairman of the Russian Federation of Chinese Diasporas in Moscow, said excitedly when he saw a reporter.
Shortly before, she attended the "Chinese Talent (Culture and Painting) Training Course in Overseas Chinese Cultural Associations hosted by the Aliens Office of the State Council of China and held by South University".
When he was just in the training course, he did not know exactly where to draw from, and as a result at the end of the training session, he could paint and write his own works.
After returning to Moscow, you must make your own contribution to the dissemination and promotion of Chinese culture using the knowledge and skills you have learned.
The same feeling was expressed by the Secretary-General of the Russian Chinese Culture Promotion Association, who also participated in this training course.
She said that she has made great progress with the help of training instructors, and also felt a heavy duty as a "Chinese cultural overseas communicator".
Nanwei said that after returning to Russia, he will spread and promote traditional Chinese culture among the Chinese and Russian people who love Chinese culture.

Earlier that day, the British team defeated South Africa by 7-5, which could have affected their status in the final.
But anyway, the current Fijian team is enough to beat a mentally full 15-man team.
"Tomorrow at least one Brit will wear a gold medal, which may be a consolation for the British team, but it may not be. This Englishman is Ben Ryan, Fiji coach from Wimbledon who has served as head coach of the British team.
The British team is hard to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's guidance, they did not win at the Adelaide International Seven-Man Rugby.
And now they're just a step away from the champions.
Although they have been hit immensely, they have also made remarkable progress.
Fiji's opening took precedence, leaving the British team with no leverage.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like crashing into a row of buses on the way. When Osie Corinnizo rushed into the corner flag area, the world series champion teams were already ahead with a score of 5-0.
Only four minutes later, Jerry Tuwei scored on the right-wing touch.
12-0, the British team hardly ever hit a ball.
Mitchell's forceful blocking of the giant general Lyon Nakarawa did not score a third, but it only slowed Fiji's scoring speed.
In 7 minutes, Yasa Verleimarou touched the right corner.17:0, England's team got worse.
Nakarawa scored another point, and the game... there was one minute left in the first half.
Then, Watmo Lavrov punched the British team's defenses straight to the score line.
At midfield rest, the score is already 29 to 0.
Fijians are as if they were born to play seven rugby, and the British team is still a primer.
That's the case.
The British team made a huge change in the second half and slammed the Fijian defense for four minutes, which was well done in the first half. But then the Fiji team played an excellent match with Joshua Tuesova again.
Dan Norton created an opportunity for the British team to score, and he changed his score to 36-7 on the left corner, but the game has long been in control of the South China Sea island countries, their fans chanting loudly at the stands, waving flags, and carrying songs.
The fantastic performance of the Fiji team was forced to snap hands quickly.
Matta William stopped a so-called attack on the Fiji team at the last moment.
The final whistle rang, the Fijians embraced together, and the defeated British team could only regret retreating.
Earlier that day, the Fiji team defeated Japan with 20-5 in the semifinals, while Britain was victorious against South Africa in a fierce semifinal match.
In the first half, Kyle Brown helped South Africa get ahead, but Dan Norton punched in the second half with excellent footwork.
Afterwards, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson secured the team's victory with a wonderful intercept and eventually England won silver.
Helen Graff and Heather Steining were inspired by cancer coaches to win the gold medal.
No exaggeration to say, this is the most touching gold card.
From the first paddle to now, Helen Graves and Heather Steining have received 220 punitive lifting trainings that they won in Estacio da Lagoa with a more remarkable meaning.
Although only two of them were slammed, the voice of another man on board - coach Robin Williams - was accompanied by their shock to a second consecutive female double-occupant Olympic gold medal, the first pair of women who reached this height.
They have maintained 39 unbeatable records with absolute advantages.
What we're seeing is that these two talented athletes are graciously forward on the surface of the water, but it's not all about this victory.
There are many people who volunteered to help behind each of the gold medals, and it is their continuous dedication that has created a difference, and none of them can help more than a coach who learned about his cancer 30 months ago and did not know whether he could live to see this day.
As he said, death may come at any time.
I got bladder cancer and they had surgery for me.
If you don't do surgery, the cancer cells spread throughout the body.
That way, the situation would be much worse.
This will slightly change your opinion.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he started treatment in early 2014, minimizing the impact, although it may not be appropriate to say so in this case.
I need to get my paycheck, so I have to hurry up.
This is an incentive for me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say it's enough to take a few steps, I still walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet every time around my ward.
That's the starting point for everything.
The boating movement itself is a journey, which makes this journey even longer.
At the moment of gold grabbing, they first thought about Williams. This morning's Williams was slightly more eloquent than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
Stanning, who was the head of the Royal Artillery Corps, will travel to Afghanistan afterward, she said: "My mood is bad this week and may be a bit extreme but that gold medal does make an extraordinary difference."
It has repeatedly told me how important this is for me and how much effort I, Helen and Robin have made.
This is Helen, Robin and I have worked hard for three years to recoup.
Without Robin, we were just a nameless sergeant and thanked him very much for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better trainer and coach than he did.
Helen Graff and Heather Steining have failed in five years.
The punitive force set by the combination is incomparable to their opponents.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began approaching, Stanning and Grave still had a lot of physical reserves.
It was amazement at the time.
Helen called: "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is indeed important not to be affected by the adversaries.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not look forward to what was amazing.
We didn't think about today's glory, we just thought of trimming each oar and winning this game, and we did it.
The combination took a year to determine its future.
Graff will be married to television explorer Steve Buckshar next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the present.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
This would put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I am the Olympic champion.
It's a whole new experience, and I feel very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
She said, "I feel better."

Bulgaria's inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1 per cent in July.
This was the highest inflation rate in a few years (since June 2012). After October last year, inflation reached zero for the first time.
Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014-July 2015), the average annual inflation rate for the past 12 months (August 2015-July 2016) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index for July 2016 was 101.0%, and the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
This year's inflation rate (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2%. Compared to July 2015, the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2%.
Compared to last month, prices for the following categories of consumer goods rose in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%) and other goods and services (0.3%).
Price declines include clothing and footwear (2.2 per cent), furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5 per cent) and medical care (0.1 per cent).
Compared to the price of last month, there are alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, natural gas and other fuels, communications, education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is referred to as an irony for Asians
Snapchat says the filter's inspiration for automasonry, but some observers believe it is racially coloured.
Snapchat's 150 million daily users can change reality through its filter tools and make people look funny.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
These lenses have the effect of passivation and bend characteristics, producing more than 30 million modified selfies per day.
Any missteps will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for encouraging black people to play or be beautiful with white skin.
So when the app provided a filter to some users this week that could create slant, quill and face effects, some critics called it racial irony for Asian "yellow seedlings."
They even thought whether these recurring issues meant that the company had bigger problems with diversity.
After Snapchat said it had removed the feature, Wednesday's report of The Verge and Motherboard sparked outrage.
The company's explanation is that the filter pays tribute to anime characters, not ironic Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of real-life damaging stereotypes.
Others are also strongly opposed to these anime images.
A Korean-American artist who tweeted about the photos and was widely shared said in an email that the filters were "at least distressing and uncomfortable."
She also said: "It is difficult to distinguish between the effects of extremely nauseous Asian irony images and filters."
Although the filter is not only yellow breeders, but yellow breeders are extremely depreciated.
Snapchat is not the only company that touches these cultural bottomlines.
From the company's board of directors to Hollywood and the devices we carry, American culture seems to have been advocating diversity and inclusion.
Snapchat's large youth group may be sensitive because it focuses more on racial pluralism than older generations.
When a Snapchat filter created an image of insulting users, 25-year-old Jucaiti said in an interview on Thursday: "Such things are more difficult to escape from people's eyes than before."
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and a telephone interview, she said that she believed the race-related controversy reflected Snapchat's lack of racial diversity during recruitment.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's employees for being mostly white, with the leadership full of men and adding a label at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said: "Either there are no people of all colours among their employees so they can make such decisions, or some colored people among their employees, but their positions cannot allow them to speak freely."
Other observers shared complaints she had not responded to by Snapchat.
The company did not publish data on the diversity of employees and said it was a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its employees on Thursday, but a spokeswoman said the company had recently hired a recruiter specifically to focus on people with lower internal proportions and promote in-house inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I want to know if they need more users who oppose this behavior like us."
Congressional panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released on Thursday, a congressional group noted that officials from the U.S. Central Command had changed their intelligence reports and would be described more optimistically in Iraq and Syria's war against ISIS than in fact.
The midterm report comes from a special working group formed by Republican chairs of the House Military Committee, Intelligence Committee and Defense subcommittee at the House Appropriations Committee. It reports that there is "widespread discontent" with CIA intelligence analysts who say superiors are tampering their assessment of the U.S. war with ISIS.
Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia region.
According to a news report on the report, "The intelligence audited by senior leaders at Central Command is more optimistic about the description of U.S. counterterrorism operations than they are and has always been more optimistic than other intelligence agencies' analysis."
The California Republican representative said: "The actions of the Central Command are unacceptable. On the one hand, our fighters suffer from war and on the other, high-level policymakers receive misanalysis."
The leadership issue of the Central Command has been extended to the highest level of the agency.
The report details the long-standing problems of 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. training for Iraqi troops.
While there is no definitive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration have ordered changes to those reports, according to the report, these analysts feel pressured by central command leaders to make their views more optimistic about the threat of Islamic State (ISIS or ISIL).
"In the first half of 2015, many central command press releases, statements and congressional testimony were much more optimistic than actually."
For example, a Central Command official has publicly said it may have taken a major military action to recapture Mosul as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement: "After months of investigation, this result has been very clear."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials at the U.S. Central Command were in charge of their intelligence products and concealed the threat from Islamic State Iraq.
After the Republicans learned from analysts that intelligence about ISIS was being manipulated, they set up a special working group.
As the investigation continues, there will be more findings following the report released on Thursday.
The Attorney General of the Ministry of Defense has also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings on Thursday, aligned with some of the conclusions of a Republican task force.
In a statement, Xi'anda, the Democratic leader of the Commission, said: "From 2014 to 2015, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments by ISIS and Iraqi peacekeeping forces."
Mr. Sheanda said the process "obstructs the release of intelligence," reduces the morale of analysts, and "cannot accept different opinions."
But Mr. Sheanda and the Democrats also said they had found no evidence to show that the White House tried to exert pressure on analysts at Central Command, so their conclusions were consistent with "preconceived or political narratives."
The Beast Daily reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that after receiving a complaint from the Central Command analyst, the Pentagon's attorney general started investigating.
Pentagon spokeswoman Major-General Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department did not comment on the congressional report until the investigation by the Attorney General was completed.
"Experts sometimes diverged in the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense encouraged a healthy dialogue on these important national security themes."
The impact of the investigation has surpassed the question of whether U.S.-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been successful (as more and more Defense Department officials claim).
But last year, those claims raised public questions about how much President Obama can trust the CIA's military assessments of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of more than a decade ago's controversy, when the CIA intelligence analyst Gregory Hook wrote a research article in which he pointed out that George W. Bush's government insisted on sending small troops to Iraq despite many analysts' objections and did little to consider what happened after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hook has played a key role in the campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Hook's team concluded that airstrikes against ISIS refineries did not significantly reduce the economic income of a terrorist organization as it built temporary refineries and continued to sell oil on the black market, which is in stark contrast to the announced statement.
According to Times Weekly's report in September, the Central Command did not publicize this discovery.
When a number of lawyers reviewed Senate testimony about overly optimistic assessments of the war, Central Command commander Lloyd Austen III was criticized last year.
General Austin retired in April and is currently replaced by Joseph Walter as his position at the Central Command.
The United States won four consecutive wins in the women's hockey game, and will be defeated with England.
Katie Bam, who won 6-1 against Japan, took the lead in a two-time win for U.S. women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the United States to beat India by 3-0.
Two games, five-point goals were fantastic but 27-year-old Bam said she didn't know she was doing so well.
She said, "I don't know anything about it."
I'm not the kind of person who remembers having scored several goals.
What she knows is that the U.S. team has won four consecutive games at the Olympics and will compete with the group's unbeaten British team after 2-0 defeating Japan on Thursday.
Britain and the United States met narrowly in Saturday's first round of final game.
Both teams were promoted to the quarterfinals, which will determine who would appear as group 1.
Teams that get the first team will avoid encountering a strong Dutch team, thus making it possible to go even further.
In Saturday's games, the U.S. team created a miracle with amazing performance. To know that at the London Olympics four years ago, the U.S. team laid down in 12 teams.
Bam was also in that team at the time.
Bam grew up in Brubel, Pennsylvania, picking up a hockey stick for the first time at age three (her twin sister was engaged in this sport at Drakesell) and joining the national team at age 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because of her failure to be included in the final list.
In 2012, she and her teammates weren't treated well.
The following year, British coach Craig Panam became the head coach and everything began to change.
"This is a cultural, mental and material change."
We weren't at the current level in London.
We have come to a complete reincarnation.
On Thursday night, Bam kicked off the headset with a close hand shot in the first half.
India hasn't won the game yet, but this team showed an amazing tenacity and kept a score of 1 to 0 until the end of season three, when Bam broke out.
She took the ball along the left side of the stadium long way, then cut into the middle road, shot in the net, and the U.S. team 2-0 ahead.
Melissa Gonzalez shot the final ball in mid-section IV.
The United States for the first time in this game against goalkeeper Jackie Brigis, each playing a ball in the previous three wins.
This time she played superordinarily.
Bam, too.
"We're in good shape now," Parnam said, but how well it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's match.
Cold acidic foods during the Great Depression
In March 1933, Franklin Drano Roosevelt, who was just elected president, sat in the presidential office for lunch.
As a gastrointestinal, President Roosevelt likes Fifth Avenue foods such as goose liver sauce and Maryland stew fish.
On that day, his menu was very simple: tomato sauce devil eggs, potato mud and as a pinch of fruit pudding.
Jen Zigman said: "It is for the sake of co-opting with those who are suffering in food."
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It also reflects the way Americans eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Mr. Coe's last book, The Frying Cakes, is about U.S. meals, and Ms. Zigman tells the lives of slum tenants through food in her book, Orchard 97.
Their co-authored new book, The Big Foods, will be published on Tuesday by Harper Press, which describes the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After showing some common insights on food, they met a reporter at Eisenberg's sandwich shop. The simple lunch counter in the ironing area has been operating to this day since the economic meltdown of 1929.
Ms. Zigman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with broken olive sandwiches while Mr. Coe, 57, placed an turkey, potato mud and vegetable plywood.
The reporter pointed out a baked meat roll, which the couple considered suitable for discussing diet during the Great Depression.
Ms. Zigman said: "Bread was very popular at the time."
There were peanut bread, liver bread and soy bread.
They are made of a raw material and a cheap watering head that can be poured on the raw materials.
Imagine that your dinner is peanuts.
Mr. Ko dressed as a freak.
He said, "They're certainly like lead in your stomach."
In the years before the Great Depression, American Tonton was a buffet, especially in suburban areas.
A group of women were cooking for male farm workers, and the pie had just been picked up for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
In World War I, it was Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans. The Great Food chronicled how this country suddenly ceased to be a rich place.
Mr. Ko explained why he and his wife were writing this book: "Food has become a major topic that makes Americans feel unhappy at the time."
Another unpleasant topic is the new food of chilly acid: "favorite foods" such as bread and steaks have become staples, with steaks being "the best remaining way to cook," said Ms. Zigman, because chefs can cover unpalatable ingredients with cream from their sauces.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat that has been the mainstay of the American table for many years has become a rare luxury.
The strange gadget only considers calories, and people first consider nutrition than taste or even basic cooking common sense.
During the study of this book, including various recipes, Ms. Zigman made a roasted onion filled with peanut oil.
Mr. Ko said, "This is not common at the dinner table."
Ms. Zigman said: "It's too strange."
Peanut oil and roasted onions cannot be matched at all.
This is a feature of many family-friendly meals.
Family economists have influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as head chef at the Federal Bureau of Family Economics from 1923 to 1943, which has been unique in history.
They publish recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "fine their calculus" and courageously turn bad foods such as creamy Italian with carrots into food.
"A great meal" is a rich 'historic taste'.
Particularly interesting is the government's response to hungry people, such as President-elect Herbert Hoover's attitude that "I can't handle other people's affairs."
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouses of childhood, his diet was refined as a millionaire.
Mr. Ko said: "He likes European Western food, such as fish-cooked sauce."
He wore an evening dress and ate in a gold-plated restaurant.
Clearly, he was disconnected from the people.
If it wasn't for his wife Elino to encourage him to set an example on diet, President Roosevelt might also make the same mistake.
As the book says, Ms. Roosevelt's butler hired was uninterested in taste, so "food is not only the hardest food in Washington, but also the worst food to cook."
When the United States returned to formality, many cooking styles during the Great Depression were discarded.
Ms. Zigman said that what remains is our focus on calories and nutrition as well as the application of science to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they further learned about Ms. Zigman's mother's eating habits, such as how she didn't discard food.
Mr. Co said: "She's very afraid of wasting food."
Ms. Zigman recalled: "She actually made many people sick."
For example, there has been a "smelling bubble" incident.
After removing the plates, she and Mr. Co took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this was President Roosevelt's pudding for lunch.
Ms. Zigman said, "This is called a creamy broth," and added that the new name for an ordinary dish was "habitual tricks."
There is no cream in this dessert, only fruit, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
It is difficult for everyone to penetrate the soaked brown paste.
Unsurprisingly, the taste of this dessert is good.
Mr. Coe ate another second and third spoon.
He felt it was an acceptable affordable dessert, and told his wife: "Adding a bit of walnut would be better to eat."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, with Saudi Arabia reaching a new high.
The report's non-prohibitive market cast doubt on OPEC's credibility, and the path to oil price recovery is feared to remain buoyant.
On Monday, OPEC Chairman-in-Office and Qatar Energy Minister Sada said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The OPEC's monthly report on Wednesday showed that output from the entire OPEC organization, including Gabon, rose by 46,000 barrels per day in July to 33.11 million barrels per day.
The OPEC also said in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has prompted global refiners to produce more refined petroleum products, thus exacerbating market oversupply.
Affected by this news, coupled with the U.S. increase in crude production and an unintended increase in crude inventories, international oil prices have declined for two consecutive days.
As of Wednesday's closing, the New York Commodity Exchange delivered light crude futures prices in September fell by 2.48%, and the London Brent oil futures sold in October fell by 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of producers is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the U.S. Energy Information Agency also pressures market popularity.
Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iranian oil minister Zangane on Wednesday saying Iran's daily crude output was up to 3.85 million barrels, the highest level since 2008.
As soon as the meeting came to light, Russian Energy Minister Novak said there was no need for a new round of freeze-free production negotiations at current oil prices.
The last meeting of the oil-producing countries has been in April, and OPEC member states have failed to reach agreement on any measures.
Imma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMIResearch, said markets and the media may be overreacting to OPEC's upcoming meetings.
Helima Croft, director of commodity strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC changed the mood in the market by releasing signals that they would make a deal.
This means like a smog and mirror that opens the eye (intentionally creating false impressions).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at German commercial banks, said the possibility that OPEC would try to stabilise markets through its September meeting was low.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, this organization has played a "wolf coming."
Everywhere, medical institutions that have been subject to multiple penalties should focus on the publication of non-compliant medical advertisements, centralized complaints and reports.
The National Health Planning Commission and the National Administration of Medicinal Medicine will organize in due course inspections on specific supervision and inspection work carried out in some provinces.
According to the media, due to the large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, which caused the current problem of product homogenization, the investment boom gradually retreated, and the capital entered the waiting period.
According to data from the Management Research Center of Ellipse Hospital in Hong Kong, a large number of Internet medical companies have died during the first year of their venture, and about 20% of start-ups are no longer available.
However, just as most Internet healthcare companies struggle to finance rounds A or B, several subdivided leading enterprises still have access to capital.
It seems that Internet medical entrepreneurship can not break "a bee", but to take into account the market demand, diligently and deeply.
Fishing jumped 12 million yuan, accounting for 40% of registered capital, and Kyuzhou Tong Equipment Corporation financed 18 million yuan, accounting for 60% of registered capital.
In recent years, with the national policy support in medical informationization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
This cooperation with Kyushu Tong is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals build an advanced supply chain management system, and this is an opportunity to seek more cooperation.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby has initially focused on the verticals of internet obstetrics, deeply practising both mother and doctor.
Not only can the mother receive free 24-hour and one-on-one referrals from a competent doctor, but she can also pay for targeted medical consultations.
At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical limits by taking the form of organizing experts to conduct online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions and other micro lectures for grassroots doctors.
Currently, there are three sections on the doctor's side: Doctors continue to educate, Doctors socializing and Doctors seeking help.
Provide services that include online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social platforms with hospitals, clinicians, legal aid, entrepreneurship support and other services needed for medical relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali's health is "willing to sink heart" to take big data on health.
The lack of professionalism in Internet and data companies does not achieve uniformity in the writing methods on the same article.
Ali's current layout in the field of medical health is divided into three blocks, namely Ali Health, Tian Cat Pharma and Alipay Future Hospital.
Wang Lei frankly said that medical and health entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "this is not only a matter of how much money, but also sink to heart, endure loneliness and slowly do it."
Staying up late watching the Olympic Games is easy to injure the heart.
The Brazilian Olympic Games are in full swing, and even if the event is aired at midnight in the country, many citizens will stay up late to watch.
In this regard, doctors especially remind that staying up late to watch the event has health risks, which can trigger cardiovascular diseases.
If you stay up late for a long time, the hormone will still be secreted in large quantities, and the human body will continue to be in a state of tension and excitement, unable to get normal recovery, which can cause vascular contraction, increase blood pressure, thus causing cardiovascular diseases.
Han Zhiyuan especially reminded that groups with high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high hemolipids, smoking habits, family history and other cardiovascular risk factors, if staying up late, can be more likely to cause cardiovascular diseases.
If you stay up late for a long time, not only cardiovascular function is affected, but also gastrointestinal function, immune system, neuroendocrine system will be affected, and even the risk of developing tumors will increase.
For elderly friends, Han Zhilong suggested that try not to stay up late for watching the Olympic Games, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last "World Cup" football match, Han Chiang had been interviewed with a 60-year-old patient whose heart muscle infarction caused or was associated with staying up late watching the game.
Han Zhiyuan said that since this year, his department has received some patients with cardiomyocardial infarction or brain stroke about 25 years old, which is largely due to the patient's long-term staying late lifestyle.
Do not stay up late every day, occasionally stay up late to watch your favorite sports projects, and other projects may want to wait for the next day to see the replay of the event.
2. When you stay up late to replenish moisture, eat more fruit, can prevent blood vessel blockage and enhance the body's immunity.

The film is expected to be premiered on Central Television and Video at the beginning of next year, and will also debut for the first time in VR panorama.
The documentary "The Polar" is a large work focusing on the third polar Tibetan plateau of the Earth, which tells a new perspective about Tibet's traditional and modern fusion and interaction between Tibet and the world.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union carried missiles into Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The incident was seen as the culmination of the Cold War, known as the "Cuba Missile Crisis".
Little is known, however, that during the Cold War a strong solar storm had fraught with an American nuclear war on the Soviet Union, which was not first published by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a strong solar storm caused intense interference with the radar and radio communications of the U.S. military in the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. military personnel who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity from then on, and examined non-confidential literature.
In the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from suddenly unleashing a nuclear war, some of the U.S. Air Force fighter jets carrying nuclear warheads flew into the sky.
The U.S. military commander, unaware that the culprit of this interference was the solar storm rather than the Soviet Union, ordered the aircraft to enter combat readiness.
Fortunately, the solar activity that the U.S. military began in the late 1950s and its research on electromagnetic interference with Earth eventually prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the Air Force Aviation Weather Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of this solar storm is that the U.S. military has since considered space weather as a combat concern and built a more robust space weather forecasting system.
In everyday travel, citizens find that the car is hindered by a strange vehicle, and in the absence of contact with an unknown vehicle driver, it can be used to solve this problem using the "WeChat navigator" function.

On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly published a new edition of the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines in New York, allowing Japanese armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This was the day when U.S. Secretary of Defense Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japan's Foreign Secretary Xietian Wenxong and Japanese Defence Secretary Zhong Guoyuan attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth publication of the Japanese military assessment report by China's civil think tank, and also the fourth edition in English.
The report is divided into 9 chapters, including general policy adjustment, military strength, defense budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional development reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, military security relations with China.
The report said 2015 was a phased year for Abe's government to advance major policy adjustments in the security sector for several consecutive years.
Since then, Japan's initiatives in the field of security will focus on operational aspects such as rule of law application, strategic implementation and policy implementation, rather than significant adjustments and changes to frameworks, mechanisms and policies.
The report emphasizes that the Abe Cabinet has tried to break through the above three points, reaching multiple goals to promote Japan's "normal nationalization", self-defense forces come out and intervene in international security affairs, strengthen the Japanese-American alliance, and protect against China.
Prior to this, China's Strategic Culture Promotion Conference published a Japanese military assessment report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014 and June 30, 2015.

The residence is grey and guarded with a perimeter fence, second inner wall, piercing barbed wires and vehicle barriers.
Short boards for public sports facilities
The black-hot coal farm warehouse turned into a "green grass" football field; the red brick scattered factory became a modern sports hall.
On National Fitness Day, the South Horse Camp Sports and Culture Park outside Changjiang Gate, Hangzhou, unveils a mysterious veil.
It used to be a coal farm, which has been idle since the shutdown more than a decade ago, leaving a lot of illegal construction and living garbage.
After the renovation, it became a sports culture park and will be officially opened to the public in November, providing free sports venues for citizens, and undoubtedly opens up new fertile ground for all sports.
This can not help reminding of Hangzhou Chen Yilong Medical School, this Chinese swimmer's "Wangpu military school" has sailed through several world champions.
The name of the swimming ball will be constantly produced, vividly interpreting the relationship between competitive sports and universal sports - a rich mass base provides good conditions for selecting professional players.
The level of athletics is closely related to the foundation of universal sports, which in a certain sense depends on universal sports, and universal sport depends on the conditions of the venue.
As of 2015, China's per capita stadium area has been 150 times larger than when New China was founded, but it is still far behind sports powerhouses.
In June this year, the State Council issued the National Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which focused on the development of mass sports.
In order to replenish this shortboard, on the one hand, the relevant departments should fully take into account the layout of the stadium when conducting urban planning.
On the other hand, established public stadiums, including sports venues in units such as schools, should maximize their openness and make use of them as efficient as possible.
The Rio Olympics, which is currently underway, inspires people's enthusiasm for sports and awakens everyone's awareness of participation.
Gilead gets attorney's fees in battle with Merck's hepatitis C patent
According to a U.S. District Judge's decision, Gilliard Science Corporation has the right to receive legal fees arising from patent litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck Group in the United States.
In June, after a U.S. judge discovered that Merck had committed an offence, including falsification and other immoral acts, Gerald was exempted from paying $200 million in compensation for the breach of two patents by Gilead's best-selling medicines Sofibwe and Havoni.
In a suit on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Lamberson Freeman said Gilead didn't have to bear the costs of defending him.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilde, who dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs market. Gilead's medicines can heal more than 90% of patients with hepatitis.
The case was first traced back to 2013, when Gilliard and Merck prosecuted each other, both claiming to be the owner of an effective ingredient in Gilliard's drug - Sophibwe's laboratory work.
U.S.-backed forces announced they had taken back Manbij from ISIS
The force spokeswoman said on Friday that the remaining ISIS soldiers in the city have all left and U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border.
Following the departure of militants hiding inside the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping the entire city.
Sarah Dalvis told Reuters that they have rescued more than 2,000 civilians hijacked by militants.
"Manbij is now under our control, but we are still sweeping."
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax of 34.2%.
Hillary Clinton released its 2105 tax return on Friday, showing the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earning $10.75 million in 2015 and paying a federal tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons' charitable donations amounted to $1 million, most of which were donated to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton spent nearly $5.3 million on speeches while the former Secretary of State earned $3 million from publisher Simon and Schuester with a book about her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's campaign partner, Senator Tim Kane of Virginia and his wife Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
The two men paid 20.3% of the federal tax in 2015.
Clinton's campaign aide, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane will continue to be benchmarks for financial transparency."
In stark contrast, Donald Trump masked and retracted his previous pledges to publish tax returns on false grounds.
While the law does not require, according to custom, presidential candidates should publicize their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted that you were your boss and attached the tax return link to Democratic candidates.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns before the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to publish tax returns would raise questions about his net worth of capital, charitable contributions, business deals and a variety of other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton lashed out at the issue, releasing a web video on Friday highlighting high-profile Democrats urging Trump to publicize his tax pay.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in an economic policy speech in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "For decades he has refused to publish his tax returns like other presidential candidates."
According to Politicians News, Trump had barely paid a penny tax for two years in the 1990s, and New York Times commercial columnists cited several tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, all of whom said it could still be.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a rule in the name of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which guarantees that people who earn more than $1 million annually pay at least 30 percent of their taxes.
President Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway's company is based, at which Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also being audited by the IRS and that Trump's "fearing" is not tax authorities, but voters.
The earliest tax returns issued by the Clinton campaign group were 2007.
The Clintons who currently live in Chabak, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, their wage earners are only $100.
Their main investment is the low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons' dividend and interest income is $109,000.

Jewish filmmakers criticize Berlin hotel to delete Israeli phone code according to Arab customers' "request"
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent told the media that the Berlin-based Kempinski Hotel did not list Israeli phone codes, and hotel staff said it was in accordance with Arab customers' "requirements", which sparked a public uproar.
Claude Lundzman, author of the Holocaust documentary "Hurricane", expressed his disappointment at Kempinski's hotel and published an open letter in Germany's Frankfurt Report.
During his recent stay, Langzman wanted to find Israel on the hotel's list of phone codes.
But Israel is not among the countries where guests can call directly from the room.
Israel disappeared in Germany's capital Berlin in 2016.
Langsman wrote.
Instead, guests can call Israel via the Call Center at Kempinski Hotel.
In search of explanation, the filmmaker asked about the hotel's front desk.
In his letter, Langzman said that the answer he received at the front desk "was shocking to him."
The hotel staff said it was "a deliberate decision taken by the Kempinski Hotel Management".
The reason for this is to irritate the filmmaker.
Lunzman cites the employee's words: "Most of our guests are Arabs who ask to delete Israeli code."
According to the South German Daily, Israel's Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadass Hamdelsman called it "a shameful humiliation."
We were surprised to learn about this incident.
This is a huge disgrace in itself.
It is even more disgraceful to see what happens in Germany and the hotel chain.
There is no need for any explanation.
"We hope the hotel can come to the right conclusion," the official said.
This incident has sparked heated debate online, and everyone thinks it's a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel is simply "subdued" to meet Arab customers' demands.
Another post pointed to the hotel's "True Face," and noted that the street in the famous Kuddam Avenue was near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming that everything was "inadvertent" and saying "apologies" to Lunzman.
The South German Daily quoted Kempinski as saying: "There has never been a direct order to remove Israel from the fast dial list."
The newspaper also said that the Israeli code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, students clashed with police as they protested the reform of the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to evict protesters.
The incident was caused by law enforcement officials trying to disperse students, so the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with these programs.
To save money, St. Paul's Governor Oakming plans to close 100 public schools and relocate 300,000 students.
Some protesting students expressed dissatisfaction with interim President Michel Temer through graffiti on the wall.
Just days before a recent protest took place, protesters collectively marched to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, impeached by the National Senate.
Scotch cyclist Carlm Skinner won the gold medal after relegating
Scottish cyclist Carlm Skinner last night competed at the Rio Bicycle Race to help the British Trio team successfully defend the Olympic gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriots, Sir Chris Hoey, and became the centerpiece of the team. Even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the young Skinner defeated the winning New Zealand team and regained its reputation.
Four years ago, the British team slammed and Hoey won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
The British team was only sixth in the March World Bicycle Field Championships in London, and Hoy has since retired.
During the Beijing to London Olympics, the British team's problem was to replace "first circle expert" Jamie Staeff.
The team did this exactly when Sindes appeared.
Hoey's retirement also left a blank, and both Chien Imadi and Matt Crampton wanted to fill it.
After seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaching group insisted that he be included in the national team, and Skinner did not end up losing hope.
Skinner's partner is Sindes and Kenny, who won gold with Hoy four years ago. The three men refreshed the Olympic record in the qualifying round, but this score was surpassed by New Zealanders in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually defeated their opponents and won gold medals.
While Sindes is slightly behind, Kenny leads the team and Skinner keeps this lead to the end.
Changes in strategy were key to this reversal, and Sindes chose larger flywheels so the speed was slower, which allowed Kenny, especially Skinner, to keep pace.
Hoy watched the game as a BBC commentator. Skinner, Kenny and Sindes saw him on the podium.
23-year-old Glasgow biker Skinner said, "This is a surprise to me."
I'm just doing my best to make myself famous.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and beat the world champion.
It's so incredible.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoey at the 2012 London Olympics, Sindes admitted to deliberately falling on the track in a bad start.
He later retracted the comment, and opponents of the British team were unable to appeal.
This victory has no such problems.
Sindes said: "It's like in London, where all the British flags are on the platform."
We just teamed up three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world championships, so being able to defend the Olympic champion is too surprising.
This is only a game and a gold medal for the British team, who won seven of the 10 venues at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this symbolizes the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to succeed in the bike park for the next five days.
According to Kenny's state, he was not unable to recreate the feat of having won three gold medals at one Olympic Games.
If so, 12 years younger than Hoy and also on March 23 (this day appears to be the sacred day of British sports, as was Steve Redgrave, Mo Fara and Roger Bannister) born Kenny will have six gold and one silver cards.
This achievement is similar to that of Hoy.
Kenny's next fight will begin today, a three-day race speed.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: "I'm going to focus on this game for a while.
Teams are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, a person wins a bit alone.
Sindes said: "If he can win two other gold medals, then he should be awarded a jazz seal."
It was the only match that day to produce medals, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Cransey, Steven Burke and Owen Dure promoted the four-to-four-kilometre group chasing with the fastest results.
Their score was 351.943.
The world record for gold medalists at the 2012 London Olympics was 351.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) held on the second game day, Wiggins will undoubtedly become a focus of attention.
Yesterday he had a quarrel with the race officer before qualifying, when the race officer asked him to measure his height.
In the women's group race that will end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roselle Chande, Elino Buck and Kate Archibald from Milgey are promoted to a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied heavily on its stadium bikers to take the initiative during the mid-Olympic and garner multiple medals.
After demonstrating their absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British Cycling Team was slightly disappointed in its journey to Rio.
A number of turbulences occurred during the period, including the resignation of technical director Sean Sutton on charges of gender discrimination and bullying in April as well as the retirement of legends such as Hoey, Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night of the Cycling Hall is enough to prove that the British team will re-enter a legendary critical moment when it reaches its peak.
After the little life comes to this world, dads and moms are responsible for this life, which is not only in the child's physical health, but also in spiritual development, that is education.
If the education of children fails, even if the career succeeds, it cannot compensate for the lack of life and family failure.
When a new life comes, parents and grandparents need to spend their time caring for and educating children.
Responsibility, in addition to embodied in the maintenance of the body, their health, is also in spiritual education, that is, let the child learn how to be human, how to become adult, and how to succeed.
Good family education means that parents need to accompany the child regularly, give care to the child, patient care, and also teach the child to cultivate a civilized speech and behavior, so that the child learns better knowledge, improves intelligence.
One word or another of the parents will affect the growth of the child, they will imitate their parents, that is, people often say dragons, phoenix and phoenix, the son of a mouse will knock holes, what parents like children.
Therefore, parents need to be a good example in front of the child, regulate their own words and deeds, cultivate their own excellent character, which can indirectly help the child to form a good mentality, make him better.
Emily is a smart and beautiful girl.
She is particularly lively, can be well with friends, and the adaptability to the environment is also good.
But Amy has a little secret in her heart: she can't focus on the learning, job tasks that she is going to do for a long time.
This secret has been with Amy for a long time. The usual problem is not serious."
Even through a dispersed, modular time to learn and work, she can basically complete tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task is heavy and time-consuming, Amy feels very painful and tortured.
The individual's resistance to self-exposure and its emotional experience is aimed at preventing the individual's self-awareness and self-esteem from being threatened.
Some behavioral psychologists also understand obstruction as an individual's disobedience to correcting his behavior.
I tried to get Amy to do an exercise, let her calm herself by relaxing her breath and feel the pain.
Once she left the trapped situation, she felt herself relaxed and regained freedom.

Uber's four-year entry into the Taiwanese market has had no small impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
Taiwan's Joint News Agency reported on August 12 that more than a hundred taxis bypassed the Taiwan "Administrative Chamber" in protest on the morning of 12, leading to serious traffic paralysis.
Zhang Lijia, chairman of the Taipei City Drivers' Union, said that Uber had come to Taiwan for four years before the authorities met at the end of this month and drivers could no longer wait.
However, the government is unfaithful and repeatedly dragged.
Law-abiding taxi drivers belonging to the bottom of the labor force, who compete against illegal but unrestricted Uber, feel deceived by the authorities.
Original title: 2,000 chickens at a Jiangsu farm were arrested by the court and sold illegally

The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development and Reform Commission said today that excess steel production capacity is a global problem.
China's capacity utilization rate in recent years has been higher than the global average, and is also higher than other countries and regions such as the United States and Europe.
China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the effectiveness is gradually manifested.
The head of state pointed out that the Party Central Committee and State Council attach great importance to the global problem of overcapacity in steel production.
The departments and regions actively follow up the implementation of the deployment of the State Council, and seriously work to reduce the production capacity of rough steel by about 45 million tons this year.
From the point of view of our country, China does not encourage steel exports, but instead has taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The head of the company stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market behavior, and it is independent choice based on the needs of importing countries and consumers' comprehensive consideration of product cost-effectiveness factors.
Implementation of trade protection measures does not help to fundamentally solve the development problems of the global steel industry, on the contrary, will only cause further shocks to the international trade order.
When it came to debt, the head of state stressed that desolation is an important issue which needs to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large size of the assets of steel enterprises, involving a wide range, some enterprises' debt relations are complex, and if improper disposal can lead to regional risks.
According to the head of the department, in recent years, with the economic downturn pressure increased, total social demand gradually weakened, some industry capacity utilization rate decreased, and enterprise production and business difficulties increased.
Some enterprises do not adapt to the changes in the market environment, production and business is difficult to succeed or even near collapse, but are constrained by some institutional mechanisms factors, more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way, become "Zombie Enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts the market signal, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a fair competitive market environment.
The main reason for the loss is similar to the dilemma facing the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanism, economic means and rule of law approach, the government mainly does good work for employees' bottom line and social stability, to ensure a fair and just market order.
The head of the department stressed that the next step is to continue unswervingly to catch up with production capacity work and ensure completion of the target task of 100-150 million tons of crude steel production in five years.
On the afternoon of 10, when the Chinese tourist police unveiled in Moscow's Red Square, they immediately caught people's attention, Chinese tourists waved with surprise and locals and foreign tourists could not help but wait.
On the same day, members of China's first professional tourist police force - Sanya City Public Security Bureau in Hainan Province - arrived at Moscow Red Square and exchanged their experience with local tourism police.
Moscow's tourism police are divided into three group patrols in the Red Square, Nicolyski Path Street and Gumm department store. The entire process has lasted for more than an hour.
She was in her 20s and knew English and Spanish, when she joined the tourist police last year.
He looked closely at the words and deeds of his Russian counterparts along the way, and exchanged with her from time to time.
When they met Spanish tourists to consult, the Moscow Tourist Police used fluent Spanish to patiently explain each other, which impressed Wang Ice.
"Everyone in the Moscow Tourist Police has a foreign language, and there are more than two, which touches us very much."
"As an international tourist island, Hainan is gradually focusing on attracting international tourists and we want to improve our ability to match the status of the international tourism island."
Before studying in the same day, China's tourism police also visited the Moscow City tourist police station and exchanged with their Russian counterparts.
"I often deal with Chinese tourists and I am very happy to see them coming to Russia."
"The questions they usually ask for help are: how to walk, where a monument is located, how to rent and how to return to the hotel."
The captain of the Moscow City Tourism Police team, Rezakov, said that in recent years the city environment and tourism atmosphere in Moscow have become better and more attractive to foreign tourists.
In order to adapt to the needs of tourism development, a tourist police force was established in July 2014, which is responsible for patrolling and protecting various major attractions, helping and guiding tourists.
At present, all the Moscow tourist police are proficient in English, and some also speak Spanish and German.
The police force divides them into nine groups based on the level of foreign languages, and takes two classes a week to learn self-defense pronunciations, legal regulations and foreign languages.
"There are currently two travel police officers starting to learn Chinese, and we're going to continue to improve their Chinese level," Rezakov said.
Rezakov told reporters that since the formation of the Moscow Tourist Police has accumulated some experience, hoping to inspire the three-party.
He believes that cooperation between the Russian and Chinese police departments will enhance the security of their citizens to travel to each other's countries.
"The staffing, police model, equipment and good interaction with tourists in Moscow have given us a lot of inspiration," Chen Xiaoquan said.
At present at least nine provinces and cities such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing have issued residency permits.
For the conditions of applying for a residence permit, the above areas are generally proposed that you need to reside for more than half a year, and meet one of the conditions with legal stable employment, lawful stable residence, continuous reading.
In terms of the treatment provided by residency permits, there is a different amount of "gold content" everywhere, and the scope of public services and amenities offered in some areas has expanded compared to the provisions of the national version.
These areas have increased the convenience of children to participate in local high-level examinations, subject to relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and many other places have explicitly demanded that the scope of providing public services and amenities be gradually broadened and regularly published to society.
For example, Fujian proposed that at least every three years the scope of public services and amenities enjoyed by holders of a residence permit should be disclosed to society.
The Provisional Regulations on Residence Permit stipulate that, if the conditions of residence permit processing are met, public security organs shall produce and issue a residence permit within 15 days from the date of acceptance.
For the time frame for issuing a certificate, most regions agree with the national version, which is issued within 15 days.
Hebei is clear that the public security police station of the place of residence shall issue a residence permit within 3 working days from the date of admission.
Jiangxi stipulates that, in accordance with the requirements for obtaining a residence permit and complete documentation, the public security organs shall produce and issue a residence permit within five working days from the date of acceptance.
In accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits, all of these areas are clear that they apply for a residence permit for the first time and will be exempted from the cost of paperwork.
For example, Sichuan requires that local public security police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly implement the approved charging projects and fees standards, and firmly prohibit super-range, ultra-standard charges or ride-hailing.
On July 27, 2016, Chen Yangxia, the former county committee secretary of Dannan County Committee in Ganzhou City, reported to the provincial board for work as director of the party wind and wind supervision department (at the deputy head level, a trial period of one year).

As the 2014 first round of No. 12, Saric will officially land on the NBA next season and join the Philadelphia 76 team.
As a young European player, many fans don't know him very well, but through the 2015 Olympics, I believe Saric's performance has left a deep impression on people.
Last Croatian victory over Spain, Saric successfully sealed Paul-Gasol at the last moment in an attempt to drag the game into a timed basket of offensives.
Recently, 76 team manager Bret-Bron gave Saric a high rating, which the Spurs coach believed he saw the shadows of Manu-Ginobili when he was young.
Clearly, Saric has shown his talents and made 76 people look forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games at the Olympic Games, Saric received a total of 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric demonstrated his ability to unlock space on the field and shot him out of three lines after he was knocked off with his teammates.
While the 76-strong inner line is currently hoarding many talented young players, they don't have Sarridge's outer capabilities.
From capping to launching a long-running fast attack and completing the assist, today's NBA games can achieve this number of insiders.
Since the beginning of this Olympic Games, Saric has received 13 points, eight rebounds and five assists in three games, making it a comprehensive performance.
Since his decision to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two consecutive 1+1 contracts.
As the NBA's current labor agreement is about to enter its final year, as Vice President of the NBA Players Union, James will be at the forefront of negotiations.
Given the significant increase in league revenue, thanks to the new telecast agreement and the fight between bosses and players about how to deal with the money, there is fear that the NBA will be shut down next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a freelancer next summer because he has renewed his three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017-18 season officially begins, James is in the contract.
Since the iPhone SE was spectacularly unveiled, the mobile phone market has also ushered in a boom of small screen machines.
Recently, Nubia also launched its first work in the Z11 series: NubiaZ11mini.
NubiaZ11mini continues its consistent excellence in photographing genes and comes equipped with a single hand more easily held 5.0-inch screen, easy to use rear fingerprint recognition, which has achieved its outstanding usage experience.
Nubia's newly listed small-screen photophone Z11mini reduced the price by 200 yuan, i.e. from the original 1499 yuan to 1299 yuan.
In terms of appearance, NubiaZ11mini uses a 5-inch 1080P screen and is still the classic "small red circle" design.
The middle frame is metal, and the bottom is symmetrically designed and configured by Type-C data interface.
The future of Portland smelters is uncertain due to the cancellation of power supply contracts
As the power company powered by the plant revealed that a factory owner would terminate a supply contract, thereby nullifying all supplies contracts, the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are now facing an uncertain future.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided not to continue issuing subsidies guaranteeing plant operations.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will be terminated in November.
2,000 workers at the U.S. aluminum company Portland plant may face unemployment.
Once the plant is closed, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And because the plant accounts for about 10% of Victoria's total electricity output, there may also be a chain reaction.
In 2014, U.S. aluminum shut down the Hanri Point Smelter, which led to last year's closure of Anglican power plants.
Aluminium company Portland smelters are currently at risk of loss and closure.
The move was made after forecasting the factory over the next few years, initially due to a stronger Australian dollar and recently because of the price of its products.
AGL provides electricity to this large aluminum smelter through the old Eyang power plant in the Latrob Valley. The company predicts that three other factory owners will also terminate their agreement.
The plant's largest shareholder is a joint venture between U.S.A. and Aluminium, while China's Sino-Cindian Group and Japan's Mel Red Company also hold small shares.
The joint venture said: "AGL expects Portland's plant to continue operating, which means the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand."
AGL said the contracts were a "hedging contract" that should have entered into force in November 2016.
The contract is terminated for 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
The power company said: "As a result, AGL still predicts that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal 2017."
Any possible revenue impact on AGL since fiscal 2018 is currently underpinned by the futures market's optimistic outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company has deducted $187 million in contract value from "expectations of termination."
The decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect U.S.A.'s ability to operate the smelter or guarantee the power supply of the smelter."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Old Eyang in 2010, which would have come into effect this November, but the company did not explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle will shut down due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
In response to comments by analysts earlier this week, AGL Operations Manager Stephen Mikelson said Portland's electricity consumption reached about 600 MW per year and the Tomago plant reached about 900 MW.
If the two factories are closed, demand in the electricity market will be greatly reduced.
"As a power company, that's not good news for us."
Community Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are denied each year by community legal centres. Funding for this service has been strained and is now facing further funding cuts.
In Queensland, three out of every five people have been denied access to free legal advice and agency services, most of them older persons, migrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the resources to fight unjust evictions.
The lack of funding for community-based legal services has long exceeded the limit and is now facing further cuts.
Since next June, federal funding for these legal centers will be reduced by another 30%.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said that according to the latest National Community Associations Legal Center survey report, thousands were denied each year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would only get worse if the federal government did not change existing decisions.
"Queensland's community law centre has long been underfunded, meaning thousands will be unable to access the critical services they need."
Those who need to stay away from violence, those with huge debts that cannot be repaid, families facing disintegration and oppressed workers face legal challenges, and the report shows they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut another 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland lawmaker George Brandys to immediately rescind these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when confronted with legal issues.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funds to national averages.
It is time to focus on the needs of community legal centers and their corresponding communities, and the White Lexi government must also invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team indicted for staff pulling guns
New York: Trump's campaign team has been charged with inaction after pulling a gun to a staff member while driving a jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodini said he had previously hoped that the matter could be resolved internally, but after waiting for months he realized "this can't happen."
According to Bodini's description, the header named Earl Phillip "picked out a pistol, put his right hand finger on the board and leaned toward Vincent's knee bones."
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bodini learned from the files that at least four others have experienced the same thing.
Bodini said in a complaint: "Not shooting does not mean that it will not cause harm."
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the masses in North Carolina that if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and selected her favorite judge, then "the person who supports the Second Amendment" - gun holders and gun lovers - might act.
Trump's campaign team said the media was legitimizing his words, and he did not advocate violence.
In the complaint, Bodini demanded that the campaign team compensate for its lax oversight and also Philip for his attacks, beatings and mental injuries.
Trump spokesman Hop Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
Couldn't contact Phillip.
According to Charlotte's local news agency WCCB, Philip recently left the campaigning team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not respond immediately to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaigning team is contentious.
Both sides of the case are Bodini and Trump's presidential campaign company, 16-CS-14300, ordinary court in Merkelenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our community, London, and the nation as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, as we did at the 2012 London Olympics to ensure that our country and region can benefit from these events.
The Olympics greatly benefited Stratford and the Eastern District.
And we will once again benefit the region by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
In our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and free young people around the airport from unemployment.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, some thought Heathrow's expansion was too large.
I have been told that Britain will not be able to prepare for the Olympics, and we will be disgraced in front of the world.
Challengers' suspicions about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their suspicions of the Heathrow project will also prove to be wrong.
While there are always obstacles that need to be overcome, Heathrow is tackling every problem he faces.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most people rather than a minority.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs and generate PS211 billion of economic growth, leaving a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team that has completed PS11 billion of infrastructure investment projects on time and within budget, including the T5 terminal to be elected as the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years and the T2 terminal between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now, they are ready to build a third runway with PS16 billion in private investment.
The UK successfully hosted the 2012 London Olympics, and I am confident that Heathrow Airport Expansion will also be a huge success.
It is now a good time for us to pass the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow Airport so that we can steer our future and create a technology and employment wealth that makes all of England proud.
Lord Paul Dyton is Chairman of the Heathrow Airport Board and Former Business Advisor to the British Treasury
A woman commits suicide and is killed on Swiss highway
The victim lays on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to commit suicide was trampled by multiple cars on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are currently looking for eyewitnesses.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway near Morges, Wow, in the early hours of Thursday.
Vozhou police said a woman "desperately" lay on the road late in the night and was trampled by multiple cars.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was apparently committed to suicide by several vehicles, including a van.
The woman died on the spot.
Police revealed that several of the drivers involved had been investigated, but some were still unconfirmed. The police are now calling on them and eyewitnesses to come for investigation.
Gillers Hofstadter's lawyer told the Geneva Tribune that criminal investigations are now underway, a routine process of such incidents.
However, it is not yet known whether the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
Hofstadter said: "This will be determined by the prosecutor."
Based on the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the driver will not be held accountable.
According to the report, both cases were caused by someone walking on the highway late in the night. The final verdict was that the driver could not expect pedestrians to cross the motorway at midnight.
Last year, a police officer was accused of inadvertently killing a man and stabbed him on the A1 highway near Pajane in August 2014.
The court was informed that the 22-year-old victim crossed the road after drinking alcohol.
After the investigation, the judge said that the woman's driving behavior at the time was completely legal and that the man appeared on the road "absolutely unexpected and unforeseen circumstances" and that she later called a first aid call.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Morday on Thursday should contact the police by calling 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was suitable for human habitation
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goldard Space Institute developed a model that could explore Venus' past, using tools and algorithms very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was used to determine whether Venus, which is surface high temperature, waterless and carbon dioxide-filled in the atmosphere, once had an environment similar to Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus rotated slower because of its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have once had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and at the time it rotated equally slowly.
The model also shows the early topography of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but once there were enough water and geologic changes to breed life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, sunlight illuminated on Venus was 30 percent darker than Earth.
Anthony Del Geno, a scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, explained in a press conference: "In the model simulation of the Goddard Institute for Space Research, Venus's slow spin makes its daytime time on one side up to nearly two months."
This makes the surface warmer and produces rainwater that can form thick clouds, which block most of the sun's heat from the ground like an umbrella.
The result of the simulation is that Venus' average climate temperature is actually a few degrees lower than today's Earth.
The model's simulated evolution of Venus is similar to that previously speculated by planetary scientists.
Although there may have been life on Venus, Venus has been exposed to too high temperatures and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
The ocean evaporates on the planet, and water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet light.
With the escape of hydrogen, only thicker carbon dioxide atmospheres and deadly greenhouse gas effects are left to form what we know about Venus today.
The researchers published simulations of the new Venusian climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Newsletter.
Patrick Roy resigns as avalanche manager
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche Ice Club on Thursday, saying he had no say at the team's decision-making level.
Colorado Executive Vice President Managing Director Joe Sachs confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement: "Over the last three years I have worked with vitality, passion and determination to perform my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche."
I've been seriously thinking about how to improve this team throughout the summer so that it can have a higher level of strength.
To this end, the goal of the coach and vice president must be consistent with the goals of the club.
He also has to have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
However, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sachs hired Roy on May 23, 2013, and he thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today."
We thank him for his contribution to the club and hope that he will steer smoothly in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award League's best coach in the first season of 2013-14.
He helped the club get 112 points, ranking first in the central division. But the Colorado team was eliminated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost arms with the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015-16 season, the Avalanche team scored 39 wins 39 square 4 and eventually lost its second foreign card qualifying in the Western Major League.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups and two each when he played for the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
North Sea oilfield workers stop strike and continue negotiations
The chief negotiator said workers in the North Sea oilfield had halted a strike on compensation, and the parties to the dispute began a new round of negotiations.
The North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell has seen several strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute settlement process."
We will start earlier next week with a number of full-day meetings in the coming weeks to revisit these issues.
The union said its recent action was to protest a possible 30% pay cut, the first time in 25 years.
Wood Group has cut the compensation of North Sea contractors by about 9% this year due to market pressures.
Prior to this pay cut, the company reduced compensation for offshore contractors by 10 percent in 2014.
The company said that a pay cut again will help the company to survive the crunch of the market.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas equipment in 10 countries, as the company needs to streamline its operations after merge with British Energy Corporation UK Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from lower crude oil prices and the UK's decision to Brexit in June.
Scotland's parliamentarian, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labor dispute of the North Sea generation.
He said the North Sea is crucial for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that serves a majority rather than a minority."
In 2016, spending on new projects in North Sea is expected to not exceed $1.4 billion, while the average project expenditure over the past five years has reached about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Aung Seustian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers capture the most complete spin-off speed of star clusters.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the cluster's stars have different rotational speeds and their cycles are associated with the planet.
Lusa Rebul, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said: "We want to learn more about the relationship between star mass, age and even history of its solar system by comparing our results with other clusters."
The Aung Sea star cluster is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars in this cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are now just reaching adulthood.
They reached the highest rotational speed in their lifetime.
At the highest rotational speed, these mature stars emit a large number of star winds.
When these stellar winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they act as brakes on stars.
As the age of a star increases, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time that can be identified as stellar blackheads (like sunspots).
The latest rotational speed dataset shows that larger stars are rotating at a slower rate than smaller ones.
Rebell compared the stars to dancers, with larger-sized dancers spinning at a slower rate than smaller-scale dancers.
Reuble said: "In the 'Ballet Dance Show' of Aung Sanctuary, we found that slow-moving stars tend to be larger in mass, while fastest-moving stars tend to be the lightest."
Due to its proximity, it can serve as an ideal cosmological laboratory for comparing star mass with rotational speed.
Reuble said: "The Aung Seustian cluster laid the foundation for a two-way rotational theoretical model of young and older stars."
We still have a lot of knowledge about how, when and why stars slow down rotational speed and "take up their own dance shoes."
Reuble and her colleagues elaborated their latest analysis of the rate of rotation in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The head of the Southern Lake Park Water Management Section Zheng Jianjun introduced that the deepest depths of the southern lake are more than 10 meters deep, without understanding the situation of water users, it is likely to be dangerous.
"Although the Southern Lake rescue team is very professional, it still hopes that a large number of boating tourists can wear life jackets, do not take irregular actions on the lake, and play safe games," Zheng said.
The surrounding village has a unique marine environment, with two main recreational tourism resources of natural and human ecology.
"But the individual owners who bought the parking lot in the area, fearing that doing so would affect their own rental price, and suspect others are self-serving, so they have been behind the destruction, resulting in the improvement of the parking space was put on hold."
On the question of when and from whom to introduce porcelain, the academic community's statements are still varied.
In the current more mainstream view, the introduction of porcelain mainly has three lines.
Among the three lines introduced by french fries, the most influential and widely spread is that Chen Zhenlong was introduced into Fuzhou by the Philippines.
The Beijing Municipal Social Groups Management Office will conduct a special inspection of the use of uniform receipts for social groups' contributions from now on.
Inspections are divided into two units of self-examination and focused sampling.
The relevant head of the municipal community office introduced that the scope of this inspection includes social groups who have received a unified receipt for contributions from social groups in 2013-2015.
In its 2012 Olympic communications strategy, the Rio Organising Committee said: "The success of the Olympics is defined by those who share stories on social media."
From the report of this Olympic Games, various media have made a lot of changes in the mode of communication, product form, language style, and news perspective.
The IOC and media practitioners from all over the world seem to have come up with this challenge.
On August 11, the public development and sale of Guangda Securities H shares entered the last day. It is reported that the market reaction in the first two days of the prospectus was smooth. According to the plan, it will be listed at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on August 18.
A domestic broker analyst said that Eastern securities are not good in the base of Hong Kong, its management business is the East Banking Institute. Compared to Central Bank International, China Credit Securities and other banking intermediaries, it seems inherently inadequate.
Experts pointed out that since this year, with the return of the securities market to calm, many brokerage performance has declined, but after the company's listing situation should be more dependent on the development of the company's own business, can not be summarized.
After the introduction of this new regulation, Suzhou will become the first second-tier city in the country to restart the limited purchase.
The second-tier cities that have introduced or are about to introduce the city's regulatory policy not only in Suzhou but also in Hefei, Nanjing and other cities.
Previously, Hefei has been the first to issue a credit limit policy, for buyers with two suites and an unliquidated housing loan under Hefei's name, the bank will refuse to provide mortgage services.
Last week, the old-fashioned drama "American Private Room Food" temporarily shutdown, unexpectedly sparked a warm discussion about the domestic film's rating of falsehood.
Civil rights groups send travel warnings to Missouri
Due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the American Association for the Promotion of Colored Persons (NAACP) has issued travel warnings to colourful people who are preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which came into effect on August 28, 2017, called for special attention and utmost caution by all African-American travellers, tourists and citizens of Missouri when travelling in Missouri due to a recent series of suspected racial incidents," the group said.
NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and the state's law enforcement has also targeted minorities to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of the rights of citizens are happening to people.
They were interrogated by parking, beaten or killed because of their skin color," NasaCP president Rod Chapper told The Kansas City Star.
"We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in the United States against a certain state.
The group cited the University of Missouri's racial slander against black students and the death of a 28-year-old Tennessee black man, Toly Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died under suspicious circumstances. He depleted fuel during his trip to Missouri and was detained by the Missouri police without charges of crime.
According to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, "black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be parked than white."
"The consultation was intended to raise awareness of what might happen to their families, friends and colleagues in Missouri."
"People need to be prepared, whether by carrying bail money to Missouri or letting relatives know they are traveling within the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime report program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the number of crimes, it ranks 16th in the country.
Travel warnings are also a response to Missouri's new law that will make it even more difficult to prosecute housing or employment-based businesses.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration law requiring local law enforcement to detain immigrant offenders, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of ethnic lawsuits and issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently advisory groups have taken this approach to respond to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the "golden era" of 2015, the overall film market in 2016 entered a calm period, and whether to break through last year's total box office score of 44.069 billion yuan will become a suspense.
According to the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, in October, Beijing's new and used homes prices were both cooling down, with an increase of only 0.6% and 1.1%.
Lupesku, the current UEFA Chief Technical Officer, made a technical report on the 2016 European Championship and last season's Champions League at this meeting.
The BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the outside feel "living in a new era"
The British media reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly transforming into today's modern charm city.
The Chinese capital boasts an amazing speed of the Internet, cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition software, investing heavily in artificial intelligence and possessing unrivaled international energy, one of the most exciting cities for exploratory foreigners.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German diaspora Clemens Seych said: "If I could succeed there, I would have succeeded anywhere in the future."
Sehi, creative director at Traveler Archives magazine, said: "If Sinatra lives to this day, he'll likely sing a city like Beijing."
Simmon Norton, who is home in England but recently living in Beijing, published an article on his personal blog website 4Corners7Seas: "People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand and it's difficult to tell clearly, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will look like and want to witness with their own eyes."
The city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technologically friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever.
Andy Penafullt, who currently serves as deputy editor-in-chief at the Beijing Children website, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society where the Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones that make it easier for everyone to do many transactions."
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambition, and facial recognition software has become popular, with many mobile apps using this technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of motorcyclists.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to spend 13.8 billion yuan on building an artificial intelligence science and technology park where more than 400 businesses will be set up, focusing on developing a variety of AI technologies from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also at the heart of many major festivals in China over the years, and participation in these celebrations is lauded by foreigners, Spring Festival is the most important social and economic holiday, and one of the most easily attended holidays for foreigners.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the coming year, cleaning apartments and writing red spring leagues with new-year blessings on home posters are equally important. On New Year's Eve, all family members will be gathered together to eat a rich meal before keeping their years old until midnight and welcoming them with bright fireworks." For foreigners, having this night with friends and family is indeed an opportunity of integration."
The number of foreigners in Beijing is large and growing, but Chinese language barriers and the convenience of communication between diasporas are easily an excuse for their incomplete integration into local culture.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but there is little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to reach out to the Chinese isn't a success, then you can easily feel more comfortable with other foreigners."
In these so-called "old outer bubbles" ("old outer bubbles") refer to foreigners only intermingling among foreigners, without contact with local people and local culture - translators note), foreigners holding groups in their own communities, eating at Western restaurants, and only foreigners among friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin - that's easier than people might have imagined.
Says Sehi: "The last one or two hours a week of Chinese private teaching or entry-level radio shows should be suitable for everyone's busy schedule."
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting on taxis.
Relentless air pollution is also a fact in everyday life, but the government has struggled to contain some problems in recent years.
Residents emphasized the importance of outdoor activities in often lighter warm months, and to take those blue days as an opportunity to wander around or explore popular Japanese park.
Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that can find the most things below the surface, and you can discover great artistic and musical activities, amiable nightlife, historical wonders, ultramodern business areas and ancient Hukong districts."
The report argues that the impediment to human capital growth is becoming increasingly apparent, especially in the Northeast region, with an average annual contribution of aging to human capital growth of -1.28%.
Mr. Pan pointed out that the current risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled, and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of payments still exist for a long time.
China Xinyi Network Beijing December 17 (Journalist Gao Kai) The world is brilliant due to its heritage - 2016 International Summit Forum on the Identification and Restoration of Ancient Chinese Paintings was opened at the People's University of China on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone vendors to preinstall software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers or not allowing them to use other Google apps.
The European Commission considers the move to harm consumer interests and impede competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If antitrust charges are set up, Google faces a maximum of 10 percent penalty for its global revenue, about $7.4 billion.
Google hasn't immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing EU investigations due to its bias toward home shopping services in the search results.
Zhang Yuning's ocean is solid, it can be said that his achievement of the "beatdown" from national to nationalo is not accidental, and the extent of his leaping growth remains surprising.
A map to understand: Bitcoin's legal status around the world
In addition to the price corrections naturally triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency crashes is also associated with "hostile" - regulatory risks are unrelated.
From a visual map, Eastern countries are more conservative in their attitude toward bitcoin than the West, and nations that dominate the world still look to the legitimacy of digital currencies, representing "black swan risk" remains very high.
*This article comes from Wall Street Knowing (WeChat ID: Wallstreetc), editor Wangmu. For more information please login to Wallstreetc.com, or download the Wall Street Knowing App.*
With the heyday of regulatory storms in key bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the EU, the global digital currency led by Bitcoin has been crippled since this week, with prices falling below $10,000 psychologically intact on Tuesday, marking its largest single-day decline in three years.
In addition to the price corrections naturally triggered by speculative properties, this round of digital currency crashes is also linked to a longstanding "host" - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the visualization of Big Data website HowMuch.net produced a map showing Bitcoin's legality and regulatory status in countries around the world.
Green represents the legitimate market for bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not officially legalized its status, but there are no major restrictions on use; light pink represents a restricted market, i.e. local governments try to approach the use of digital currencies through red line policies or regulations; deep pink represents the country where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; gray is an unrecognized country.
(Figures from HowMuch.Net visualization team map on January 15)
The article pointed out that from the distribution of non-green color blocks in the figure, it can be seen that the traditional attitude of Eastern countries towards bitcoin is more conservative than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country to define bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the biggest restricted markets for Bitcoin, India is one of the largest countries that has not yet been evaluated and have not adopted relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance rate of bitcoin, i.e. more concentrated distribution of green blocks.
The view of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on bitcoin has been markedly differentiated, and the distribution of color blocks in these regions is more ambiguous.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are the legitimate bitcoin market, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and other countries have some restrictions on their trading and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken about Bitcoin.
Combined with the above data, a total of 99 (or 40 percent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally do not impose restrictions on Bitcoin transactions and use, i.e. green and orange regions.
Seven countries (or 3% of the share) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 (or 4%) define bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 (or 53%) have not treated more information about digital currencies (gray).
This illustrates that countries, which make up 53 percent of the world's subjects (more than half), are still looking for the legitimacy of bitcoin-led digital currencies in their territory, and also represents Bitcoin's "black swan risk" as part of them may eventually make legislative decisions restricting digital currencies.
The article argues that global regulators have not yet fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason most countries have not yet made a statement.
Although Bitcoin's "humanity" has grown exponentially since last year, it doesn't represent interest in all countries, some may fear local currency threats or even more that digital currencies are being exploited by criminal organizations.
Wall Street has written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against bitcoin since last week, including the beginning of China's crackdown on online platforms and mobile apps for centralized services at off-site exchanges, South Korea's ongoing consideration of closing digital currency exchanges, the EU's view that Bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warned investors to risk "blood loss".
Wall Street's editor-in-chief selected "Ready to hear: 2018: the global central mom opened the digital currency year?", has mentioned that from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism and adoption, 2018 will become the digital currency year of the global central bank.
The practice of major powers such as Russia criticizing Bitcoin's legality status is also intended to give way to the official issuance of digital currencies.
Xinhua News Agency Madrid on January 8 (reporter Xijui) Barcelona New Aid Coutino debuted for the first time wearing a BAZA jersey in Nocampo on August 8.
Kutino passed the Barcelona medical examination in the morning and signed a contract with President Bartomeu to expire in summer 2023.
He then appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 Northamp fans.
According to Spanish media, Kutino's total transfer fee or 160 million euros (one euro or about 7.77 yuan) is the first price in history for the Barcelona Club and La Liga.
Since Kutino is still injured in the body, it takes him nearly 20 days to receive his debut appearance wearing a BASA jersey.
What else is sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most definitive sign of regime change is when they began attacking the statues.
So Saddam Hussein, in the 2003 Baghdad Paradise Square, was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key think tanks, was sure to know what would happen when he quarrelled with CNN Jim Acosta about the president's proposal to strictly limit legal immigrants.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did so, then a group of boat owners and followers of liberalism would surely devour him alive.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when Emma Lazarus' famous poems were engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built seventeen years later).
As Miller rebuked Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the goddess of freedom is a symbol of America's free illuminating world."
The poem you refer to is later added, not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself says, it's not really about history.
This refers to the modern echoes of Lazarus's marvellous language, and the only country seems to invite not only any old immigrants but also the poorest of the poor: "Your exhaustion, your poverty, or your crowded people want free breath,/the suffering people reject you overcrowded beaches."
No "suffering people refuse" at a moment when our screen becomes sharper.
Miller did not work on literary commentary, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcomed in the U.S. during the Trump era.
This conflict about the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it actually conflicts with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends who held events after her death to engrave her poems on the pedestal, were aware of the highly political nature of their activities.
The purpose of the sculpture is to express the link between French and U.S. republicanism by means of an ancient classic parable, feminine incarnation as a free goddess.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poems, women's images were no longer abstract and she was going to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the exiled mother.
The combination of the poem with this painting is a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American nativism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing people have always wanted to repurpose it.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, who was a temporary baptist at Trump's arrival in 2010 believed that liberalism wasn't an invitation to anyone, and he is now an early neoconservative who brought the intellectual flame of America to the world of stupidity: "The goddess of freedom is courageous."
She intended to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to other parts of the world.
"The torch is not the way that illuminates America."
Unusually, Linbo was actually impressed by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
Lazarus' very imaginative approach is to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people are going through a long and often dreadful journey, they can see it on the ship deck.
On the surface, this involves looking at the world perspectives of those who seek asylum and have an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them the hope and welcome intent that they need to hear.
Of course, this is not the point that Miller and Trump have wanted to acknowledge.
Their torch is not intended to illuminate the road, but to inflame hatred of their only source of power.
In 2006, Sa's top joined the Universal Records with its unique musical style and became the first Chinese to sign a contract with Global UK headquarters.
2017 FIFA World Cup: Neil Black highly praised Scottish nationals
Eilidh Doyle recalls that there were only two Scots in the British national team.
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said a team of 16 strong Scots in the World Championships group would "make a huge contribution to the national team."
The number of Scottish field athletes selected to attend the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, is one of the largest in history.
Black believes that "scotland is making extraordinary progress," and British trackers must learn from it.
"We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed," Blake said.
"I'm looking for a conversation with people at the Scottish Academy of Sports. They think this is related to their actions."
Scottish Athletics consider this to be related to their actions.
The British Athletics Association considers this to be related to their actions.
Even the streetrs think so.
Whatever the situation is, it's superb."
Several Scottish Athletics are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be at 5,000 meters above Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle is selected by the team as captain.
"Ariel is a little humble.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable," Blake said.
"Many track athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, or live or train anywhere, come out of the door with pride and effort.
"Erid's passion and genuine affection for nature is very good."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will take part in the 400-meter cross-track race at his fifth World Cup, said that there were 16 Scots in the British national team, which was "unimaginable."
Previously, the number of Scottish trackers who competed in the World Series was at a maximum of seven, or 1983 and 2015.
The runner-up, Muir, was a leading figure who made five British records and two European records over the past year.
She will compete in 1500 meters and 5000 meters projects.
Chris O'Hare, who competed in the 1500-meter project, was another notable Scottish player before she had a good track record for the season, winning both England's qualifiers and Olympic anniversary.
Doyle recalls her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was deeply proud that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases will also challenge medals and compete for the final.
"The special thing about being a national team leader is that it was voted by other national teams. So knowing your teammates voted to pick you up for extremely unusual accomplishments, in any case, would be a great honour for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all Scotlanders.
It just shows how far we have gone.
And they're all the old track athletes here, who are about to move towards the goal of Run登 podium.
How was my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's great.
I have just referenced the fact that in this case we are very lucky, because we hold the World Championships on our home.
So it is really important that we are supported by the home and grow as a result of our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to play the game, and the atmosphere there will be unspeakable."

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't bear the reproach of voters, don't run for public office.
Our father understands the behavior of bad media.
Americans all love Washington, but soon afterwards the major newspapers began to lash out at him for everything from domestic politics to political principles.
He was irritated by these criticisms, no doubt.
But he didn't silence those critics.
As far back as 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech is denied - we will be slaughtered in silence and folly like a lamb."
This reminds me of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people as they posted their views on his Facebook official homepage.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff believed the lawsuit was rash, and online reports filled with their strong resentment: "Who cares?"
Many people say, "It's just Facebook."
But, that's important.
This is especially important because people like Hogan are facing it.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a democratically dominated state, and he was also surprisingly popular.
Among the country's 50 governors, he was ranked second.
Hogan is not a reactionary madman.
He smoothly managed Maryland and strictly adhered to the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to connect with voters, jokingly showing his baldness after chemotherapy for the first time on the home page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's homepage comment is completely unnecessary and ultimately dangerous. This homepage is a public forum, an official management platform marked by public tax-paying staff members.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan spokesman Amelia Shas defended the governor's actions saying she believed blocking their comments was just about trying to keep them a little restrained.
But they overly sloppyly described it as a flooding beast or cynical.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people blocked by Hogan.
They're just ordinary people talking to their own leaders: Their identities are teachers, small business owners and pastors, not a flooding beast.
They say their comments are deep, respectful and not downstream.
The pastor cites the Bible in his post, calling for Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakhimi Salma Ramani, a barrister at Bowie in Maryland, is not cynical, but she asks questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post News Story Review section, "I'm politely commenting that I am disappointed by his failure to respond to hate crimes and other recent news events."
I also don't like a bunch of people commenting on the same topic, because they will be directly ignored by some as being so-called psychedelic rather than regarded as citizens of a group of troubled nations."
The "intensive garbage information bombardment" that the governor's staff called may seem to others to be a "continuance."
The Facebook era makes it easy to modify an information, only by shielding a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It was also clearer than in the past, and to achieve the same effect in those years it would be necessary to send staff out to collect and burn newspapers with criticism or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what is happening right now, but it's on the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users because he blocked them on Twitter.
There was a landmark ruling last week in Virginia about such issues.
According to District Judge James C. Cacharis of Alexandria, the United States, Lauden County Supervisory Committee's act of shielding voters from her Facebook homepage violated the First Amendment.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) is also admired by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage fees and the Internet had similar influences.
The number of news newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, with anonymised letters strongly criticizing his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington had an anonymous flooding beast against him.
People use the pseudonyms of Juricra, Valerius, Belizeria, Pojos and others to write to news outlets harshly criticizing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online project, his office was flooded with petitions and criticized his attitude towards the Treaty on Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty King of England and the United States of America.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
Real leaders need to accept this.
A strand of the city's wind breeze is dragging people's sensitive nerves.
Restrictions are a hard lever for many city real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced regulations that undergraduates will continuously pay social security for half a year and can enjoy the same housing purchase policy of local permanent residents;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that stipulates that university students can be registered after three years of graduation by the certificate of graduation and employment.
Then the policy adds to the code, the official said that "university students can buy less than 20% of the price of the market".
In July, Chengdu issued regulations that young talents with undergraduate and higher qualifications in foreign universities can apply for the registration capital through a graduation certificate.
In addition, there are also cities or regions such as Kunshan, Shanghai Lingang and other cities or regions that have introduced the relevant policy of "introducing talent", reducing the threshold for talent purchase and registration.
Zhang Grand believes that this is actually the competition of major cities for the population, especially talents, retaining the population, especially talents, and the city is competitive, which is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some even believe that this means the time has come to cancel the "restricted purchase" of the building.

Ronan Rafferty looks forward to enjoying the feeling of home at Renaissance Club
The 25th Scottish Open will be hosted by the East Loczian Renaissance Club, where former European champion Ronan Laverty will enjoy a sense of home in the next three days.
The Northern Irishman last year led the next-door Acherfield Links to the final, but eventually lost to Paul Ils. He now works for the new venue and serves as an ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Salvatty.

Jeremy founded this place unrivalled.
He is a keen proponent of the game and is also very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to show this stadium."
The Englishman Ils looks forward to defending for the first time, although he has won European Tours and European Challenges at the same time in his 32-year career.
Shosport's athlete said, "This is really special.
I didn't defend the Estremadura Open because it was canceled in my second year of winning.
It feels magical to come to this place.
Playing golf here is wonderful.
For me and my wife, Salon, last year's victory has a special meaning for us.
It's really a special recollection, and we will always remember."
Returning to the home race is Garry Or, who was just 50 years old earlier this year, and then took part in the European Evergreen Tour.
This is his first time in the Scottish Golf Open since 2013.
Helensbergman Or said: "There will always be more meaning in the home race.
You want to do it well; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again and I've been playing golf.
I am very pleased with the current situation."
Joining the three-player group are former Masters winners Ian Woodsnan and Junior Champions Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNeutty.
There were six Scottish athletes on the field, two of whom are Or and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torons, with four others: Andrew Odkorn, Stephen McCallister, Bill Longmu and Rose Drammond.

China's Environmental Protection Ministry environmental inspector General Zou Xiangmin introduced in Beijing on the 22nd of August, a total of 57 cases were implemented throughout the country on a daily basis, and this year's new amendments to the Environmental Protection Law significantly reduced China's environmental law enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection authorities in all parts of China can use punishments such as daily penalties, sealing seizures, limiting and discontinuing production and transfer of administrative detention to investigate environmental violations and cooperate with the judicial authorities to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of sealing and seizure were carried out across China; a total of 177 cases of production restrictions and discontinuation were implemented; a total of 189 administrative detentions were transferred and a total of 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes were transferred.
Among them, Henan implemented seven consecutive punishments on a daily basis, and China is currently embeding from the end control to the full range of environmental pollution management.
Although the downward pressure of the economy appears, but China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously clearly stated that China should properly handle the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, strengthen the "green power", the faster the economic growth downstream, the less able to relax the environmental protection and play the role of environmental protection optimization for the economy.

There is one word from our cadres in Zimbabwe.
The geographical advantage is less than the cadre advantage, the policy preferences are not better than the quality of service, and the dedication of the spirit of Red Ships allows us to strive for success.
courageous to fight
Recently, some of the representatives and well-known artists of the 19th Congress of China's People's Liberation Army organized a publicity mission to inland Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guizhou and other places to preach the spirit of the 19th Congress.
They went deep into the grassroots mass art pavilions, local assemblies and some colleges in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Gansu and other places, to the 19th spiritual Chinese artists' new cultural mission.
I am deeply proud and happy, I want to sink down again and write more about the fate of the small people of the great era.
In this context, there are some good suggestions for the development of art and culture at this grassroots level.
Now the people's literature is very lively, there is a bit of popularization.
Constantly rolling out the unworthy of the era of fine craftsmanship.
It should be rooted and grassroots, deep in life, then to make works with a certain cultural thickness, positive upside down, and at the same time there is a constant artistic charm.
It has reached 28, the real-world contracted land area of 15.2 billion acres, of which there are 11.1 billion hectares completed.
Eighty-two per cent of the area covered by two rounds of family contracted farmland has been reported to the Party Central Committee and the State Council in seven provinces such as Sichuan.
It is expected that by the end of 2018, the national contracting authority will be basically completed.
In the future, the Ministry of Agriculture will explore authentic results.
China's first star in the series of space science satellites is also the world's first dark matter particle detection satellite.
Over the course of nearly two years, four scans have been carried out across the entire sky and more than 3.5 billion high-energy particles have been detected to achieve the highest accuracy in the world.
This result has been published in the international academic journal Nature.
In space, we observe such a new one that has not been observed before, which cannot be explained and illustrated by this existing theory.
The significance of this research is multiplicity, and most importantly it demonstrates the use of cutting-edge technologies by Chinese scientists.
The ability to manufacture scientific instruments to detect a very difficult scientific problem.
Looking for a toilet by the nose, it was last century, many people about the memory of Chinese toilets.
Integrated with more and more humanistic designs
A lot of tourists are impressed, the toilet is ventilated all year round and no smell.
No need to look for toilets anymore.
Not only to change hardware, software must keep up with
Tourism department requires that the area toilets should be equipped with toilet paper and handwashing
But in some areas
Is it possible to stop this service because of the uncivilized behavior of individuals?
Managers from all over the world have made a choice.
On the one hand, saving is advocated through civilizational hints, on the other hand, technological innovation is also being carried out.
Public toilets in Nanjing, Jiangsu City and other places
Three seconds to brush your face, you can get a toilet paper for free, but if you want to get two copies, you need to wait another ten minutes.
Avoid misuse of public-use resources
As a habit, some tourists may be really thinking about bringing the paper back, but on the other hand we have to reflect.
Isn't there any paper on the next toilet that our tourists are going to enter, so this is what we particularly emphasize in our new three-year plan?
To fix this imbalance insufficiency.
To push the toilet revolution into depth is to think more about the masses.
There must be a third bathroom, so that the family can accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We took our baby, the man's toilet and we were sorry to accompany him.
The little girl's toilet kid is so small as to know a little embarrassment, the plate is especially comfortable, very convenient for us to bring children.
At the same time, people feel civilization as they become builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers in the Guangxi River Pool are building new rinsing toilets at home
There has been a lot of success, and actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people stay away from diseases, but also drive economic development to narrow regional development gaps.
This toilet problem is a tabular issue, a node for the development of social problems.
It is a national civilisation project that guides and layouts from the point of view of the country, and then addresses small social problems with different degrees of participation.
That's how we patched all of our shortcuts.
With the Heilongjiang Jinxi Shuttle Project recently started construction, this year's national new major hydropower projects have reached 14.
The investment is worth 90 billion yuan.
At present, the enrolment rate of children with disabilities and adolescents in compulsory education has reached more than 90%.
The high-speed railway connecting Xi'an and Chengdu will begin operation on December 6, with the first trains and the year-end charting of pre-train tickets starting to be sold today.

The first common iron tunnel in the Yellow River has been built recently.
The tunnel is three o'clock and seven kilometers long, and after completion it will pass through the Yellow River directly connected to Jinan Main City Area.
Spiritual connotations
Next, look at the international news.
The U.S. Senate voted on a large-scale tax cut bill.
The analysis said it marked the Trump administration and Congressional Republican Party, a step closer to completing the U.S.'s largest tax cut program in three decades.
The Republican-majority Senate eventually passed the tax cut by 51 votes in favor and 49 against.
And provides opportunities for lowering the middle class
But Democrats have criticized the bill for benefiting major U.S. businesses and wealthy people.
U.S. President Donald Trump II voted to pass a tax cut bill in the Senate

According to a spokesman for Yemen's Houthi fighters and former president Salih, the escalation of crossfire between the two armies in the capital Sanaa has now resulted in eighty deaths.
According to eyewitnesses, the two sides of the conflict were carrying heavy weapons such as tanks and fighting on the streets of Sana'a, with thousands of people and children trapped in central Sana'a.
Currently, the Republican Guards that support Saleh also occupy the airport.
The presidential palace and some of the important government agencies announced that curfews would be imposed in the occupied area
Hussein's armed forces claimed to have controlled the television station that belonged to Saleh today.
Hussein and Saleh formed an alliance at the end of 2014 to confront Yemen's legitimate government led by President Hadith.
In September this year, the Houthis announced the appointment of an army commander.
Salih refused to acknowledg the appointment.
At the end of November, sporadic clashes began between Saleh supporters and Houthi rebels.
At the same time, Yemen's former president Salih said:
He is ready to open a new chapter of his relationship with the Saudi-led multinational coalition, beginning to work with the coalition in a positive way.
However, the premise is that the multinational coalition forces will stop attacking Yemen first.
In this regard, the multinational coalition forces led by Saudi Arabia issued a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump said his campaign team and the Russian side had absolutely no collusion.
This is Trump's former president's national security assistant, Flynn.
For the first time after recognition of false testimony to respond to the Tomsk investigation
Trump also said he was not worried about what Flynn would say to investigators.
No. 1, Flynn admitted to the judge that he had falsely testified to the FBI about his personal contacts with Russia.
He has repeatedly expressed objections to the German government's acceptance of foreign immigrants, and even right-handed remarks that Germany should be proud of World War II veterans.
The congress gathered a large number of local people outside to protest, who strongly opposed the far-right populist claims of choosing the party.
In the German Federal House of Representatives elections in September this year, the Selected Party was elected as the third largest party in the House of Commons.
It was the first time after World War II that far-right parties entered the Federal House.

From today, News Intermediate launched a series of reports on "New era new meteorological action".
This is the world's first company to develop and manufacture educational robots, after graduating from Xiao Xu University in 23 years.
He chose to go to Shanghai, and for half a year he already had his own team.
My dream is to make a robot that belongs to me and can help others.
The robot needs some motors, rudders and then controllers that can now be developed by themselves.
Shanghai's introduction of a preferential policy
It also led a number of innovative talents to stay in China and remain in Shanghai.
The report of the 19th Congress for the first time proposed to build a modernized economic system and demanded
Smart manufacturing companies are transforming from traditional manufacturing industries
In the first three quarters of this year, the value of intelligent manufacturing production was close to 1.6 billion yuan, and it grew nearly 40% year-on-year.
Being the control system of that elevator, in previous years we clearly felt the whole industry its new energy is insufficient, so we
Strengthening the transformation and development of this enterprise
Shanghai is speeding up its progress towards a globally influential science and technology innovation center, as requested by Secretary-General Xi Jinping.
In order to accelerate scientific research results from paper to money, this year Shanghai enacted local regulations to promote the transformation and service of scientific and technological achievements.
Ten days after the closing of the 19th Congress, Shanghai also issued implementation opinions to further promote the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.
In the process of innovation, there are many inconveniences.
burst their vitality.
In the new era, scientific and technological innovation is possible.
The Small Satellite Innovation Institute of the Academy of Science in Shanghai is an avant-garde for innovative research on satellite technology in China.
To do something novelty, the goal of this task in itself is new.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Badtina Daiger didn't need a stove when cooking.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Her cottage is located in Anarotali, Indonesia's capital of Panay County, Papua province, where the housewives usually just put a potato - locally called "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, the scorched potato was taken out by a pair of hands that were not washed up and swallowed.
Daiger sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and it was also her place to do everyday household chores such as washing clothes, washing their clothes with very turbid water, all from nearby swamps.
A room without a roof has a bucket, which is the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her four wives, so she wasn't assigned to the fields for care.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it would be dangerous to work late: most of the men in the village did not work, and many were drunk with mud, plus there were a lot of soldiers here.
She said, "No one dared walk in the village after 5 p.m."
This is a rare glimpse of daily life on the Papuan Highlands, once a Dutch colony and incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, but it was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by raising hands in front of the army that occupied the area.
The movement, which is now strongly demanding independence and opposition to Dutch rule, has quickly turned its finger on the Jakarta government, which exerts a high-pressure regime over the region that isolates foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province officially split into Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
The location of Anarotali is remote and unsmoking; to get here, you need to take a 90-minute plane from the provincial capital Chayapra to Nabire, then rent a car for 5 hours.
There is no public transport here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, the wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo fences and folding iron leather roofs are a variety of yellow and brown coverings made of rust.
Few Indonesians came in, let alone journalists and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian preachers, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god named Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Daiger says "we don't wear these clothes." She refers to her colourful weaving turbans, dark shirts and bright semi-dresses.
"We used to cover our bodies only with leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line as well as Asia's highest infant mortality rate and lowest literacy rate.
But it's also the golden continent of Indonesia.
Paniay County is located on a high ground, roughly the same area as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world's largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg is only 60 miles away from it, owned by Phoenix-based Philip McMoran Coal.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper mines here.
In addition, the timber resources of Papua are abundant and estimated to be valued at $78 billion.
However, these rich resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, so that Indonesia's strong military power has been able to suppress them all the time.
A 2005 New York Times survey reported that Philips paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The demands of the Papuans for independence were growing stronger, which threatened the gold lord and thus subjected them to cruel treatment.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by Indonesian forces.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass massacres in the Papuan tribal highlands of the 1970s have been upgraded to genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peace protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, "We Will Lose Everything," included evidence of past year's misdeeds such as extrajudicial executions, torture - another report said rape and electrocenography were particularly common - and brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
Andrias Harsolno, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: "Violence occurs every day and therefore it is difficult to calculate the number of victims."
Papua's resources have attracted a large number of migrants outside Indonesia, and oppression has begun.
Eighty-three percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christians, but Muslim economic migrants have changed their demographics since they arrived in densely populated Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Suravezi.
The Java people's snack stalls sell frying chickens and vegetables mixed with Gadocado, paired with peanut sauce.
The locals struggled.
24-year-old Paniai local Abos Yu moved to the provincial capital Chayapla for a job, explaining that "those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than native Papuans."
This left the local Papuans - mama-mama - losing their market."
Indonesia's President Zoko Vidodo (often referred to as Zokovi) vowed to address Papua's inequality and abuse of power during his campaign in 2014.
The former carpenter's way to Jakarta's presidential palace was supported by 27 of all 29 districts, including Paniyeh.
But Papua hasn't changed anything, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"We have already broken our hearts and we voted for Zokovi in 2014, hoping that he will fulfill our desire to restore justice again."
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Panay suffered the most horrific nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, eleven children in Anarotali sang Christmas salutations before a fire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly rode on a motorcycle.
Shocked children told them that they should open the headlight.
According to local priest Yavite Tbey, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four.
Victims and eyewitnesses said the drunken soldiers used their guns to chase the children.
Then one of the soldiers fired a gun at the children.
16-year-old Julianus Yemme was comatose for being severely beaten.
A few hours later, the nearby government agency's Electoral Commission building ignited a massive fire and the incident escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field ahead of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They took the ceremonial bows and danced with waita dancing in the Papuan Mee Pago tribe - running around the circle, and imitating bird trumpet.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the military routine outpost.
According to an official document seen in Time magazine, when emotions continue to escalate, soldiers receive orders via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately."
56-year-old Jeremyas Cayamu, the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighborhood, felt imminent danger and called on the crowd to calm down and begged them to come home.
No one listened to him.
He stood on the porch of his colourful wooden house and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Cayamu still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullet came from among the assembled soldiers.
He added: "It was very crowded and they fired a lot of guns."
According to a cousin of the local man, Olvyus Yur, he witnessed the shooting and saw three shots in his body.
Yuhannes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran past to check his body to see if he was."
I found him dead...I kissed him."
Papuan Police Chief Inspector Juger Mend told reporters that his subordinates were only in the "protective" police station because of the attack.
In 2015, Papuan police spokesman and head of the police Pugio Sulistio said: "When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves."
This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and more were injured.
The next day's news of the killing only slowly spreads in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi delivered a eloquent speech in Chayapla expressing deep sympathy to the victims' families and vowing to address the abuses of Papuan history.
He said, "I hope this case can be resolved as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future."
In October 2016, security minister Virando said he would set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for depreciation also sounded almost immediately.
He said, "Most of the assaults occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are committed to resolving these violations, but this requires a process."
Then on June 5, in Jakarta, Virando went out as he spoke with Time magazine and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said "everything will be settled according to law."
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verando for "anti-human rights crimes" in the bloody 1999 East Timor independence vote, but he said that 11 human rights violations in the Papua region had been resolved, including Paniyeh.
The family of the victims of the Paniyeh incident scorned these statements.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed at all."
Years later he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I am afraid to be arrested by the army and feared to be shot."
His brother, Yucabus, also believed that Paniyeh's people were terribly afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, "After the body was buried, the military came to find me."
The gunshot didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Panai neighborhood of Deyai County.
A construction company manager who refused to help transport a coma man to the hospital clashed on both sides, one died and 17 others were injured, including children.
24-year-old Ravianus Dowoo drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's on-site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warnings.
But the anti-riot mobile force (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at a crowd, one of whom was killed.
Doming Valley Buddy, 29, told Time magazine that "we were all panicked at the time and now feared they would be retaliation." He lived near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being sent to the hospital in a hurry.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The parliament has called for bringing the police involved to justice and evacuating anti-riot mobile forces from the area.
Panai has always been a non-existent place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fueled the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered across the lush central highlands of Paniyeh.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by dispersing attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papuan movement were born in Panay, including Tadius Yugi and Daniel Udas Kogoya.
Thus, in recent years thousands of Panai have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of "maintaining national sovereignty."
Some have never appeared again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Panay is a "forgotten tragedy."
Poverty breeds discontent.
The rice sold by Anarotali is poor, and the locals can't afford it at all.
The bread is far away.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly red potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can take care of four or five slices of red potatoes.
They usually use most of the harvest to retain writers, and the rest are placed on local markets for sale.
Ten slices of red potatoes are worth 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has shed light on local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of a new route to Nabire airport.
The small amount of work currently available is usually in the hands of better educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or necessary skills to run competitive companies.
John Goba, chairman of the Panai Tribal Council, said: "Young people don't want to stay in this village...because there is no job or money here."
Papua is inseparable from the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan were deported to Papua because they "didn't work with the relevant agencies," even though they had rarely obtained permission for shooting.
According to Felim Kan, Asia's deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Zokovi's waiver of reporting restrictions for transparency and development has not been achieved.
He said in a statement that "if foreign journalists try to report on Indonesia's most eastern discontent provinces, Papua and West Papua, they have new risks: denial of visas and blacklisting."
The lack of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "all kinds of general human rights violations" in Papua, including the Paniyeh shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papuan movement.
Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman, Almannata Najil, dissatisfied with the group's allegations and told a reporter in Jakarta that "the evidence of human rights violations is difficult to hide as it continues to operate democratic institutions and freedom of the media."
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
On May 4, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Keith Van Bar led an official delegation to Chayapla, the local people broke their silence and lamented that "we want freedom."
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Zokovi again.
The chairman of the tribal council, Gobai, said that "Zokovi's intention was good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Paniyeh shooting."
He wanted to let Jokowi know that the people of Panay live not only under the threat of greedy armies, but also without anything, with little education in the region and lack of public health services.
Gobai said the Panay people, like other Papuans, believed that their vote for Jokowi was a debt he had to pay.
"They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniyeh shooting continued to resist their last symbolic resistance: burying a victim's body opposite that military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let those culprits forget their crimes.
Yucabus lowered his head and said, "My family was killed."

Sophie, good caterers, top-solid and other brands relying on capital force to customize the home industry. On February 10, 2017, the Chinese SFC approved the first application of Guangdong Xiangfeng Home Appliances Co., Ltd., issued a deep trading floor small and medium board listing pass, after more than 20 days European family just adopted the initial IPO.
Industry insiders believe that with the subsequent listing of fashionable housing and European family, the custom home area that was originally in the vortex will shift from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, a typical representative of the brand's fashionable home set will be announced in the field of custom homes, attracting the attention of the entire home industry.
Samsung Electronics on Tuesday released the first set of self-driving vehicle components, together with Harman International, as well as infotainment solutions, an important step in the company's entry into the automotive electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired Hamman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released car cameras with collision alerts, lane drift alerts and cruise control features that were developed in collaboration with Hamman.
Samsung plans to begin the delivery of this camera system this year, which is built in machine learning and augmented reality such as technology.
Samsung also shows the "digital cockpit", even if the driver is not the owner, it can make the vehicle more personal characteristics, because this system allows users to download the driver's information from mobile devices and the cloud.

The fire once again swallowed Dubai's "torch" skyscraper
On Friday, a fire broke out in Dubai, one of the world's tallest residential buildings, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337 meters high, 79-storey superhigh building.
This was the second fire that sweeped high-rise buildings in just two years, and happened to be a skyscraper called "the Torch".
The building has been evacuated and no reports of injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been identified.
"We're sleeping and then we wake up with fire alarms, people start screaming."
"We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said the fire brigade extinguished the fire at around 4 p.m. local time (Greenwich Standard Time 0,000) and is working on cooling for the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelters for affected people.
The incident could rekindle concerns around the world about the safety of external materials used in high-rise buildings.
A survey carried out by Sky Tower management after the 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were covered wall panels for decoration and insulation.
British police have said they believe that the problem with the insulation and cladding system of the London Grenfeld building could be the reason for the rapid spread of fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams' team also hinted that Masa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.
On January 9, just a month before the opening of the Korean Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, with the transmission of preheating from south to north and preparations vigorously carried out, the climate of the winter Olympic Games in South Korea is becoming stronger.
South Korea's public opinion expects this long-running North Korean talks to bring a "hairy egg" for one month of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics countdown.
On November 1 last year, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics fire arrived in South Korea.
The hot flash of the fire directly reflected on ticket sales at Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just more than two months ago, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ticket sales rate was only hovering at 32%, the winter Paralympic tickets sales rate was only 4.3%, and the low ticket sales rate once caused the outside world to worry about the popularity of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
But as Chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee Li Xifan recently predicted to reporters, "With the blazes passing through all parts of South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympic Games is increasing and believes that ticket sales will soon improve."
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic tickets sales have reached 64%, and the winter Paralympic ticket sales rate has also exceeded 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to visit the Korean Games, the South Korean Ministry of Legal Affairs also announced on 8th that it will extend the stay in Korea for foreigners visiting and watching the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games with a maximum duration of 120 days.
Survey finds more than one in five U.S. travellers carrying prohibited items on board
A survey of plane passengers found that more than 20% of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally strapped illegal goods through the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, and at least 6% of those who did not deliberately carry prohibited knives or other cutting-edge items on board.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed they had found a misguided journey with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people was carried out by charter service firm Stratos Jet Charters Inc. and found that young travelers were more likely to ignore the regulations in flagranteum.
19.7% of those who admitted to trying to deliberately carry TSA banned items on board were millennials, compared with less than 15% of the X-generation population.
The most common items intentionally slipping through TSA security inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3% of respondents admitted to having intentionally carried a safety check with the edges, while 2.2% of female and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on board.
The company said the survey of national travelers was conducted to understand the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargoed items on board aircraft.
Not surprisingly, the people who are most likely to pass security checks with embargoes - intentionally or unintentionally - are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guide is a bit complex and incomprehensible.
People are usually not sure what and how many liquids they can carry.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the TSA captured the most contraband liquids.
At one point, it was thought that the TSA might also use books as an embargo.
Domestic flights allow carrying liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry.
U.S. environmental director Pruitt changed his mind about Obama-era regulations on emissions reductions
After a day of indictment in 15 states, the Commissioner for Environmental Protection Scott Pruitt changed his decision to postpone earlier implementation of the Obama-era regulations on reducing emissions from smoke pollutants.
Prout proposed this change because, compared to previous governments, the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not refer to the legal challenges posed by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The dispute is focused on setting the 1st October deadline for states to begin meeting ground-level ozone standards in 2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay his implementation for a year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decision-making or hindering economic growth."
Before being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruit was the Oklahoma Attorney General who had long opposed stricting environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industry opposes.
The abrupt reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal impediment to Pruitt's regulatory return on the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Commissioner for Environmental Protection exceeded his authority and tried to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's regulations requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Pruitt made a big turnaround in his attitude toward ozone standards, saying he would strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to work with states and take complex procedures to reach new standards.
"Under previous government administrations, the Environmental Protection Agency usually fails to meet a specified deadline and then waits for militant groups and others to sue them before agreeing to establish a designated timetable through an agreement," Pruitt said.
"We don't believe in the regulation carried out through litigation and we take deadlines seriously."
We also take the regulations and authorities seriously."
Still, the Environmental Protection Agency's statement said that Pruitt may again use his "deferred authorization and all other lawfully available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions are in line with "good policies and best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wide-ranging rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill, which was approved last month, aims to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has led the states' coalition to sue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's reversal - after we filed a lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smoke emissions."
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia joined in this case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by common pollutants emitted from automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources that react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists are cheering for Plut's surprising transformation.
Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biodiversity said: "It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under tremendous pressure from the heads of departments who protect the air we need to breathe."
"We must fight to the end with the Trump administration's ideological movement that caters to polluters and special interests."

Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshan flowerwood sales volume (the amount) has maintained a high trend, especially this spring, Xiaoshan seedlings sales have hit a record high, sales increase and prices rise, according to statistics, this year from January to June in Xiaoshan achieve semen sales revenue increased by 48% compared with the same period last year, the growth rate is nearly 20 years.
Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau Deputy Director Shi Haijun said that with the good sales situation, Xiaoshan flowerwood production has also achieved a faster development.
In the past two years, Xiaoshan flower cultivation area has expanded to 30,000 acres, and the total area has reached 180,000 acres; while actively developing outside the region, Xiaoshan Miaonan built a flower base of 80,000 acres across the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In addition to expanding the area of cultivation, the quality of seedlings has also been continuously improved, the value of nursery and nursery stores has been constantly improving, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained more, and some seeds have become unprofitable.
Schhai Yong also reminds that in the face of the current booming picture of production and sales, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze, both to see the social demand for flowerwood will be long-term, increasing, but also to recognize that market competition will be more fierce.
On the morning of July 13, United States Somaltus filed a lawsuit with the East Texas District Court alleging Apple's violation of a patent for battery technology that it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba with the same patents.
The lawsuit claims that both the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed U.S. Patent No. 7,657,386, which was named Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff sought cash compensation or a patent fee for infringing equipment after the verdict was announced.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiffs seem to believe that the iPhone's fastcharging function infringed on the company's patents.
iPhones with fast charging will quickly charge up to 80% of the electricity and then trickle it.
Somaltus is actually a so-called "patent rogue" because the company doesn't offer obvious products and services, and it's hard to find relevant information online.
However, they have successfully reached an out-of-court settlement on the patent with automakers such as Ford and Nissan.
The meeting believes that accelerating the development of informationization, promoting the integration of resources and efficient use, improving the digitalization and intelligentization of the industry, is important to promote "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, many innovation, nurture new energy, improve the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for border wall construction
The Washington Post leaked a record of calls between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with his public blasting of the wall, and Mr. Putron allegedly told him: "Don't tell the media."
Trump pledged to build the wall on the southern border of the United States during his presidential campaign and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
The record of the call between him and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published, which showed strained exchanges between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. take on a deal to repatriate refugees to Australia was "absurd", "nasty" and "silly," which he had recommended for the U.S. to ban resettlement of refugees, while now sticking to a deal under the Obama administration's good offices would make him look like a "fool."
Trump hung the phone after telling Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call today."

Moore Beach Tragedy: Actors Repeated Racist Purges and Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car passed through a group of entourage in the town of Menro, Georgia, and ran thronging towards the small Moore Beach Bridge.
There were four black passengers and a white driver on the car, which blocked the road to advance by a group of gunned whites before they arrived at the bridge.
The thug's head - a middle-aged man dressed in fine stripes - sucked a cigar deep and his eyes glanced into the windshield.
Passengers in the car are full of fear.
"We want - Roger!" cried the man.
"Take him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the front passenger seat, screaming piercing silence.
Luckily, this horrific scene on July 22 is just a remake.
But when the "Roger" neck sleeves, almost all of the entourage viewers gave a real breath.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore Beach Bridge and recreate the scene of two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Markon as well as George and Merrey Dossey - who were hanged by three K parties in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"While we know who they are, and although we've seen them in the community, none of them have been arrested over the years, which is unbelievable," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this replay.
"This is a stain of history, the burden of our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia lawmaker and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the replay is a striking call to remind people in Menro's community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we have justice, we will not be cured or reconciled."
On July 27, 1946, the coroner placed sheets on a corpse of a Mor Beach lynching victim.
According to FBI files obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation, more than 50 men from Menro and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in lynchings.
None of them were indicted.
While the number of suspects has been at large for a decade, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation to commit lynching is well-known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote in the primaries for the first time later that summer.
According to FBI statistics, around the same time, black tenant Roger Malcolm strangled white landowner Barnet Hearst in a fight - looking like it was for a woman.
Brooks said the town's rumors were that Herst had been sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby was not her husband's.
On July 25, 1946, famed white landlord Loy Harrison spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousins, Mac Murray and George Dorsey, accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from prison, quickly to the Moore Beach Bridge, a group of lynching mobs surrounded the car.
"It turned out that it was Harrison who organized and ordered the execution of this murder," a FBI report concluded.
"It's clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, which not only involved in murder, destroyed evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is very concise.
He said, "It's a right-to-vote tragedy."
"They were tragically killed and the killers sent messages to black people in this community: 'If you register and vote, you will also have the same ending.'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for the annual remake of the lynching tragedy at Moore Beach Bridge.
Her portrayal was clear, concise and with a deep racist background. Many hoped that racism would no longer exist in the United States.
Look hard, not look harder, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because it makes us face the ugly faces of all," she said.
"But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't hear me talk about my own experiences, I can't have a relationship with you."
This year's show began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - more than a dozen white people, the rest black - were squeezed into a room to listen to Greene's rehearsal.
Wade Malbau was the co-director of Green.
He has played the role of three K parties for many years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel very dirty because I'm not such a person," Malbo said.
"But I think it's important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that era."
In the room, acting as Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hearst Actors Darios Bradshaw and Nick Rascona rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm shouted and pushed out Herst, angered him by sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my field!"
Rascona hurled back.
Then they slapped.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Greens laughed the most.
"What's wrong?" asked Rascona.
He was panicked and confused.
Did I play too much?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just think white people won't say 'Ah' when they fight back."
"Yes," another black actor teased.
"Your tone must be tough."
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of friendship drove off discomfort.
Everyone is trying to do this not only to perform the show, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene started again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "Ah", the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughed.
The replay ended vigorously and quickly.
The screaming, the shootings, and then it was a silence.
A woman in a black coat of funerals stood by the actor's body and sang Billy Hardee's mournful words, "Strange Fruits."
Her voice overwhelmed other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping their sweats and tears.
Blacks and whites accounted for almost half of the audience.
One couple took part in the show from Isaica, New York, and many others lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the burial grounds of Malcolm and Dorothy for nearly eight hours, all endured Georgia's disgusting wet heat.
But now, standing on the same piece of land where lynching took place, there was a lot of anxiety in the air.
When the final notes of the song vanish, Green asked people to come close to check out the bodies played by the actor.
The children leaned down and looked at the fake blood and bodies, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy muttered, as if reminding himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor threw off the lynching rope and wiped his tears.
Bradshaw embraces the costumed man Marbau, who plays the three-K party head.
Nick Rascona embraced his two colleagues, crying silently in their arms; the emotion of the performance eventually infected him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispered.
"We know that your heart is not like this.
You do this for a reason."
Afterwards, the audience sat down and dinnerd with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they just met to talk about replays.
Denise Dupinski found it difficult to find a word that describes how she felt after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those horrible words and actions... that people like you are saying, doing, because they look very much like you," she said.
"It really made me think that the lynching was still going on for me," she added, "and now this kind of thing is only called police shooting."
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table to watch, tasting and reciting civil rights.
He said he had already started planning for the next year's show.
"Replaying is an inspiring way because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
"If you don't learn from it, this may happen again."
Those who do not study and do not understand their own history are destined to repeat the same."
The importance of the reform on "net independence" in terms of gas marketization reforms is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
Reporter from Hebei Kai Luan Group learned on the 7th, at 11:25 a.m. in Kayulan Group Chemical Co., Ltd. emulsification workshop in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, an explosion occurred and 13 operational personnel were trapped there.
As of now, one of the 13 trapped people has been rescued, emergency hospital rescued, and the remaining 12 are in intensive search and rescue.
It is understood that at present the site has been blocked, and local public security, firefighting, medical and other departments are on-site rescue.
According to eyewitnesses, the incident was a loud bang, and in a moment a mushroom cloud became empty.

Chinese Air Force Engineering University Scientists Study Laser Satellites for Clearing Space Traffic
Chinese scientists have put forward a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the turbulent Earth orbit, destroying old satellites and their sky rubbish.
According to the U.S. Newsweek website on January 15, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper entitled Space-based laser removal model for small scale space debris drifting that describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers using space-based platform lasers into smaller and less harmful pieces.
Space debris has been a matter of concern to the International Space Agency for many years, with NASA considering multiple options to track, detect and remove man-made debris.
The means of removing large-scale space debris include the massive nets used to purify and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted a laser simulation study which concluded that this would be an effective way to clear Earth's orbit.
The abstract of the paper states: "(emulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser debris removal technology."
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats per day for satellites running along the orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts from the European Space Agency as "a deadly set of threats".
According to the U.S. magazine Volkswagen Machinery website on January 17, space is basically empty, but it's becoming more and more crowded in space next to Earth. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and these pieces will accumulate over time.
The more debris the more likely a satellite is still in operation to be smashed by debris, causing damage or destruction to an investment worth millions of dollars.
All space agencies have plans to clear space junk in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of debris by spraying gas to get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large network that captures debris and brings them back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to catch fragments with an electric chain.
Right now, China has also proposed a solution to the problem of space junk by hitting floating space junk into less harmful small pieces with a large laser.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in Germany's Optics Monthly, installing such a laser on a satellite would clean up space efficiently enough, at least based on simulation results.
The only way to prove the validity is testing, and there are no arrangements for such missions at this time, but perhaps sooner or later people will install lasers on a satellite and send them into space.
Once that's done, we can finally start eradicating the problem of space junk once and for all.

Pesan Group rescinded 3,000 jobs and sharply cut dividends to revive operations
Britain's education group, Baerson Group, said Friday that it would rescind 3,000 jobs and significantly cut its mid-term dividend by 72 percent because it had started another restructuring project to cope with business pressure.
Chief Executive John Fowling said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, with a reduction of 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pessan Group announced plans to cut another PS300m ($394 million) in its third cost-cutting project to revive businesses affected by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Betasman and published a report that floated 1 percent of its base sales to PS2.05bn in the first half of the year, but said the outlook for this year remains unchanged.
A few days ago, China's Tianzhou Association made a serious and serious announcement to stifle the running phenomenon and was prepared to impose heavy penalties on violators for lifelong bans.
The convoy in Kabul was killed by a suicide bomb attack on NATO soldiers
According to official news, a military convoy was hit by suicide bombers in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several people.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were stabbed.
According to unsubstantiated local reports, three civilians also died during the incident in the city's Karabagh district.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - a bombing of the Herat mosque on Tuesday killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to the NATO statement, an explosion occurred on Thursday night and joint Afghan and NATO patrols were hit by "personally carrying improvised explosive devices".
The statement said that all the injured are currently in stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital located at Bagram Air Force Base.
The growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) groups in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Baghram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, while the capital accounted for about 20%.
At least 30 people were killed by a suicide car bomb attack in the Shiite-dominated area of Kabul at the end of July.
The Taliban claimed they had launched the attack.
On 31 May, a massive explosion in downtown Kabul killed more than 150 people, the deadliest attack on the country since the U.S.-led multinational force overthrew the Taliban in 2001.

Macki Garcia and Vassil Lomachenko met for the first time to discuss possible future decisive battles
The most striking boxing match below 147 pounds will be held shortly after, with Vasili Lomachenko and Macki Garcia meeting for the first time on Thursday in a state of potential conflict.
In their separate room in the Los Angeles ESPN office, unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the corridor and saluted world boxing organization ultra-featherweight champion Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing tournament held on Saturday, the referees unanimously determined that Garcia defeated four-tier world champion Adrian Brona to win, and both of them became the top five players in the heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "Championage, hello?"
Good luck to you."
During the ESPN race at 7 p.m. on Saturday night, Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga and retained his position.
When they took two pictures, Lomanchenko's broker, Agis Clemas, pointed out that the potential match between the two players depends on "perfect size."
"I was lightweight before," Garciati said.
"I'm upgraded to fight Brona (140 pounds), but I don't have that big weight.
Compared to 140 pounds, my weight is still low.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he has to reach a lightweight (135 pounds) before we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we will satisfy them."
Lomachenko agrees with this.
"The boxing community needs this fight."
Callimas asked if he should be charged at the expense, and part of his strategy was that Lomachenko had to make a debut with a 135-pound player later this year for a date next summer with Garcia (37 - 0, 30 knockouts). Gasia is also interested in confronting the winner of the battle with Jorge Linares-Luc Campbell after the Forum's lightweight boxer race on September 23.
"As all fans are asking this question, the battle may be charged on a sequential basis," Garcia said. Afterwards, he expressed openness to the game in the network that provides the best financial program.
"We are the main characters.
Others can't have such a great deal of attention.
"As long as they are ready..."
Garcia applauded Lomachenko as a "excellent player" and probably watched his Saturday boxing game live.
But Lomachenko hesitated over Garcia's praise, saying he thought the three-tiered champion from Riverside looked "slow."
Garcia said the focus was to show the power of boxing, and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing game.
"This is a war that must be waged,
Attention and enthusiasm are beyond the reach of other boxing games.
I am very happy to participate," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top warriors, this time it's Mackie's turn.
It will be a great battle."

Adding to the gradual end of energy saving and emission reductions, by December 15, most steel mills will be basically remanufactured, and products will continue to reach local markets before New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will cause a certain pressure on the price of steel that is currently prospering.

The latest results of the age-assessment test for asylum seekers in Sweden are published
The Swedish asylum test used the latest method to medically assess their age, and the latest results showed that more than 80% of subjects were sentenced to over 18 years old, but not all believed in its accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R.ttsmedinalverket) started the test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some alleged underage refugees, the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to making more accurate age assessments during asylum.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Service has sent 6,880 testers and the Forensic Medical Center has published results of a total of 2,481 testers between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were sentenced to age 18 or above, but in another 25 trials, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that subjects "may have reached the age of 18 or more".
In 432 trials, the result was that the person "may not have reached the age of 18".
Tests are only for people with doubtful age.
According to John Grahamson, the forensics center, these results are consistent with those of previous months.
He told The Local: "These data are not so much different from those of the last few months, and both numbers are very consistent."
A higher proportion of cases found to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that these asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the center published 581 test results and said there were 442 cases "showing that this participant has reached the age of 18 or older."
Newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed 581 test results and found that 243 of the participants had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
X-ray examinations of mental teeth, nuclear magnetic resonance scanning of joints and then analysis by dentists and radiologists are also questioned in some areas.
One of the suspects was Caroline College endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work included assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they experienced adolescence earlier or later than their normal age.
He told Newspaper Metro: "I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurement method used should be that.
In this way, the determination of physiological age is very inaccurate.
"If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it."
However, Grantson of the Forensic Medical Center defended the accuracy of these tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small."
The biggest risk is that the person is just under 18, which accounts for about 10%.
Governor of West Virginia announces party change
Thursday night, West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced at President Trump's rally that he would change the party.
"Like it, don't like it, Democrats have left me," the governor said.
"Today, after many prayers and a lot of thought I will tell you... today I will tell you as West Virginians that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democratic Party."
There was a cheering out of the rally.
"So tomorrow, I'm going to turn the party into a Republican," Justines added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another game."
Trump earlier pledged to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won a 42% voter turnout in West Virginia, and Justine did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was named the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes notes that he inherited his father's coal industry and owned coal mines in all five states.
Currently, he is worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying: "Governor Justin's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, not only does it prevent our country from becoming great again but will make our country great again."
"The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the lowest number of state councils, and Governor Justin's statement is the latest rejection of a party that loses leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan," Republican National Committee chairwoman Rona McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Ko praised Russia's "open" apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletics Federation Sebastian Co praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal and said it was "open," but he reiterated that it wasn't time for Russia to rejoin the campaign.
Athletics Federation President Mitri Chiracdin said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that his country was right to be barred from participating in the campaign and he resolved to fight stimulants.
He said he regretted that "all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the race were stripped of medals."
Despite such comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban. Previously, evidence of Russian state-sponsored use of doping was found in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which was implemented in November 2015.
"I think today's response is very frank and very candid," IAAF Chairman Ko told reporters.
"The entire Council and the IAAF General Assembly are delighted... The Russian Federation acknowledges that it has experienced a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can re-enter the game."
Co said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entering.
"I think this is a very constructive day and I also believe we've made some progress, but the IAAF supports the panel's recommendations and it's not time to regain Russian qualifying," Ko said.
"We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize this situation."
Our guiding principle has always been to isolate innocuous athletes from contaminated systems," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of IAAF and will compete as neutral at the World Athletics Championships held in London on Friday.
Jun Anderson, head of the IAAF ad hoc panel, said on Monday that Russia has not met a number of criteria for re-entering the competition.
After a speech to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and banned trainers were still coaching.

How did the financial rules of the football community affect Neymar's transfer to Paris?
Rules designed to prevent Eurogaming from being unrestricted spending will not impede Neymar's transfer from Barcelona Club in Spain to Paris St. Germain Football Club (PSG) in France at a record price.
The European Football Association League (UEFA) has further degraded the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, which is the governing body of Europa's football game and has the right to ban all teams from participating in the well-known Champions League.
The 2011 FIFA Financial Fair Race Rules (FFP) meant that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club would eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without causing huge losses.
Barcelona Club has already paid EUR222 million ($262 million) just to pay for the Brazilian player's denunciation, and Neymar's salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar's transfer to France.
Considering that the team's money comes from a bustling Qatari ruling family, Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can of course sign Neymar with cash and incorporate him into other star crowded teams.
Clubs can spend a lot of money buying players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amount of money that is being spent and enable them to achieve profit-loss balance in football's related business.
The Rules for the Financial Fair Race were conceived by Michel Platini after being elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs with high debt to pursue success, if the bank or everyone withdraws support funds, they are actually deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the Rules' focus shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired Chelsea in 2003, namely buying a potential club and then spending huge sums to improve the team and build a global brand, is now facing even more demanding situations.
During the three-year rule assessment period as of 2018, the club may lose EUR30 million.
Although Abu was denigrated by his current president in 2015, UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin remains committed to stopping overexpenditure.
"Of course the Rules are not invalid, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations," Andrea Traverso, UEFA's responsible for rules related matters, told the Associated Press last week.
While the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay a lump sum to Neymar's purchase terms, it can also distribute amounts for accounting purposes within the contract term.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee may be shown as EUR44.4 million in its annual account for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions imposed in 2014 put the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the Manchester City club under Abu Dhabi on the toughest.
The Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined 60 million euros ($82 million at the current exchange rate), later reduced to 20 million euros, and demanded that in the Champions League of the 2014-15 season this team reduce players to 21 instead of a normal 25 player.
UEFA is staring intently at clubs that try to increase revenues by pegging with club owners and deceiving financial regulators.
While Qatar's companies can sponsor Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, if the amount of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, then UEFA will not view it as a legitimate income.
This was what happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the amount of Qatar's tourism agency sponsored the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was overstated.
A portion of Neymar's revenue from the St. Germain Football Club in Paris is likely to come from payments by the Qatar World Cup Organising Committee in 2022.
However, both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied Neymar would serve as a World Cup ambassador, and it was easy for UEFA regulators to take such an initiative.
The recent sanctions against the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club mean that UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, people familiar with the news said that UEFA did not have a pre-discussion with Paris Saint-Germain Football Club on the transfer of Neymar.
The above-mentioned individuals have only contacted the Associated Press in an unnamed manner because they are not authorized to discuss the status of San Jerman Football Club in Paris.
The last published accounts showed that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club operating income in 2015-16 was EUR 542.4 million, earning more than EUR 10 million.
Accounts for the previous accounting year have not yet been disclosed.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar's accession to bring the gospel for sponsorship activities, franchising and jersey sales.
The club expects revenue to grow by at least 30 percent after signing in Neymar.
Obviously, seeing one of the most famous players left, the Spanish League was deeply furious in trying to block Neymar's move and claimed that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violated the rules.
The Premier League president, Harvey Tabbas, told the Spanish newspaper AS that "this is an obvious example of a 'financial stimulant' and both clubs and countries are the same," referring to Qatar, which has final ownership of Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsenal team manager Arsene Wenger (all of the club are American sports tycoons) has reservations about state-funded clubs and La Liga.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has revolutionized the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Once the country has a club, everything will happen.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, as there are many different ways or interests for a country to require big players to represent a country."

It is based on the story of King Liu An, Hande Huainan in China's traditional culture and stemmed from the tradition of "Leo Am making tofu, made by mistake", which tells the story of the protagonist "tofu" with a bean illuminated adult shape, overcome difficulties and adhere to the dream of fairy.

Nostalgic infecting the market - Halley Summer Camp and Detective Twins
The story is recounted in order to miss the actor's 1980s and the garbage era of the 1990s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Schwart produced a sketch comedy for MTV), as well as the nostalgia itself, the memory of 2001; before that year many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Luther had not yet been born.
As a cultural artifact, it is an imitation and embodiment of our eternal memories of the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
The first day of the camp resonated strongly after airing, but it wasn't just because of its absurd humor (the plot is an original story about a talking vegetable canned, voiced by H.J. Benjamin).
Redoubles the use of core laughter - middle-aged actors acting as children who are in a bad age - which makes it possible not to get back into the past and is also part of fun.
In 10 Years Later, adults actually play adult, the emotions are not too deep-rooted and imitation is more widespread, including improvisations to track movies in the 1990s, such as "The Hand that Moves the Cradle."
At some point, a character is trapped in an Apple notebook, some straight skating shoes and "Something else in 1991."
Many core stories are the same.
Sweetheart (Mr. Chewart) is now a novelist, but he still does not forget Katie (Margaret Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still retains the body of a man.
There is another intriguing plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Schwart), inspired by George H.W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressed).
As always, the best part of this series is interlude.
Especially interesting to see this ever-young Mr. Luther, who shows Matt Diron's soul patch in the film Single Nobility, and Andy of the previous Campus Giant now feels like a giant.
It's a randomly crazy moment that could power the film, like the recursive Seven Years of Life series, until I think it's logical to conclude: The Harley Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later, its final scene is for this Cass to watch the premiere of the Harley Summer Camp.
At the same time, Amazon's "Detective Duo" talks about different nostalgia content: Cold War renaissance American Dreams, movie The City of Severe Cold and even GLOW: A gorgeous women's wrestling alliance.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatwood and Alexandro Dina, was pushed on the television screen by director Reese Thomas: It's a difficult brother-in-law comedy set in Romania in the 1980s that tells the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and Marxian-Leninist lines.
The main characters - hardcore Grigor and idealist Etherf - were played by little Florin Piersci and Cornerius Ulich, respectively, whose dialogue was voiced in English by Channing Tatum (also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
This is a marvellous idea.
But it's not just an idea.
There are some good visual gimmicks (the police watch chess on the TV and send time because Americans like to play football).
And a number of celebrity voice actors - including Jenny Srett, Nick Overman, Mahsharah-Hashbaz Ali and Collo Sevini - have created a wonderful sound show.
But Detective Twins is so committed to creating a raucous and realistic propaganda comedy - in which there is a killer with a Reagan mask - and it usually plays that role.
This six-piece long TV is slightly dragged, and the comedy effect releases are not fast or frequent.
The length of the film was more rigorous, and when Gregor and Etherf repeatedly visited the U.S. Embassy, it showed better incitement to irony, as there were always two fat people in the lobby of the embassy swallowing up a bunch of hamburgers.

The reporter recently learned that the benefits of steel, rail transportation, ships, machinery manufacturing and other industries in the Northeast region generally declined, and even there were losses.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, a new round of revitalization of Northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but will also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust transformation.
The general decline in corporate benefits of traditional industries, the real loss of raw materials, industrial and heavy-duty machinery and equipment manufacturing benefits seriously fell or even appeared losses, is the first performance of the Northeast industry in this round of economic downturn.
In the past in the economic downturn, mainly low-end and primary products are hit by large characteristics, but during this economic fluctuation, Northeast traditional industrial high-end and low-end industrial products have been affected.
Sang Steel Group (Weibo) began to adjust the product structure in previous years, focusing on developing high-end plates such as container boards, steel rails, boatboards and civil household appliances plate, but this year sales of these varieties have been significantly reduced, especially shipboard sales fell 50% from the same period last year.
Saan steel shares (Hao Qing Shun, Director of Metallurgy Branch of the Liaoning Industry and Information Technology Commission, said that metallurgy is the third pillar industry in Liaoning, with an annual output of 60 million tons of steel production capacity ranked third in the country.
In January-May this year, 21.54 million tons of crude steel production in Liaoning province, the national policy encouragement and strong local government construction projects demand better product production and sales situation, more intense market competition products decrease significantly, is another characteristic of Northeast manufacturing industry.

Bank of England to maintain 0.25% interest rate
Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have stifled the upward trend.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be "weak" as it tightens household income and controls interest rates.
Policymakers at the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain interest rates of 0.25% by a vote of 6-2, while a handful of members this month called for an increase in interest rates even though weaker economic growth has diminished the boost from upsizing.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England narrowed growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that austerity in household income will continue while inflation will surge to nearly 3% in the fall.
But it said that over the next few years, interest rates will need to be raised to curb inflation brought about by Brexit, while borrowing costs may require a much higher hike expected in financial markets.
A year ago, a large-scale economic promotion policy was implemented under the influence of Brexit, and members voted to withdraw it.
Bank of England will announce the suspension of its regular financing plan, starting next February to provide cheap money for banks, although the bank says it currently needs an additional 15 billion pounds on a PS115 billion basis.
In the record of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England said: "In MPC's core projections, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near future as real household income tightening will continue to dampen consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated that there is a need for "a certain monetary policy tightening" to crack down on inflation and an "greater degree" than market expectations.
Currently, the market is expected to achieve its first growth in the third quarter of next year and a second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any upsurge would be "slow" and "restraint."
Growth forecasts for the bank this year and next year are declining, compared to May's projections of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank maintained a 1.8% growth forecast for 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound against the United States dollar declined, and the euro followed closely.
The pound fell 0.5% against the U.S. dollar to 1.31 and 0.4% against the euro to 1.11.
Before the unaltered decision came to light, increasing upward expectations were eroded by recent inconclusive growth data. GDP increased to 0.3% in the second quarter compared with only 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3 percent, although it will grow slightly by the end of the year.
The average household was hit by inflationary surges and wage growth was negligible, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report did not give them a good news because it said that tightening would get worse before it improved.
Monetary policy "cannot prevent" the blow to income over the next few years, but wages are expected to "massively" recover by the end of three-year forecasts.
At the same time, as the pound depreciates and demand for British goods grows sharply, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the low consumption.
The year prior to the decision-making, a shocking EU referendum plunged the pound and lowered interest rates to 0.25 percent in August.
Bank of England estimated it would take four years to fully impact prices and the British economy.
Before the bank released its latest interest rate decision, the call for an increase in interest rates was unanswered, as inflation aggravated ordinary households that had long been stressed, while three policymakers called for a hike of interest rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said it was expected and would rise again over the next few months.
The line says that, relative to its 2% target, the excess portion is already completely the final bottom line of the weaker GBP.
Andrew Montrecker, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market appears to be becoming more competitive once again as lenders strongly call for more businesses and look forward to putting a perfect pronoun this year.
For those who may be about to close existing deals, such a market looks particularly favorable as remortgage (many of which are exempt from fees and low interest rates) is increasingly popular.

The UK's National Health Service (NHS) disputed HIV drug lights
After the decision of the high court on drug funding for NHS, patients will be able to receive "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England has announced that pre-exposure preventive drugs (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual intercourse, have been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86 percent. Now health services will deliver it to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year supported the High Court's ruling, which stated that although NHS claims local authorities should finance the drug, it has the right to pay for PrEP.
The move announced Thursday was called a "major new intervention" by British NHS CEO Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "critical moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will become the first sex health clinics to be registered with people. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure Preventive Drugs (PrEP) is an HIV drug used before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments show that PrEP can significantly reduce the transmission of HIV in people at risk.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This drug can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual men, transgender individuals and unsuccessful HIV-positive people.
The clinic will identify eligible and agreeable participants in the trial, including men, women, transgender people and undisclosed individuals whose HIV status is infected with antiretroviral therapy.
Those who live and register with a general practitioner in England can also enroll at their local sexual health clinics.
The plan will cost PS10m, and the NHS England branch signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after conducting international competitive procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is positioned, absorbed and implemented based on large samples.
Mr Stevens said: "This significant new intervention should complement and strengthen the prevention of HIV in a broad and increasingly successful manner.
This is another milestone in action worth more than 30 years to achieve progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind."
Dipolia King, CEO of the UK Trust Fund for AIDS (NAT), said: "This is a crucial moment to fight AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prevention drugs provide a possibility to change the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-risk population will be given an approved new tool through a NHS-funded trial in England that is truly self-executable without consultation with sexual partners which will improve the lives of many people.
We support this announcement with our hands."
"The top priority now is to ensure that trials are quickly pushed across the country and that none of the HIV-infected people can fall."
Now that we have purchased PrEP test drugs, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV."
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "After months of delays and government dragging, the beginning of PrEP's initial trial was popular and should have arrived earlier."
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This test will allow us to further and fully understand the advantages of PrEP.
It is important now to launch this trial at the national level as soon as possible in order to protect people exposed to HIV and help us further end the spread of HIV in society."

Quality of life: Applying lofts and clever design to make Count Palace apartments a spacious home
Joanne Ray was once a banker and she was passionate about renovating the house, and in 2014 she moved from the big house on the Knights Bridge to the Countess House apartment.
This apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - Joanne didn't pack up and sell it for sale, which is a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before that, I and my ex-boyfriend lived in a larger house at the Knights Bridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for the right house to offer.
I saw this apartment in the Countial Palace, and its ceilings were also high.
I am very happy to make a offer that day."
Since the first houseview, this 1,000 square foot apartment has now completed a thorough renovation.
This apartment was originally a complex one-room layout - which needed to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanne wanted to add storage space and lofts to make full use of the high ceiling.
"I want high ceilings, big windows, and plenty of light.
That's my request," she said.
To this end, she hired Elvan Azadi from Duck&Shed's architecture and design studio (located in Notting Hill) to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to create a home that was not only a development project but also where Joanne lived.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the building challenge is to create a loft that is high enough for standing.
Elfan must play creative thinking in order to solve this problem.
"The steel structure is quite complex," he explained.
"We have to arrange space for it to appear up and down, and we don't need to shake shoulder bows back."
"It's not just as simple to build a simple platform, but also to start these steels in order to make them at the right level of implementation."
Through this arrangement, Elfan is able to get two fully tall rooms in the space - which can add many interesting elements.
The attic, with retro bronze windows of the Retrouvius brand, overlooks fascinating living areas.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver little piece of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid the overall style.
Use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Set a mirror on both ends of the short hallway, which can make it look longer.
In the kitchen, a splash-proof plate with mirrors is like a window that leads to another room.
At the vantage point, a small set of mirrors provides Joanne with storage space for storing tableware and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an intriguing sense of space, which can be picked up when the kitchen is not used.
The folding kitchen is not fresh.
But the unique feature of this folding kitchen is a garage-style lift door.
"This involves knowledge in some engineering fields," Elfan explains the reinforced cemented MDF door.
"This is a balancing principle, so it's easy to slide when you push the door."
Thanks to the skillful use of space and storage, Joanne gets an extra 16 square meters, more than one bedroom, and improved layout.
"Ultimately, what you're selling is the size of a house - or your valuation is based on the size of that house," Elfan said.
"Basically, real estate agents go into the room and compute according to the size of the floor."
They will manage to increase the space footprint while using high-quality materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to this space.
Elfan said, "The material is all you personally choose and therefore helps to create an emotional bond in your home."
"You won't fall in love with the power supply on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't stifle you."
It turns out that by good design and adding extra area, the standard apartment can wavy you.
In fact, you might choose to live like Joanne.

Two brothers play $500 million real estate empire battle
Four decades after the founding of its Italian family, the two brothers fought a battle for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, a former director and developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in a mansion located in the area of Tukara, where his brother Paul's residence lies. The latter has brought him to the Supreme Court with regard to the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to secede from family businesses since 2014, but the two brothers have heated debates over the asset split in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers owned a total of 38 properties worth more than $500 million, which were accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Corinwood District in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually developed into 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold for $85 million.
The money was then put into real estate. Currently, the De Rutis family's portfolio includes urban office buildings, Brunswick and Sorento development projects, Gold Coast and Blair Hill apartments, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, whom his brother Paul called the "major promoter and dominant figure" of the Der Ruthis family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounts for about a third.
In the documents submitted to the Tribunal, Corin's property valued at $316 million was converted and Paul's property valued at $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proves to be a conundrum.
"Colin's proposal for the division of property left him what I thought was best," he wrote in a 2015 first-time court affidavit.
Last Friday, after several mediation failures, the Supreme Court held a hearing for the first time.
Now the two brothers are still vying for control of existing businesses, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out.
Corin denies this and accuses Paul of mismanagement of certain real estate.
In his early affidavit, Corin said he wanted to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important," he wrote.
The cost of the case has been rising, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and company reports from Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, top-tier firms such as QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. De Rutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who started running Volkswagen restaurants and culinary stores in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used mortgages to buy Corinwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I read Gao 3," and he founded Westco there, "when Paul was still very young (about 10 years old).
Anna de Rutis said she and Louise, who died in 2012, wanted to pass the property peacefully on to her son.
"Louise often told me that he never wanted the brothers to be in court at last," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the De Rutis Group, Colin said that when Mark left the company he paid $10 million to him and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with their provisions for the division of property."
According to television star Eddie McGuire's bio from 2015, although Colin was a board member of the former AFL club, he remained low-key.
"Fairfax Media" contacted Colin and Paul on Friday, along with their lawyers.
But only Colin responded by SMS. He said that because the case had been submitted to the court, "I really can't say too much."
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family affairs to court, which was very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court filing that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I finally have such a dispute," he added, adding that he "still has hope for the settlement of disputes."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be dashed.
"Our problems will be resolved through the courts in the near future," Corin wrote.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media time
Others have tried, but they all failed.
John F. Kelly could really do it.
If so, he's the first person.
According to the U.S. political news website Politico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit information flowing to President Trump - including media reports - in order to ensure greater stability for the bosses.
The following is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When the new White House chief of staff John F. Kelly began his first day work with senior officials to gather for discussion, he pointed out that he was going to address a major issue in President Trump's entry into the White House: bad news flowing into the president's hands."
Kelly told these officials that getting good information helped the president make better decisions, so it would take his hand - either in writing or in brief.
Kelly's diagnosis is similar, but others have tried to tame it by monitoring Trump's media time, but all ended in failure.
President Trump's televised addiction has been around for a long time - now in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico: "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be great to let him know that he has also received positive coverage in credible channels."
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time, "Based on the experience of six former campaign officials, controlling Trump's habit of Twitter is focused on ensuring that some praise has been given to media information he personally receives."
It's completely unproblematic.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was once "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that if they didn't intervene, Trump's Twitter would be even more turbulent.
We may never know the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his staff can save him from the fire, even if only a few times, their efforts are worthwhile.
But no one has been able to keep Trump from controversial.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people are promoting their worldview by submitting potentially reliable or unreliable information to Trump and leveraging their careers.
Politico - all about this story - reported in May on the solicitors' appetite for strategically providing suspicious information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Schein Goodmanche:
"Trump's current and former officials have said that Trump's response to negative news clips such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with disruptive information leaks, will be wildly wanted to find its source."
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on GotNews.com, a web instigator Charles C. Johnson's website to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of "the source of massive information leaks" for the White House when Trump was acting like that.
Even though Johnson has been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, he did not provide any specific evidence and he blasted a lot of faulty quality control that was later openly denied.
Trump looked at the article and then began asking officials what happened to Walsh."
Gudermanche also said that then Chief of Staff Reins Pribas and White House Secretary Robert Potter "have tried to build a system to manage and record the documents Trump has received."
What about the outcome?
Kelly intends to do the same thing after three months.
Perhaps he could prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the rushed Trump, and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly's task difficult.
Tourists in the town: How to get drunk
[Summary] The potential of the Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened.
Today, these small towns have become an important destination for visitors to Zhejiang to appreciate the mountains and waters of Zhejiang, read the culture of Zhejiang, and feel the sadness of Zhejiang Township, which will also provide significant assistance in my efforts to create "Zhejiang Poetry Painting" China's most beautiful tourist destination.
Wins in the mood
"The scent of the moon is rising, and the fragrance of the barbecue comes from the wind.
"Walking around Shaoxing Anchanggu Town, there are traditional handicrafts such as hugs, bamboo making, ironing, shoes, picking a lace, spinning cotton and other craftsmanship that fully demonstrate the intangible cultural heritage of Anchanggu Town.
It is reported that during the three-day holiday of New Year's Day this year, more than 65,000 tourists from Anchanggu Town.
In Zhejiang, such a unique small town as the city of Anchanggu: Jiaxingxi Tong's frantic waves flow through the warm and euphemistic environment of Jiangnan Waterland; 28th Qzhou white wall Deva, speaking about the years of thousands of ancient cities crumbling; fishermen in Taizhou Shitang Town painting, drawing out both traditional and modern fishing life... These towns are "the palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism, but also the "heart love" of eight tourists.
In recent years, with the advancement of all-round tourism construction in my province, the potential of Zhejiang small town has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the provincial government's office officially published "The implementation of the methods for creating a tourism and leisure town in Zhejiang Province", which proposed through about five years, to identify around 100 popular folklore and folk style, an ecologically beautiful environment, and a wealth of tourist attractions in the province.
Today, these small towns have become an important destination for visitors to Zhejiang to appreciate the mountains and waters of Zhejiang, read the culture of Zhejiang, and feel the sadness of Zhejiang Township, which will also provide significant assistance in my efforts to create "Zhejiang Poetry Painting" China's most beautiful tourist destination.
The relevant head of the provincial tourism bureau introduced that under the boom in the creation of tourist attractions and towns, now all over the province pay more attention to the creation of personalized tourism industry, new tourism projects and business status are unrivalled, bringing a rich experience to tourists, won a good reputation.
Remains in Propaganda
Recently, hosted by Zhejiang Province Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily News Industry Group, Zhejiang News Group's "small town x future artist" shared blending and "poetry painting in Zhejiang City?" 2017 Zhejiang Travel Fantasy Town Promotion Season Closing Ceremony was held at the Zhejiang Provincial Exhibition Hall.
"The scenic town has the beauty of art and a living temperature.
The mood of the small town lies in original juice, original taste, native country, a primitive ecological pureness.
China Academy of Fine Arts Film and Video Animation Art Film School teacher, domestic first-line film and television advertising director Xie Hanfeng, as well as the Dean of Chinese Metrology University College of Art and Communication Professor Xu Yi Hong, experts such as tell cross-border stories about small towns such as "Small Village Remodeling" in the lens.
Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources, and the representative of Dong from Nanxun city of Huzhou New Town has read the National Painting Nanxun at the scene for everyone.
Jiangnan Watertown has been loved by book painters since ancient times, and now Nanxungu Town is engaged in deep cooperation with other art institutions such as the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism in the small town is a must-have element of mood, tourism elements, service elements and environmental elements.
In this context, tourism services facilities and the environment are also very important elements.
Rainy day if you hand over a timely umbrella, it can also allow tourists to better experience the scenery of the small town.
In this shared era, Zhejiang News Group's hottest sharing umbrella company has customized a series of "Zhejiang" versions of the Shared Umbrella, hoping to promote the concept of "Shared? Green", enhance the civic tourism awareness and virtuous hearts of tourists and residents of small towns, creating a good tourist environment.
This has become a highlight of the 2017 Zhejiang tourism trendy town promotion season activity.
Looking forward to great
As of now, Zhejiang Province has released the first list of 21 provincial tourist attractions and created lists of 115 provincial tourist attractions.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the "13th Five-Year" period, scenic towns will eventually be built into 3A level and above tourist attractions, becoming a new model for diverse tourism products, outstanding tourism benefits, and win-win industrial integration.
The reason why the tourist attraction of a small town is attractive is its original flavour.
The beauty of the tourist attraction of small towns is not only derived from the flooding of a small bridge, but also from long-established cultural traditions; rural revitalization stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the world, the Dutch town of Lyser, Austria's Harstadt Town and French pumpkin towns are attracted by tulips, "salt" and pumpkins respectively, attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year.
For the temperate small town, the focus of "emphasizing characteristics and keeping people's sorrows" makes it clear that the city has a distinct personality and soul, and more in providing cultural immersion, carrying local ties, and highlighting the country and land civilization.
Tourism style small towns, with culture and sadness as a link, with humanities and landscapes as a vehicle, followed by four-way tourists, so that traditional styles and cultures are passed on and innovative in the co-building sharing.
In essence, the tourist town is a complex open-plan tourist area, and it should also be a shared living space for local residents and foreign tourists and even occupants.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, touristy towns can not only change the ecological appearance of rural areas, economic and social development mode, direction of flow of industrial elements, but also to bridge the urban-rural infrastructure gap and awaken a rural cultural recovery.
In the boom of accelerated revitalization in the countryside, Zhejiang tourist attractions and small towns will deduce more rich and wonderful stories.

Drivers negotiate the ditches and return to "Full Street"
Some of the wealthiest owners in West Midlands have again clashed with determined tenants, who consulted on a government-exploited ditches to demand restitution of land outside their mansions.
The occupants parked their 20 trailers on an empty ground outside the bustling Sollyhel Street, which was named "The Richman Street".
The occupants held horses, holding babies and leading the fleet of vehicles, returned again after being driven out in May, and the "Guardian River" dug up by the municipal department did not stop them from entering.
The smooth and resilient team found a gap in the line of defense, although there was no roadblock for passage, their vehicles were squeezed through that gap.
Angry residents vehemently criticized the Solihull Council, calling it "bad in dealing with this issue."
An unnamed resident said: "They arrived there on Monday night before they came to Benefit Street and threw stones at past passers-by.
The Commission should be ashamed of their actions, for they have nothing to do with the matter.
The occupants arrived here in May and were then driven away, now they're back.
"There were a lot of last night, and there might be more today."
She added: "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with the way it protects its parks by enforcing long-term bans.
I live on Streetbrook Road, and if the parliament can't stop such things, I wouldn't want to continue paying municipal taxes.
A local resident who did not want to be named said: "It's ridiculous that we just saw the last batch of chauffeurs go away, but it was easy for another batch to destroy."
This number has increased again, and some have even seen horses eating grass on the park lawn."
A spokeswoman for the Solihel Commission said: "We know that there are unauthorized camping on an empty space in Szjutzbrook Road, and now we work with the Solihel police and take the necessary legal action to get them moving as soon as possible."
To support our collection of evidence, it is important to ask as many local residents as possible to report any antisocial or criminal act to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to draw up a picture of the situation when we submit cases to the Court for review."

Italy takes a hard-line approach to the NGO's Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy has warned non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their rescue if no new operational regulations are signed.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin Daily News: "If non-governmental organizations do not sign new codes of conduct, it is difficult to see what they are going to follow."
On the day before Minnitty's warning, Italian officials seized it on suspicion that a crew of German aid organization "Young Rescue" on board actually colluded with traffickers and helped illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and declined to comment on the specific topic of accusations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Caltocio.
In a social media statement, the organization said: "Saving lives is now and will be the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in search-and-rescue areas right now."
"Once we have collected all the information, we can only assess all allegations and situations."
Italy's official vessel, Iuventa, has been monitoring the youth salvage organization since October.
Its crew was suspected of carrying migrants who were transported directly by small boats with human traffickers and allowed smugglers to flee hurriedly and reuse the ship.
According to the prosecutor's documents, at least one such meeting was allegedly held 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast and the contents of the document were published by Italian media.
Its crew is suspected of blatantly disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian enthusiasm rather than any other motivation.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly need an Italian policeman on board to monitor their activities.
Currently, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with codes of conduct: Save the Children's Club, Marjom-based Immigration Maritime Assistance Station and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new regulations unnecessarily acceptable, as they would not bring any "significant changes and impediments" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said a sharp drop in immigration to Italy in recent weeks indicates that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guard and unite local mayors have been first-hand effective.
"In recent days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel."
He unveiled plans for this month's in-depth talks: to discuss economic development activities with Libyan mayors and Chad, Niger and Mali on how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries to Europe.
Transportation Bank chief financial scientist Jian Ping said that due to the end-of-season characteristics of industrial value additions in the first three quarters of 2017, it is expected that industrial value added growth will accelerate to 6.6% in December.
The cumulative growth in fixed assets investment is expected to be 7.2% in December, which is the same as last month, down from last year.
Industrial production, although weaker than October, is basically the same as November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was running at a low level, but infrastructure investment has improved slightly, so it is expected that fixed assets investment will be flat in November.
More than 200,000 people entered the United States, mostly as smugglers; being in foreign countries, returning home indefinitely, relatives are separated, similar scenes continue to take place.
Beijing's new "high school evacuation" initiative: 10,000 teachers and students of North Chemical will be in Changping New Campus
The opening ceremony of Beijing Chemical University's new campus was held in Changping District, Beijing City, and the 1800-acre green campus was officially put into operation.
Reporters learned from the ceremony that in order to strengthen the core function of the capital and manage "big city disease", in recent years, in the context of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei's coordinated development and evasion of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the promotion of high schools in the central city area to the suburban estrangement, some high school teachers and students have successively transferred to Shunyi, Daxing, Home Mountain and other suburban new campuses.
The North Chemical New Campus is located in Changpingnankou town, covers an area of 1800 acres, 40 km from the city center, and is one of Beijing's key projects to dispel non-capital functions.
The new school is divided into three stages of construction, the current phase 1 construction has been completed, Phase 2 construction is expected to be fully launched at the end of this year, and after all completion plans will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, graduate and faculty members to study and live.
When we look back at this year's film market, we find that the original text of the film and the two fans of starring stars are an important part of the movie's expected audience.
Today, at 17.10 a.m., Shoyang City's 119 command center received an alarm and four hydrogen furans stored in the city's ambitious chemical plant Longhuattang in Dingqing district were burned.
Shoyang City Fire Brigade immediately dispatched 5 squadrons of 20 fire vehicles carrying heavy protective clothing, anti-septic cleaning and other equipment to the scene.
After preliminary detection, the fire was a small storage tank of chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans, which produced large amounts of smoke.
As of the reporter's draft, fire officers and soldiers are in intensive rescue, urban health, safety supervision, environmental protection, security, transportation and other departments have successively rushed to the scene, no casualties were found.
Michelle Carter sentenced Conrad Roy to commit suicide by texting
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for inciting a boyfriend to commit suicide by texting and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve a sentence of 15 months and can be converted to probation after expiration.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional premeditated murder against Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at a hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken."
My son is my best friend."
While waiting for the appeal, Carter was allowed to keep his personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
When the verdict was issued, Carter stood up, wearing red trousers and rice hoodies, holding hands tightly, tears in both eyes, looking down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life in order to live better.
"She's not responsible," the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible consequence and she felt very sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he hadn't found her "age or maturity and even her mental illness would have any significant impact on her behavior."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said: "I have no day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of all that I and I have done. I am trying to stand with his sisters in all my sufferings, which will accompany us forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "spiritually trance" because of the realization that she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"Losing someone who has accompanied me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will be fraught with it," she said.
This case seems to have created a precedent for law, as Massachusetts's laws do not prescribe the guiltyness of inciting others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the car; that year Carter was 17 years old.
Carter's text message revealed that she had incited him to commit suicide, and the case sparked national attention.
"There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself," she said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the time before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do this, Conrad," and "all you have to do is start a generator and then get free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter garnered attention through Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of legal opinion in this case.
Amanda Knox is one of those who has been accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, two years after being acquitted.
30-year-old Ms. Nox said in an article published in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment."
Zhang is destined to be a controversial film artist, since he began shooting the first movie "Red sorghum", he has been leading the Chinese cinema trend while also harvested many undisputed.

Automakers face shock and Audi will retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before Audi announced the refit, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW's chairman said BMW believes that "driving has more intelligent options than restrictions," meaning major European cities - including the company's headquarters in Munich - are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would retrofit 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company claimed the move was a recall.
European automakers have vigorously promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel car exhaust emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, Prime Minister Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of overlegating these powerful car companies and neglecting signs of the issue.
These auto companies are trying to avoid recurrence with Volkswagen, by masking their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions when the vehicle is tested to comply with regulations and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been accused in the United States, while others are being investigated across the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zachero Giovani Pamyo is an Italian and therefore unprotected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving the masses, and the German government accused Audi of installing systems to evade European emissions requirements, expanding its scope previously limited to U.S. investigations.
Audi's investigation could have a significant impact on Volkswagen: Deluxe automakers take over the disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
A film from preparation to release, which lasts one or two years or even a few years, can be regarded as commonplace.
The animated film "Big Fish and Seabird" has announced that it will be released on July 8, which lasted from preparation to release for 12 years!
The original author of "Big Fish Haitang", 21-year-old from Tsinghua University thermal energy power professional apprenticeship, and his friend Zhang Chun together founded the Beisho Tian, in 2008 received a $1 million venture capital investment by co-founders, launched an animated film debut "Big Fish Hai Tang".
The film has won numerous awards at home and abroad during the creative stage, and is also engraved and acclaimed as "one of the most outstanding works of art" by the French Centre for Contemporary Art Pompidou.
Due to the six-year period from creativity to production, the film is called "the pit" by millions of fans who look forward to its release.
The trailer tells a fantastic story that belongs to Chinese people. With the release of this scheduled trailer, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
"These 12 years have only done this thing, and now it has become a reality from a dream that I am both nervous and excited."
Zhang Chun said: "Old thinking about using another 50% of the budget, make exactly the same picture effect as others, the team will be driven by me."
Dongguan, the "world factory" that once relied on feed processing and a large number of general works, is focusing on those high-level talents who can lead the city to relocate.

Proven Lavender is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is deteriorating due to persistent drought and the presence of virus-carrying insects, which has left scientists and farmers trying to find solutions with headaches.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agricultural Research (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: "Proven's lavender is facing a huge threat as it has been affected by climate change in recent years, with significant reductions in spring rain and splint rainfall in autumn.
This will affect the lifecycle of lavender.
There is also an individual smaller cicadas, a leafy cicadas that can spread small bacteria, which will appear in very dry weather."
The key is its huge number.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, elegant lavender fields are also sought after by the perfumery and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase said: "Contrary to the plantation that can produce many large flowers with very long ears, there are small, stunted, missing or weak individuals.
So our essential oils are smaller."
Solutions being studied include better irrigation techniques and slowing vaporization of soil moisture, protective mixtures of clay and water spraying on plants, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the sci-fi elements in the film, the two lead actors have said that more attractive to them is the story in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, a newspaper reporter from Huaxi Metropolis interviewed several celebrities and two vocal performers in succession, astonished that they were almost unanimous.
One is a Berlin shadow emperor, one is an ascendant young actor, and "Psychic Sin" is also the first partner of Liaofan and Li Yifeng.
Mexico is at risk and journalists are killed
All employees of the Riodotes weekly newspaper will usually rally on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting riots in Sinalo State, caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and an enduring drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over them and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they are told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what was more safe: whether to take their children to the office (which had been hit by hand grenades in 2009) or stay them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemies, neutrals and allies.
They let the journalists name them in each column - no evidence, observation and intuition is enough.
Suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government's list, or cartels, have put Mexico's reporting work at risk.
The violence has never ceased, and there are more and more journalists across the country: according to the record of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists were protected by the federal government after they were attacked and threatened; and so far this year at least seven journalists have died within seven states.
The last one to die was their editorial and inspirational source, as well as the co-founder of Riodoce's Harvey Waldiz Cadenas.
Valdez wrote many books about drug violence, one of which he wrote: "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist."
Everyone can feel deeply that he has left, although he is everywhere - a huge photo hanging on the front of Riodoce's office building, which Valdez puts in the t-shirt with the words "justice"; and Aaron Ivara and Miriam Ramieres, two 30-year-old journalists, also wear T-shirts showing his smiles, wearing glasses or his iconic Panamanian straw cap.
Less than two months after his death, the seminar was held; journalists discussed their common tragedies, nightmares, insomnia and hypocrisy.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with journalistic cases, according to the record of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it only prosecuted two people.
The majority of thousands of criminal cases each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of journalistic killings are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting violence in the state of Sinaloa, although they had already heartbroken, even though the land was sore.
Ivara said that without the information of the culprits and justice, it would not be useful to hold a security seminar.
He said, "It's stupid to waste time attending such a seminar."
"As long as we don't know why, you don't believe anyone."
On the morning of 15 May, Waldiz left the Riodoce office in the capital Kuliakan.
His red Toyota Carola was stopped by two men in just a few blocks; they drove him off the car and fired 12 guns, guessing because of the newspaper's name - translated into The Twelve Ways.
The gangsters drove off his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
He left his wife and two grown-up children.
Curiacan rumored four times.
But the subject of Valdez, in fact, has nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaro has become the country's bloodiest battleground, with rival forces battling.
One or several people were shot every day on the streets of Sinaro, and the graveyard was filled with two gorgeous mausoleums of drug lords, which are commonplace.
For a while, forgetting the "smooth" state is only when one cartel controls this coastal state and its ports and drug routes to the United States.
Even so, even if Waldiz knew deeply about the dangers of this job, Ismael Pohoqui, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, was still guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believed that two mistakes caused the tragedy.
First, in February, Damaso Lopez's interview was published, leading a cartels group that fought several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; as soon as it was sent to the newsstand, the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members.
The second mistake was that another newspaper reporting the same story had not been forced to leave Mexico for his own security considerations after being confiscated.
Valdez is a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit endures, and his friends and colleagues believe he has always been with us.
In 2003, he was a senior Noroeste reporter who co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues and sold $50.
In the state of Sinaro, Pohokui said, "It's impossible to get into the news industry without dealing with the drug problem."
With the passage of time, the newspaper won a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, with sales and advertising also increasing.
Journalists like to be able to publish investigative reports that directly strike the culprits without worrying about censorship, and readers also like newspapers to publish stories other people dare not report.
Riodoce was awarded the Latin American Mariamoscapo News Award five years after its founding.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdez International Freedom of Information Award in recognition of his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug reports.
He confessed that he was afraid too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded awards, he said: "I want to continue living."
Later in late October, he said in an interview with local television station Rompeviento TV that "drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaro."
You have to bear the task of falling on your shoulders as a journalist - either so or deaf.
I don't want to be asked, 'In the face of so many deaths, what have you done...why haven't you heard about what is happening?'
All of Riodoce's employees missed Valdez, he was cursed like a pier worker, the friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, the teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar, which often goes to the opposite of the office, is also always sitting on the same table.
Now, they're going to ask: Did his daily habits cause him to fall?
His death also made them have to think about how to work and live well.
"They don't like you making trouble with their women and children, nor do they like your influence on their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs."
All of this has transcended their bottom line."
The result is that, even at the most secure time, you should maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection.
Believe in your intuition.
If you smell dangerous breath, hurry away.
Riodoce editor Andres Vilarill said the problem was "breathing is a feeling of being deceived...and then something like Harvey would happen."
He and others have said that previous rules no longer apply to the state of Cinaro - just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where smuggling routes are lucrative while agencies are weak, government officials are corrupted and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees took part in security training, mobile phones were suddenly not allowed; a few days ago espionage software allegedly sold only to the government had been used for surveillance of journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, the two police officers snorkel under the shade and avoid high temperatures of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighborhood of Curiacan.
Some reporters were half-jokingly teasing about not knowing if the police would be 50 percent of what the governor himself said.
Reporters have been in the mountains for months, where drug-trafficking groups are under actual control.
This week's "Riodoce" featured three major events.
Among them were the killings of the brothers of the great former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaro,
There are also government funding disclosures from the governor's hometown,
As well as kidnappings inside an expensive restaurant in Kuliacan, the restaurant is only a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officials do not publish information about the subjects and the process of kidnapping, so it is necessary to write down what the city knows: that this restaurant is a place where drug dealers and officials love.
A journalist learned from public records that the restaurant was registered as a politician in the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which dominated political classes almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several governors of the Revolutionary Institutional Party were accused of embezzlement in a number of high-profile cases.
Villarill asked reporters to write about what had happened before the incident, including a son of Mexico's No. 1 drug lord Guzman hiding from military attacks.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdez's column to find the most powerful information about the kidnapping.
46-year-old Vilariel, who is called "lean son" because of his thinness, said: "We've known what has happened before.
All of our sources of information are now intercepted.
Valdez's office is now used to store signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, as employees have become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramieres took a logo out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office for a march related to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the death of Valdez in Michoaken State in the west.
The official found a scorched body and said that according to DNA tests, this was his body.
All over the country, journalists have become more intrusive, organizing protests and placarding "saving media" on pavements and buildings.
On this day, director Bohokui is not in Washington and he is working to bring justice for the Wardiz case and seek international support.
The next day, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaro, Valdiz was killed, Lamirez complained about official stabbed journalists and killed them because they said the facts.
Given that her anger has already affected her objectivity, she also asked for a resignation from the post to cover government affairs.
Valdez has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are "encircled" by organized crime, colliding government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that journalists were not only maimed by drug-trafficking groups, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who collide with organized crime.
Media monitoring group Articulo 19 blamed more than half of the journalists' attacks last year on police and public officials.
Lamirez said: "In Mexico, they let you die in order to keep you silent."
Clearly, these murders are chilly.
No one forgets that six years ago, Bohemian Maria Elizabeth Massias died on the northern border of Tamoulipas.
Next to her body is a letter allegedly signed by Zetaskatel: "I came for my report."
Her skull was cut off, next to a computer keyboard and headset.
After Miloslawa Bretch was killed in March, some newspapers opted to shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still going on, and the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they're still continuing.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page public conversation with drug cartels titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their hometown or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
Hard to find work in exile, and they still have to be cautious on the streets and alerted to danger.
Sometimes they'll be arrested and are said to have been killed in a Mexican city with four women three months after fleeing Veracruz in 2015.
For those who are still working behind the scenes, this is a day-to-day step in high-risk decision making.
Ivara once wanted to be a poet, admitting that reporting on the drug trade made him frightened.
"Mexico is turning into hell, so I'm a journalist."
Last Friday afternoon, the latest issue of newspapers had been printed, and Riodoce's editors sat on a walk outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phones rang.
A series of gunfights and security forces near the beach resort town of Mastland have been confirmed to have killed 19 people.
The war is also escalating, as a series of cartel information discovered in the region foreshadows.
They uploaded news to Riodoce's website on the roadside.
The next day's headlines had to be changed.
The flute rang nearby - there was another shooting in the area of a dead and alive duel.
Pohoku glanced at the police guard standing there to see if they were alert.
If they have a little bit of fear, then they don't show up either.
The founder of the newspaper has died, and on his large portraits, his middle finger points to where the entire state of Sinaro needs to be looked at, with all Riodoce's staff following his footsteps.
The same day that Harvey was killed, the interns asked me to send her to the street for coverage."
China self-driving car tourism in 2020 market size or breakthrough trillion yuan
[Summary] In the context of consumer escalation and widespread freedom, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, self-driving markets that are expected to break through trillion scales also face double challenges.
In the context of consumer escalation and widespread freedom, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and a growing number of consumers.
But at the same time, self-driving markets that are expected to break through trillion scales also face a double challenge, on the one hand, the development of self-driving industry and market demand are not in line with each other, self-driving clubs and travel agencies such as self-driving organizations face a slim profit dilemma; on the other hand, the infrastructure and services faced by self-driving companies are still in their early stages.
60% of the total number of domestic tourists, market size is expected to break trillions
In 2016, the total annual domestic tourism of 4.44 billion people, self-driving tours accounted for about 60% of the total number of domestic tourism, by 2020, the scale of the self-driving market is expected to exceed trillions.
According to the statistics of the number of self-driving cars by the Chinese Association of Travel Car and Ships, the number of people travelling from China has continued to grow in recent five years, with the proportion of travelers accounted for more than half of domestic tourism.
At the same time, regional and national levels showed more attention and support to the emerging field of self-driving, with policies and regulations related to self-driving cars, lodging vehicles and camping tourism intensively promulgated from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments such as the National Tourism Bureau and the State Sports Administration jointly issued the Development Plan for Auto Self-Driving Camps; in the same month, the Action Programme for Promoting the Advancement and Improvement of Rural Tourism Development (2017) was jointly issued by the Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Self-driving clubs are very profitable, and the complete industrial chain is key
Although the domestic self-driving market has great potential and national policies are actively guiding, the self-driving industry is still in its initial stage.
According to the China Self-Driving Annual Development Report 2016-2017, there are thousands of domestic self-driving clubs, automobile clubs, car club and so on, but the proportion of tourists self-organized self-driving tour accounted for the majority, and only about 15% of visitors participated in various institutions such as car club and self-driving club.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving products are also a few, many online travel platforms sell only some suppliers offered self-driving products, and some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From the organization of self-driving tours, it covers "eating, living, walking, traveling, buying, entertainment" in many aspects, with a high degree of fragmentation, heavy supply chain upstream, and tourist consumption is random.
Li Hongzhi, founder and CEO of Beijing's Baitan Auto Club, believes that self-driving car clubs are similar in nature and travel agencies, the early main profit model is based on offline activities, the core point is self-driving line products and leadership services.
But now the self-driving tour in the field of internal line product homogenization is serious, the leadership service level is not uniform, and the self-driving club faces a need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving tour in itself is not an independent industry, but its displacement characteristics form a cross-regional and industrial ecology, forming a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts pointed out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumer element.
Therefore, for the development of self-driving tour industry, you should enhance the experience characteristics, develop the "self-driving tour +" theme and the IP of self-driving products.
The scenic path is not just a road, the car camp should not only cater for accommodation.
Faced with the rise of self-driving rides, the basic development of self-driving rides is also relatively primary.
Li pointed out that the tourist scenic road is not only a road, but needs to integrate transport and tourism elements in it, but highway repair and tourism itself are two departments responsible, transportation department increase travel elements, but also stay in construction of toilets, consulting centers, propaganda columns and other facilities, with the degree of integration with tourism is not high.
Compared to the well-known self-driving route "American Route 66", construction experience is worth drawing on.
The design of the scenic path is no longer the most direct and quickest route between departure and destination, but follows the concept of "experience driving fun", which provides self-driving tourists with the best experience to appreciate the views along the road; the scenic path can link pictorial and facial tourism landscapes, both preserving the historical value and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, as well as organizing various thematic events to enhance the participation and leisure experience of tourists, creating economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the scenic path, the camp is also an important supporting facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists New York Times reporters, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are biased towards infrastructure, can only meet the needs of eating, low grades, a single product, unable to meet the need for self-driving tour which contains many elements.
There are industry insiders who do not want to be named said that in the previous few years, many of the enterprises were made for land, after land, late support infrastructure construction and services did not keep up with, business situation is a lot of losses, and no later funds injection, it is difficult to make some corresponding supporting products.
Category: Consumer Groups
According to data released in 2017 by the Chinese Association of Travel Car and Ships, from an age perspective, self-driving groups are concentrated at 21-40 years old, including mainly 31-40 years old, this part of the population has a certain economic basis, and the demand for personalized tourism is higher, and more for relatives and children.
From the housing survey, self-driving tourists are relatively more inclined to non-standard accommodation.
From the point of view of self-driving tour type, peripheral self-driving is the main type of self-driving tour, accounting for 84.32%.
Departure self-driving is a longing for many people, but the proportion is still smaller.
At the same time, with the improvement of consumer demand, tourists who used to like self-driving "visiting attractions" began to change the concept, no longer in the process of self-driving "down car photos, go to bed", but more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs Use Masks to Avoid Enemies
At first glance, it was terrifying but looked like a statue.
The researchers published their first research on rhino-sized, incredible biofossils found by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved and therefore experts call it "Mona Lisa in the dinosaur realm."
This fossil is preserved very well, and can even determine the color of its squamous skin as red brown. This indicates that it has had some "annoying experiences."
Reports in the journal Contemporary Biology describe it as "one of the best preserved champagne dinosaurs ever found and one of the world's finest specimens."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of broccoli that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous.
Its preservation status was extremely well-preserved, shocking the researchers, who described it as "really stunning."
According to the National Geographic Journal, this type of herbated champagne dinosaur fossil is the best-preserved fossil of similar dinosaurs ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered the fossil at a mining site in Senkol Millennial near Fort McMurry in northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he encountered something that seemed not as large as the surrounding rock, so he decided to look at it carefully.
Afterward, the fossils he found were sent to the Royal Museum of Paleontology in Terrell.
The researchers took six years to show the beast inside a block of 2,500 pounds (1,100 kilograms) of soil.
After such strenuous work, the final results are now made public.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a Royal Tyrell Museum scientist and first author.
"It will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens in scientific history - Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that this herbivorous creature, although dressed in armour like a walking tank, could be subject to significant threats from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The dinosaurs wearing heavy armor use red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators and adopt stealth techniques known as "anti-shadowing," a technique used by many modern animals.
In this way, experts say it is better able to integrate with its surroundings and thus avoid the enemy, suggesting that it has been preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the Cherry Dragon family, became headlines for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Museum of Paleobiology.
After Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was one of the team's members, spent 7,000 hours carefully unveiling the beast's veil, the researchers now studied it and named it "Borealopelta Markmitchelli".
The samples were preserved so well that Dr. Mitchell, along with the international team of scientists, could record their scales and armor patterns and shapes.
They discovered "anti-shadowing" techniques, a common defensive approach in the animal world, meaning that the species's back is darker than its side color.
Although the "anti-shadowing" technique is common, the results of the discovery are surprising because the dinosaur's size far outweighs the existing animal using anti-shadowing techniques.
This dinosaur is under pressure to be hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs and thus evolves in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide within the barrier as a means of survival.
However, most existing anti-tanning animals such as deer, zebra or armadillo are as small and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the creature is facing real survival pressures.
"The frenzied prey on large heavy-handed dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Cretaceous Meat Dinosaurs are," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic complex in its scales also indicates that the dinosaur's skin color is red and brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life cues of the creature, including its retained stomach contents, in order to find the final food.
They believed that dinosaurs fell into rivers at the time of death, then rushed into the sea and finally sinked to the bottom in a way back down.
At the time, Alberta's climate was as warm as today's in southern Florida, and rivers and seas could be deeper intoland than they are now.
Brown said: "This choke dragon is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the preserved squamous skin, and has so far been kept in dimensional space to preserve its original shape."
"Therefore, this species is now almost the same shape as it was in the Cretaceous period.
You don't need to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you will almost believe it is sleeping."
The Cretaceous period is a time when bipedal large stony dinosaurs roam on Earth.
Although the dragon is a king of dinosaurs, it only appeared for millions of years after the champagne dinosaurs. The champagne dinosaurs may have been hunted by some of the ancestors of the champagne.
They include a 6-ton, 38-foot (11.5 meters) long beast.
The latest study found scientists in the journal Contemporary Biology believe that chopped dragons were rushed into the sea after death, and then formed mummies in the dirt.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Finke excavated the creature at a millenium mine near Fort McMurry in Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved champagne dinosaur in the world, with complete skin and armor from the nose to the hips.
The average creature is about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch long, pointed corners from the shoulder.
The researchers believe the herbivorous champagne dinosaurs are now active in western Canada, after which rivers rushed into the sea by an outbreak of flooding.
However, the dinosaurs buried under the sea made their nails fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are preserved very well, so that the remaining skin is still covered with sloppy blades on dinosaur skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine, this level of preservation is as rare as a mid-color.
The more I look, the more I find it unbelievable.
Remaining skin fossils are still covered with armor patched on dinosaur skulls.
Its right front palm is located on its side, with five toes unfolding upwards.
"I can count my squirrels."
The reporter learned that the addition of natural or plant sources of hydroalgaic acid, corrosive acid and amino acid additive carriers into the urea production process can be modified to improve the effectiveness of traditional urea, formed sea algal urea, zinc peroxide urea, haglutin nitine utilization rate is increased by 5-10 percentage points compared with ordinary urea.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for crop production is obvious, especially large particles of value-added urea are also a quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel is twice as high as the 2012 London Olympics.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch the largest security linkage plan ever.
The Brazilian government said a total of 85,000 men from the army and police will fight together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police.
The majority of the military will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for security at international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrol the rest of the city, including subways, public transport and streets.
It is reported that at present 6,000 military personnel have arrived in the vicinity of Olympic security services.
In addition to the four-game areas of the Rio Olympics, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport as well as main roads connecting airports and Olympic venues.
The introduction of an evaluation mechanism in the service industry has long been no new thing, to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and non-formal.
How Radicals Learned To Answer The Question: "Whose Street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was frightened.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the Saint Louis man sat in Epic rented a bed and browsed Facebook on his phone.
She stumbled upon a post by a high school student.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old and the child is still lying on the street."
She found that no one else was posting this information on the feed, and she was puzzled by shutting down Facebook and opening Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user keeps pushing her dynamic timelines.
The death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street that had lost his vital signs, and his corpse lay in the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She dropped her phone and only opened Twitter again that night, reading tweets about the gathering of people on Canfield Avenue.
There were police footage and photos of people shouting, and a photo of someone who claimed to be Brown's father, which read: "The Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed that a policeman stood in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
She said in another video, another policeman raised his rifle screaming: "I'll kill all of you... beasts."
"It's not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"This is not a typical murder that we can call habitual."
At that moment, I felt chilly.
I'm angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Street?", released in theaters on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people who are living in this community, filled with streets and alleys asking for answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter drove to Ferguson (clothed in flower dresses, with crown accessories), the two rediscussed their countless conversations before that morning - "About Black Experience and Negro Status."
"Do you remember when I taught you that blacks have to fight for their faith?" she recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is not right."
I had to take her," Ferrell later said.
"What's happening today is the climax of everything in the past.
She wants to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in terms of radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of black experience and negro status and what we have to do to achieve freedom and emancipation.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with racist experiences she had not personally experienced, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this case, I think I'm hurting her."
They arrived at Ferguson's first station on a site opposite the South Florida San Road Police Station, where militants waited until police officer Darren Wilson finally failed to indict.
Ferrell and her daughter were contacted by a local business owner who was making sack lunch.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for handing them over to protestors.
Gradually, Ferrel began to form a new type of activism.
She said, "My radicalism has changed completely since 9 August."When she attended the undergraduate at Missouri State University St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Minority Nurses and Students with a focus on the food justice and health gaps in the black community.
"I have no organizational experience.
That's how it all came."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with the film co-director Sabah Forlayan during a night parade.
Forlayan said she and her photo director Lucas Alvarado Farler "just wanted to record" what had happened.
A question emerges in Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many such cases: People - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from its pain and toughness.
As Foleyan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that people who were native to Ferguson did not concentrate their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Forleyan has contacted co-director Demon Davis, a regional artist known for radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell and six other locals to join the "Who's Street?" project team, which has been unstoppable for years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us, it's our speech," Davis said.
"I'm mainly concerned about how these characters are presented, because that is also the way I am presented."
While the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experience - but to show that the movement "is not about savior leaders, but about community cohesion," Foleyyan said.
As a result, "Who's the street?" surprisedly recorded Ferrell's personal life such as falling in love and getting married.
"I feel like I'm naked," Ferrell laughed as he first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that doing this and humanizing black people must have a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cuddly women in the broader Black Life Event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 Black Teen Travon Martin shooting - were identified as cool.
"Black cuddly women in the leadership generally supported this movement," Ferrell said, "it's because we keep fighting on multiple fronts."
Black squirrels have to bear it all."
Forlayyan agreed and mentioned that "this movement is really supported by black women and many black cuddly women."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insists that "this is not a affirmative action for things."
"She's the one who inspires this energy," she said.
"While she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence. Because in these crossroads of life, as a black cuddly woman, you have a lot to do."
Through the screen, you can feel her energy."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but tensions between the community and police persist.
Ferrell was sentenced to more than two-and-a-half years &apos; probation for trying to block the highway during a parade.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in what she calls her home area: "a mess."
Still, she has been sticking to the chants of her efforts to keep in mind since walking on Ferguson Street three years ago.
"We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have no more to lose, except for the shackles on our bodies."
In fact, online translation services were already available ten years ago on the Internet, and in fact a long time ago, the tweet about "machines are about to replace humans for translation" was no longer overheard.
Similarities: Artists Create Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
There are several faces in the center of the Friedman Gallery in New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, which are bound by lines that fall from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her cheek cotton swabs and hair scraps.
Manning sent hair scraps from Livingstock prison for leaking classified diplomatic telegrams through WikiLeaks, the ex-intelligence analyst who was sentenced to serve this sentence for 35 years.
The exhibition opened on August 2, titled "Resemblies".
This was the result of two years of communication between Duwie Hagburg and Manning, who combined his discipline with his own in technology, computer science and art, while Manning is a famous dissident who has been jailed and underwent transsexual surgery in prison. Former U.S. President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentences three days before the end of her term.
Using algorithmic analysis from Manning's DNA, he created 30 portraits of a "very likely appearance." Heatherdwey Habborg made a sharp and slightly relentless comment. His comments were both about the multi-intention nature of DNA as well as on the concept of identity itself.
Manning's name was Bradley Edward, who publicly acknowledged that he considered himself a woman during his adolescence. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges including six espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, only one photograph with particulate black and white self-portrait, which looked obvious uneasiness, sitting on the driver's seat wearing platinum wigs.
In 2015, Heatherdweigh Habborg achieved tremendous success in her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."
In that work, she used DNA extracted from scraps from cigarette butts and cucumbers to create portraits of a 3D person who might be similar in appearance.
That's when she just received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a portrait," Heatherdwey Habborg told the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or photograph, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA portrait.
So the artist and her imprisoned Muse became an improbable pen pal, exchanged many letters with each other in two years.
They even created a comic book Depressed Images, drawn by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book envisioned the president's future privilege for Manning and her ability to see an exhibition in prison.
Obama asked for her release just days after the book was published. This may be a coincidence, when Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another layer of deep concern. Because in contemporary America, the Trump administration is constantly declaring war on government leakers and transgender military personnel while looking for new ways to hype on Twitter to foment divisions nakedly, which are exactly what they want to bridge.
When asked about all this special time, Heatherdwey Habborg said: "Everything happens for a reason."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-sized signature is listed below (the name "i" was drawn with a heart) calling for an end to "gender, sexual orientation and culturally based partisanship."
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, writing Cs, Gs and As symbols with a pencil twisting twist.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, each artist's complex scientific dictionary), Heatherdwey Habborg wanted to express at least in physiological structures by depicting these strangely similar portraits.
"I hope people get rid of this dilemma, our genome doesn't care who we are, how open gene data is interpreted and how subjective it is," said Heatherdwey Harbog, whose 2007 video work False Memories was also on display.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last work in the exhibition, inside a room, comes from a page of novels in the front illustration.
Demonstrated Manning, brazen and stylized under an amplifier held by soldiers in the United States.
"When they stop your speech, they win," he wrote on the wall.
"So don't shut up."
"This content comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, I still want to say it."
Manning hasn't personally seen this exhibition, as the comics foresee, but when she does it, she will be masked by her own DNA portrait, just like a group of protesters get cheered at the pavilion center.
It's also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of her genetic single cluster information written in a pencil (5.2 feet, manning height).
"In the past I hung them on the wall, but I want them to feel like a bunch of people," said Duwey Hagburg, referring to portraits.
"But I want to make them feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting about releasing her."
Northwestern University professors and Oxford University employees are wanted for murder
Police said a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee were subsequently wanted and are currently looking for suspects across the country.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Wendem Lecem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued a first unannounced arrest warrant for the alleged death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durandro.
According to document records, 26-year-old Cornell Durandro died from multiple stab wounds.
The Chicago Police Department issued a community alert saying the body was discovered on July 27.
The police arrived at Grand Plaza apartment after a phone call and found several cracks on the victim.
Police said Cornell Durandro died on the scene, and detectives are investigating his killing while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lesem has been an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Ellen K. Cobage, deputy director of the Campus Relations Service, said in an email statement that Lesem was now separated and has been barred from accessing Northwestern University campuses.
"Now it's a criminal case, the authorities are investigating and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation."
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Summerville College at Oxford University said in an email statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as needed."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were both deeply shocked and hoped he could surrender.
Anthony Guillermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Service, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Guillermi said, "The police have already had a preconceived idea of their whereabouts and we are working hard to locate possible locations."
Guillermi said local, regional and national authorities are fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Guillermi said the police had received a call from Grand Plaza's apartment manager, who had just received a secret tip saying that there was something going on in Apartment 1008.
Police said the situation was terrifying.
Guillermi said it is still unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
According to the security camera, he confirmed that Lecem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe Professor Lecem has a certain relationship with the victims," Guillermi said.
Grand Plaza's management team issued a statement to residents, saying: "Police are currently investigating the victim's timeline and context of the case and are investigating various motives, including one possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said: "We will complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the implementation of the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will not take too long.
"The implementation of the roadmap standards has come to a certain stage, and RUSADA is given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK anti-doping agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Mutko made the above remarks in commenting on Part Two of the World Anti-Doping Agency's Roadmap Compliance, which set standards for restoring RUSADA rights and was recently posted on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not contain anything that could cause Russian concern.
He added, "Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented."
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that Russia's anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the WADA approval by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren about Russian state support for stimulant use in its sporting activities.
Speaking about the matter, Mutko said: "We are investigating that our anti-doping system has no doubt failed.
All measures have been implemented.
"But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit what does not exist."
Mutko's words echoed Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agency in the past during a visit to Russia's outlet RSport earlier that day, but added: "We have repeatedly said on various occasions that the report contains contentious positions and provisions.
No one plans to unconditionally accept this report," Smirnov said.
Following the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct a doping inspection in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director General Olivia Nagrid said in July that RUSADA was "in the right direction" working to restore its rights.

More than 8,000 products with zero tariffs
At a regular press conference held on January 11, the Ministry of Commerce said that as of now, there are 15 self-trade agreements in force and implemented by China, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8000 zero tariff import products.
At the same time, importing cosmetics, Icelandic trivial fish, Chilean red wine, and tropical fruits from ASEAN... you don't have to buy these products for a large price.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, there are 15 of them that have entered into force, covering more than 8000 zero tariff import products.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the free trade agreement, consumers can taste from different origins, high-quality and inexpensive agricultural products for four seasons.
For example, tropical fruits such as durians, lichi and hairo fruit in ASEAN have been reduced to zero import duties from 15% to 30%.
Iceland's trivial fish import duties have been reduced from 10% to 12% to zero.
Red wines in Georgia and Chile are reduced to zero from 14% to 30%.
There are also significant tax cuts for specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
For example, industrial goods, for example, some of the Swiss cosmetics import duties have been reduced to zero.
Some watch import duties have been reduced by 50 percent and will be lowered to zero after a few years.
South Korea's import tariffs on refrigerators, cookpots, massagers, beauty salons and other products have been reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero in a few years.
There are also significant tax cuts such as consumer e-products.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the free trade zone also include many intermediates and raw materials needed for domestic end consumer goods manufacturing, and to a certain extent promoted the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
The Ministry of Commerce spokesman said that nearly a third of the total imports of products in China can enjoy the treatment of preferential tariffs under the Free Trade Agreement, most of which are end-user goods, bringing real benefits to consumers.
Further Reducing Consumer Goods Import Tariffs
Since December 1, 2017, China has adjusted some consumer goods import tariffs to further reduce consumer goods import duties, covering food, health care products, medicines, daily supplies, clothing and footwear hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily department stores and other categories of consumer goods, involving a total of 187 8-digit tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this batch of consumer goods will be directly reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost being cut off!
Since January 1, 2018, China has also partially adjusted other import and export tariffs.
The import duties on some cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shadows and perfumes have been reduced from 10% to 5%.
After the lowering of tariffs, it means that consumers do not need to buy substitutes, and no longer have to go abroad to buy favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Imported Goods Shopping Festival: Importing Red Wine, Snacks, Fruit... All Cheap!
Outline: At the end of the year, the U.S. shopping mall regulations vary greatly and store returns need to be cautious
29.01.2018 New York City
According to the U.S. World Daily, just after Christmas, there was a tide of return.
According to the ABC, about half of goods sold last Christmas were resold.
In addition, there are many times the readers of blasting online shopping were deceived, and consumers need to pay more attention when shopping on informal websites.
Generally, large shopping companies have regular and reasonable returns procedures, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce from some small stores, be careful.
On December 1, Ms. Rolandon's Hou local time bought a coat in an online store specializing in printing jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same), and it hasn't been sent yet.
She sent emails to the customer service and did not receive a reply.
Another netizens exploded last year to the United States, buying a mobile phone from third-party sellers, sent and found that there was a box of rubber mud inside.
After knowing that you are cheated, apply for a refund to the website, and it is also good to get full refund.
But customers also believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
A Chinese-American resident of North California, Mr. Wang said that he had purchased an urgent delivery service for a website twice, one emergency service four yuan, but not two times on time.
No refunds have been filed and no response has been received.
Large shopping or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most of Macy's goods are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must be kept as "previous" and require purchase credentials such as receipts or bank purchases.
If there is no voucher, the customer can also get a shopping mall score that can be used to buy other goods.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods, and e-products are typically 15 days.
But the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased from November 1 to December 25, 2017 was extended to 30 days.
Note that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, which is to be returned by January 25, 2018.
Amazing shopping experience, a new era of shopping development in the business circle.
More than a decade ago, China was generally still in the seller market, people's choice is limited, and demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has already achieved a transformation from the seller's market to the buyer's market, today's consumer taste is becoming more disconcerting, they are no longer satisfied with the simple "one hand money one hand delivery" shopping behavior.
So, how to get consumers an extremely shopping experience is the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that affect the consumer shopping experience, the impact of shopping malls in the shopping circle is most significant.
Look at how city builders focus on the shopping experience.
There are no two pieces of exactly the same leaves in the world, more than two completely identical shopping centers, a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, Turkey's world-famous Kanyon shopping center, its unique waveform architectural design is inspired by the Canyon, so Kanyon, called Harmony, walks 200 meters along the steps of Lieutenant Colonel Kanyon as if to be inside the canyon.
In addition to the canyon design, there is also a large oval performance venue in the center of the shopping centre with unique shapes and frequent feature performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each layer to view the activities carried out in the "canyon", and have the effect of moving forward.
In China, Nanjing Forest Moore Commercial Street, which is known as the first Chinese forest-style strolling consumer site, combines shopping with ecological and fairy tales perfectly.
7,000 square meters of green land square, 3,000 square meters rooftop water platform, the project consists of nine single-body buildings, each building is connected by air corridors, the overall sinking courtyard design, based on the French turquoise tree for construction furnishings, rooftop water platforms, to create a foresty feeling.
Walking into the forest mole, like accidentally falling into Alice's roaming rabbit hole, climbed along the trunk to surround the building, grasslands and clear springs lined up, bringing people into a vibrant and vibrant forest.
There is also in Chongqing, Dragon Lake created the Riiga beachfront water merchant circle, planning Baifeng business, plans to introduce more than 50 international top specialty flagship stores, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 domestic and foreign famous brands, to create a service industry gathering, theme-specific business center.
Not only that, Riiga Marina Aquarian Circle will also integrate ecology into architecture, oriented to TOD public transport, set fashion shopping, life services, catering, entertainment, education, sports in one unit, while bringing consumers the ultimate shopping experience at the same time leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "waterfront culture", combining shopping with water recreation and leisure.
In summary, it can be found that at present, some housing enterprises have learned about the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and industry insiders say that this consumer experience-centered consumption model, how to combine shopping with experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The current business circle is not only a scattering place of goods, but also a comprehensive place to integrate artistic culture and creative themes, as well as carrying responsibility for urban residence.
Therefore, in order to meet the consumer's food and drink shopping for one-stop material needs at the same time, maximizing the transmission of cultural and artistic multi-level spiritual needs, fulfilling the need for livable living, is bound to be the setting point for future business development.
In Chongqing, Jiangshan's northern bank is located in Jiangbei, close to the observation and sound bridge, a world-class business essence, international giants and others are flocking, first brand together, closely with international fashion.
It's a great place to walk, and it's the best of the world.
Dongyuan Jinyue has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinyu near the Nanping business circle, exclusive to the western and even the country's leading four-level three-dimensional transportation system, improving shopping comfort.
In addition, the greening of the garden and landscape pavements on two pedestrian streets in Huiyuan Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, planting about 300 trees, transforming the pavement for 40,000 square meters, improving the image of Nanping merchant circle;
Long Lake Yu No. 1, close to Chongqing's first low-density seaside merchant circle - Riiga Seafront merchant circle, surrounded by nine parks, low commercial block density, high degree of openness, so that people are more willing to stay when shopping, stationed, and slowly enjoy the fun of shopping, rather than being wrapped up in the back stream eagerly drive forward, really realized "walking shopping".
Today's commercial competition will only become more and more fierce, how to kill a bloody road in the serious homogenization market, win the reputation of future consumers " shopping holy places", worthy of all real estate developers to seriously think.
Only by the differentiation strategy is far from enough, only developers who really and rightly put consumers in the heart, rushed consumers, thought of consumers, to provide customers with an extraordinary and minimal shopping experience can laugh at the stormy market.
Of course, in the end I would like to be most pleased with the people of Chongqing, having such a good shopping experience and business circle, placed 10 years ago no one could imagine today's bustling.
Festival: Consumerism carnival masks real environmental prices
168.2 billion yuan, which is on November 11, 2017, "Titanic Double Eleven Global Carnival", in the 24 hours, the turnover of Tanta users consumption.
Specifically, after the "double 11" starts, a short three-minute stray cat turnover has exceeded 10 billion yuan, more than 20 billion yuan in 6 minutes and 0.5 seconds, and nine hours of breaking 100 billion yuan.
The total number of payments made by global consumers through Alipay reached 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 percent over the previous year.
This will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether it is the Tian Cat online shopping platform or Alipay payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun Ali Group.
Ten years ago no one would have thought that on November 11, the single youth created by self-taunting "Swordball Festival" subculture will be incorporated by e-commerce, becoming today's phenomenal level of "Double 11" shopping carnival.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the marketing gimmick for the first time: no one talks to you about love, then "single dogs" come online shopping.
The result is surprising, this day Taobao Mall (the "Titanic" precursor) transaction volume exceeded 52 million yuan, which was 10 times the daily turnover at that time.
Since then, "Double 11" has become the shopping carnival created by Alibaba, from the beginning of domestic buyers and sellers to self-entertaining, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years passed, dicytic "double 11" billion trading volume has been more than 3200 times that year, making Black Friday invisible.
There are also a number of e-commerce vendors with the "Double Eleven" promotion, among which "Jingdong" is strongest.
"Kingdong" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "double 11" impact, this year from November 1 to 11, "Kingdong" cumulative sales reached 127.1 billion yuan.
After the "double 11", followed by a similar "double 12" discount carnival, Christmas New Year shopping schedule.
After the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers there is also the pre-Spring Festival annual product procurement schedule, Valentine's Day shopping schedule, consumption, not holidays.
The environmental problems brought about by the massive consumption of instantaneous time have attracted attention from professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily Telecom reports, according to the usual standard of 0.2 kg per container in the industry, more than 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during this year's "double 11".
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control project at Greenpeace East Asia Division, told China-foreign dialogue that this year's "double 11" orders alone will produce 160,000 tons of packaging waste.
The National Postal Service released a report in 2016, indicating that the number of fast parts during the "Double 11" period (November 11-16) is about 780 million pieces, using more than 3 billion weaving bags, 9.922 billion boxes, 16.985 billion meters of tapes, the length of the tape can be around the Earth's equator 425 circles.
This year, the National Post Office expects "Double 11" fast-track operations to exceed 1.5 billion units.
Wang Xi, a waste incineration center manager in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that after the "double 11" daily entry of garbage is more than 2000 tons, and also exceeds the processing capacity of incineration stations.
The courier company has realized that the environmental pollution caused by the courier industry is incalculable.
Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced recycled reusable plastic courier boxes, recycling bags that can be repeated as shopping bags and garbage bags, but the perceived consumer acceptance is not high.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics".
This microblog has harvested more than 68,000 "favorites".
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Zimbabwe: The mobile payment battle, opened in Germany, is unintended.
WeChat Alipay and Alipay just moved the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, snatching positions has not changed - Chinese, this is also globalization.
Where there is an Alipay, there will be a WeChat payment.
According to the agreement with German e-payments service provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially started landing in Germany in November this year and gradually arranged for merchants within Europe.
This foreign reunion of the two "homeland" took place in Europe.
Alipay and WeChat have been paying all the way along the path of globalization.
For the way China's mobile payments are globalized, Ailey Consulting "China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017" summarized in two ways: one through strategic investment, experience output, equity and support of foreign domestic mobile payment enterprises.
Secondly, through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, to promote mobile payment services to foreign merchants, and thereby change the recognition and acceptance of mobile payments in China.
Indeed, the Chinese are subdued.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with large population base numbers, Chinese tourists spend in Europe is a tempting figure.
But it is also destined that this time the China Mobile Payments War, which has been opened in Germany, is unintended.
WeChat Alipay and Alipay are just moving the battlefield to Europe, competitors have not changed, or looted positions have not changed - or Chinese, it is also globalization?
A more groundbreaking discussion is whether China's mobile payments can open its own territory in Europe?
Take Germany as an example.
The "new retail" of magic.
Chen Xin Lei, Yang Connot: Amazon announced its entry into bookstores and grocery stores as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, regardless of timing or motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two booksellers in Portland and San Diego.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its storefront in New York and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go) is piloting operations, customers do not need to queue up in the store, and do not need to close accounts, enter the door sweep code, get the desired goods away, the amount of shopping will automatically be deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
In terms of Amazon, it's a very unexpected thing to suddenly move around the physical store in recent years.
As early as 2007 in the Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that Amazon would not easily open a physical store unless it met the following four conditions simultaneously:
1.We must be sure that this new opportunity will give the shareholders a return on their investments;
2.We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the entire company;
We must be sure that this new opportunity is overlooked by the market.
We must be sure that in this market we have sufficient resources to differentiate our customers.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the most shaky classification of both physical retail, and Amazon's first-ever downside.
Amazon announced its entry into both entities as it squeezed into the world's top 10 retailers, regardless of timing or motivation.
Is Amazon's approach contradicting the pledges made in its letter?
Similar voices were heard at the other end of the Earth. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunhing Congress, Alibaba Board Chairman Ma Yun delivered a keynote speech.
"From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and there will be no e-commerce in the next decade or twenty years, replacing it with "new retail."
"Online offline and logistics are combined to create new retail."
One time, the three words "new retail" were magically spelled out and hung on the mouth of industry people.
What does "new retail" mean?
If only the point line is combined with the offline, then the concept is not novel.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked the 180 largest e-commerce operators and estimated that total e-commerce sales were about $200 billion, with the top 25 accounting for more than $159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 were traditional retailers that only started operating online in the last five years (Mexican department store, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
And Alibaba Group 28.3 billion yuan in stock of Suning cloud merchants, and also has history.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers physical stores, e-commerce, mobile devices and socialized media.
Is Ma Yuntai's "new retail" more a summary rather than a vision for the future?
If not, then what is the difference between the whole channel concept and "new retail"?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether or not online and offline will converge, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years in retail, e-commerce's rise is similar to that of early discount retailers with a focus on prices and convenience.
By relying on these two pain points, e-commerce moves products with very high standardization, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the cultivation of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce has also stretched the angle to other categories, and began to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Jing, "using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing total of about 30 trillion social retailers, so that the growing consumer demand in China can be effectively met, so that the entire process of commodity production, circulation, service is made more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the e-commerce road is a surface light asset, real heavy assets road.
"Light" refers to fixed assets, staffing, management processes and other burdens without the traditional retail industry; "heavy", refers to the need for huge input in logistics, warehousing and other aspects.
Changes in logistics methods ensure the high efficiency of e-commerce.
According to the Chinese government network, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council held a permanent meeting of the State Council on April 28, which considered that expanding domestic consumption demand is an important initiative for steady growth and restructuring.
The meeting determined that specific programmes should be developed on the basis of scientific assessments.

On January 18, Alibaba held a high-level dialogue on e-commerce poverty alleviation in Chongqing, and announced that it will promote accurate poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring the new model of "Internet + poverty alleviation".
After proposing a rural strategy, launching the rural Taobao project, on-line Hing Farm Poverty Alleviation Platform, and establishing Alibaba Poverty Alleviation Fund, Ali has once again "added code" against poverty alleviation.
Poverty-reduction is one of China's most important national strategies.
Comprehensive poverty alleviation has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
"E-commerce poverty alleviation is an innovative initiative to develop a new round of poverty alleviation, and it is an important catcher for achieving accurate poverty alleviation and precise poverty alleviation.
The Central Committee attaches great importance to and points out that the role of the Internet in promoting poverty alleviation can be played, promote precision poverty alleviation, accurate poverty alleviation, and allow agricultural products to get out of the countryside through the Internet."
Therefore, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, with big data cloud computing and globalization and listed as the three core strategies of Ali for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched a rural Taobao project to recruit "small villages" in the countryside, leading farmers through e-commerce to get rid of poverty and become rich.
In 2017, Ali collaborated with the business sector to create Hing Farm's Poverty Alleviation Channel, and currently has a cumulative reach of 13 provinces across the country and 120 nationally poor counties.
There are already 2,118 Taobao villages created by the Ali platform.
Nearly 400 of these were in poverty-stricken provinces and 33 in poor counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, on Alibaba China retail platform, the national sales of Taobao Village reached 120 billion yuan.
Zhang said that in the face of the national strategy for poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Alian economy to get a new way out of poverty.
Among them, village Tao is the main carrier platform for Ali e-commerce to get rid of poverty, and has passed a new link to direct supply and direct sale of the Internet to get rid of poverty.
In the planting link, village Tao and ants gold uniforms jointly carry out agricultural machinery and microcredit support.
In 2017, out of 832 poor counties at the national level, Ant Goldsuits served 795 and provided convenient payment, credit and other services.
Cuisine Birds solve warehousing and logistics, T cat is responsible for sales, Aliyun's big data feed guide agricultural production, further improve the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce to eliminate poverty requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Ali opens e-commerce courses through Taobao University to teach farmers the standardization, quality and scale cultivation methods, realizing the combination of "poverty + mentality", so that farmers can be sustainable out of poverty.
These courses have already covered about 92% of the country-level poor counties.
And the idea of "public welfare mentality, business means" to eliminate poverty can also ensure that Ali achieves "true poverty alleviation" in poverty alleviation.
Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors, has said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth creation.
Poverty alleviation is the feeding of fish, poverty alleviation is the giving of fishing, enrichment is the creation of a "fish pond" for farmers to have fish.
The poverty alleviation of the industry driven by e-commerce is to make fish ponds.
In the case of industrial poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Lochuan cooperatively created the Lowchuan Apple industry poverty alleviation model has been replicated and promoted by relevant departments throughout the country as an example.
Ali e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been recognized at the decision-making level.
The e-commerce enterprises represented by Alibaba have been sent to ensure that farmers increase their production and income through online and offline channels.
Some of the village small and ant goldwear employees were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experience in e-commerce poverty alleviation.
At present, the Office of the United Nations World Food Programme in China has been working with Village Tao to promote poverty alleviation in e-commerce and other places such as Anhui.
The Third New Economic Think Tank Conference, co-organized by Ali Research Institute and China's Foresight Think Tank Forum, was held on January 16. Zhang Li, director of the E-Commerce Institute at the Ministry of Commerce &apos; s Research Institute, attended and made a statement.
She believes that globalization overlooks the most important issues, namely the physical and use of globalization, as well as the stages of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stalled and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes towards globalization in the new phase.
The second concept is the question of the mid-term stage of globalization, and what constrains it?
The economic and environmental foundations are constrained by globalization as a result of changes in the economic base.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment at the end of 2017 is basically over, and after 2018 it will enter a new round of growth period, with the next round of growth bound to be driven by raw products.
7FRESH, the first fresh food supermarket in Jingdong recently officially opened and plans to lay more than 1000 stores throughout the country in the next three to five years.
Together with Ali's box horse freshman, the eternal superspecies, Suning's souvenirs, and the company's palmfish raw materials, "new retail stores" began to pile up and appeared in innovative models and even priced each other.
Emerging supermarkets fight for the war and upgrading, has become a phenomenon-level topic in the new retail field, where is the new retail?
"In 2018 we will quickly enter the country, and before Spring Festival a large number of stores will be opened in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou."
On the 10th of the second meeting of the new retail summit, Box Ma Xinxin CEO Hou Yi revealed the "new gameplay" of 2018.
"Starting in 2018, the box horse is not just a fresh e-commerce provider, but a life-class e-commerce catering to consumers' instant service.
The core mode line is traction, experience, and the online is real sales."
Different from the traditional large-scale stores, supermarkets, box horses are born in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and enjoyable "red red shop", even intermediaries have set out the concept of "box area room".
The online e-commerce platform and offline retailers each have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are appearing in many channels, so both sides are trying the whole channel mode.
In the industry, it is believed that in the context of consumption upgrades, there will be more and more "box-horse" stores in 2018.
From the initial blossoming to more consumer areas, Box Horses are predicting that in the new year there will be more innovation in the retail market.
"For example, the combined business model of online and offline attracts consumers' eyes, and fresh supermarkets everywhere are called up.
"But these relationships say more, no longer showdown is useless, and finally realize that you have not brought a good experience to consumers, I experienced it well to be willing to pay."
According to Yuen Bin, the co-CEO of Dalong's new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and purchasing needs have changed.
The original pure line, the line is cut off, the line to defeat the line, the line to counterattack the line, now it is a handshake together, because consumers have no distinction between the line and the line.
The capital scramble into the market, so that the new retail fury currently represented by fresh supermarkets is full.
The analysis believes that the current competition of new retail in first-tier cities is far from the Red Sea pattern, and there are still large numbers of second-tier cities to be mined, market still has great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for the layout of new retail, will bring the development of new retail to a diversified state of development.
The CCTV Finance and Economic Channel unites the Financial and Economic Strategy Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, giving you a piece of dry goods, which is this dim annual development report for China's e-commerce industry.
What kind of transcripts has the Chinese e-commerce produced this year?

Total sales re-recorded growth rate back to accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales volume can be said to have been showing ultra-high speed growth, and it is estimated that there will be a feeling that Internet shopping is very fresh, not out of the house can also buy things, too cool!
But since 2013, the growth rate of online retail began to fall below 50%, in 2015, the growth rate for the first time was less than 40%, and in 2016 it has become 26.2%.
But this year's situation is different, and online retail sales have reaccelerated to 34.2% in January-September.
Much higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.
Perhaps everyone turns around in the outside, discovering or buying more people's physical and mental pleasure.
Among them, physical goods online retail sales amounted to nearly 5.08 trillion yuan, and service online retail sales amounted to almost 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share of total retail sales of social goods reached 13.6%, a year-on-year increase of nearly three percentage points.
Students, don't get dozed, focus on, service online retail sales is definitely a big feat!
Secondly, French netizens who love to cut hands, the per capita amount of Internet purchases is 1925 dollars, and their most shopping goods are clothing, deservedly a country of fashion.
What is your favorite online shopping, must you be a young man?
Helps you avoid the company becoming the next Uber startup
Amy Errett once wanted to investigate the happiness of her employees in her e-commerce startup, but it didn't work.
The responses received are often incomprehensible, useless, and even worse there are deceptive replies.
Even though she promised anonymity, some employees still distrusted the process.
Errett is responsible for managing 75 San Francisco e-commerce escort company Madison Reed, who said "the responses received are lacking consistency and objectivity."
So she called for help.
A number of new human resources start-ups have sprung up, helping companies understand how employees feel.
They build and authorize software specifically designed to measure employee engagement, enabling companies to quickly conduct polls for specific teams and population groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors bypassing executives.
"Now you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company's Fitbit?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood startup Glint. The Glint software analytics tool is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said in three years, she used Glint to gain more insights into what employees think and feel.
In addition to the rapid investigation and polls of specific teams, Glint also provides a company's hotline on which units complain the most, which managers approve the lowest scores - which gives her insight into the cause.
Companies began to realize that they had to be skilled in controlling the company's workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber. Former employees of Uber previously published a blog post describing the harassment environment, and those speakers were punished by the company after Uber fell into scandal.
For startups like Glint, the company's desire to supervise is an inexpensive business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, by 2020, the global governance, regulatory and compliance industries could be worth more than $118.7 billion.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behaviors, saw an increase in interest and activity in this area during the Uber reputation was damaged earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "diagnoses" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view thermal maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report bad behaviors.
If the chairman is involved, then the complaint will go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinland, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: "Public opinion courts have usurped the powers of regulators.
If a company is found to treat employees unfavorably or behave immorally, even if regulators do not intervene, the company may face the high consequences of consumer resistance, employee loss and involvement in litigation, Quinland said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that spans more than 500 locations and employs over 25,000 people, has been using Convercent for over a year to make sure employees understand their work guidelines and working procedures and provide easy access to the company's headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report problems, they must find the company's headquarters phone number or e-mail, make formal complaints and hope that the headquarters will take them seriously.
This is often a fearful and disturbing experience, said Ruby Tuesday's attorney general James Vitrano, who believes there is no good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to find and solve problems previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices.
"I can understand the work experience more closely and 360 degrees," said Vitrano, who is responsible for Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Quinland said that after the bankruptcy of Anchoran accounting firms due to a breach of ethical standards in the Annan scandal, companies began to pay more attention to ethics, values and employee engagement since 2002.
But it wasn't until "social media" came into its own world that companies realized they couldn't stop their explosives from spreading virally online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for product use.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture capitalists who have already backed both startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital with its total capital up to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness between companies, cultures and venture capitals, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that today's employees have higher expectations for the workplace than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high-paying and interesting projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and spent their time in a company with positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel that their voices are being listened to and work they do is beneficial, they will be more committed to making the company successful," said Nina McCartney, LinkedIn's vice president of global welfare and employee experience. LinkedIn also uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; the company performs well when employees are loyal and respectful.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's not surprising that they look for financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have data on employee engagement.
However, unless the company's administrator takes action, these data are useless.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If the change doesn't progress fast enough, or if there isn't a bit of progress, it can lead to disappointment and drive employees away from the company.
Russell Lath, head of consulting business at Commercial Management Cottage International said: "If you want to ask for 4,000 suggestions, then you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations."
"Because if you don't follow it all, the employees will think, 'Do you really hear what I say?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why do I care?"
Emerett said Madison Reed, who now conducts a monthly employee survey, has been able to take action on the day Glint reports issues.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustrations due to decision-making speed and communication quality, she was able to solve problems by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees, and in the long run they hope to be able to make a shift in this industry that is famous for its high brain loss rate.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose talent," Vitrano said.
"If you lose your talent, you will lose your customers."
And when you lose a customer, you will lose the company."

NCAA cancels twice a day's training to extend the Bears' daytime training time
At about 11:00 p.m., UCLA football team members hovered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice area.
Some players have stripped off their shirts and exposed the camp's sweaty body after trying to train for the first day.
For a large part of the team, this leisurely few minutes is time to rest.
Players in the summer course will return to the dormitory after three hours of practice, then back at 6:30 a.m. Wasserman football center for the meeting.
"The next three days are a grind on these guys," Panda coach Jim Mora said as he was about to get into Tuesday.
The NCAA canceled two daily exercises (which were designed to ease the burden on players), but actually extended their daytime training time - at least before Friday's end.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. in order to accommodate a schedule that players have already squeezed out.
From canceling twice a day training to more one-on-one training, the Bears started training almost a week before last season, and Mora trained at Westwood's summer school for the first time in six seasons.
They plan to conduct 18 trainings from August 20, before starting a formal pre-match for the first Battle of Texas Farmers in September.
Morra said he supported the NCAA's rule-making adjustments, although this would add another item to the player's busy trip.
"Within three or four days, we'll put a huge amount of training on them, very challenging," Mora said.
"They've just passed, they're honking and they're all great kids.
"I think we'll have more time on Saturday, really great."
As soon as the camp is over, UCLA will stop training. This is not an easy task given the clear sights of nearby parking lots and Luskin Center. The Superior Hotel Luskin Center has been hurled across scale by football through the defensive net behind the gates.
Starting this weekend, Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits that once these rooms are empty during the season, there may be problems.
"We will take security measures," Mora said.
"It's a really worrisome issue. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in the room to record training scenarios is not too strong.
If you have a training videotape, it's pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and also take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will make the best use of existing resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about this.
We've made a plan."

AT&T has cancelled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei originally planned to announce the partnership at CES this week, and AT&T canceled it at the last moment.
In response to this situation, Huawei on January 9 responded to flashing news reporters that on January 9 local time in the United States, Huawei will publish new products and specific listing information to the U.S. market.
Huawei said that over the past five years, Huawei has demonstrated its strength by launching high-end products in the global and American markets.

Feng Xiaogang claimed that he treated the work as a virgin, learned how to make round pictures with the photographer, and even spent millions of dollars to let the photographer take a ten-minute test.
Facebook will launch fact-checking capabilities to crack down on fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential mischief articles to third-party testing agencies and show the results below the original post. Facebook, the world's largest online social network, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that Facebook will start using the updated machines to learn how to detect possible mischiefs and send them to Fact Verifiers, and may display Fact Verification Results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main points of spreading so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook has influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, where voters were rife with false stories before the French presidential election in May, and Germany first passed support for the fine plan ahead of the September elections, which would be fined if social media networks failed to remove hate messages in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-checking function test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook News feed product manager Sarah Sue said in a blog post: "In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact checkers, people also want more background to help them make informed decisions about what they read and share.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its "related articles" feature and make other changes to its news feeds to reduce fake news.
Creation of a drawing novel: The story of an English castle
Recently, the small Scotty Castle became a protagonist in compressed music films and at one point became a refuge for Mrs Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotty has witnessed a turbulent history of 700 years in the comfort of Kent's Berle River Canyon, and now it is an inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man with special interest in historical documents who keep their heads dragged).
"I can see the old people's handwriting 300 years ago, and I find it really beautiful," he said with full eyes.
"What kind of relationship is it that will let this letter fall into my hands?"
Throughout the Middle Ages until Edward's era, an English Castle read book recorded families in Scottney, each of which was made by different British future artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This isn't Royce's first archive-based book: He also wrote The Teeth and Other Stories of the Dead in 2014, a book inspired by the British Library literature that he completed with an uncontrollable passion for creation.
"I couldn't restrain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent working for Jacob in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprint!
And the letters have been smelly, because at that time you needed to ignite in order to be bright.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes people feel that they are also with us.
I like the archives!"
For those touched by the old paper, being supported by the National Trust and Arts Council of England and living in the castle for nearly four months ("To be honest, I've been a little bit long") seems fantastic and simply doesn't believe it is true.
Rogers spent days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, digging through the archives, exploring many treasures and ancient games such as hanging on the wall with a hyena head, and spending centuries of bottles in the mooring river.
He strolled through the land and ruins of old castles, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with painters who painted illustrations for his books.
Then at night he would "drink a whiskey and write."
Scotty's secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust only entered fully after the death of Elizabeth Hersey, her last successor in 2006.
Ten years later, when Roz arrived, the staff began to process the files, and he described them as "the nobles who had gone hundreds of years ago: 'Oh, put it in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the British Empire and maps of national boundaries: "You'll think that land disputes will be boring," said Roz, "but two families will have to fight for a birch tree."
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work are based on the castle as a starting point, and further study British history at a broader level, including The Laborer, which leads to a man who left the new castle for the 1381 peasant uprising.
"The story of the book, Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, chronicles a riot that took place in the castle in 1380," Roz said.
"The peasant intifada began in that area, and I think it was a good place to start the uprising.
Maybe these two are related?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the story's protagonist is Arthur Darrell, an 18th-century smuggler who was believed to be holding a funeral for himself by filling his coffins with stones (and after several years he appeared on the ground).
The Darrells is Roth's favorite Scotty Castle family: "These gentlemen seem to be rude, always borrowing money and spending money on something they can't afford."
Generation after generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome guys who know how to pursue women."
As his task ended in the castle, Roz began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the wilderness of Finland completing a drawing novel about "Elm?nm?ki", an early 20th century sanatorium, which was later slowly abandoned.
But Scottny has a special place for him.
"I'm sadly leaving," he said.
"It's like, 'Oh, I have to face the cake in real life.'"
According to the perfunctory news reporter, ZTE's intelligent car team is based in Zhuhai, and artificially man-made ZTE executive vice president Tian Wenguo.
Large-scale energy companies are all "conquerable", so who of the many energy companies in the world takes the most money?
Yesterday, the famous PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 rankings of listed energy companies in 2011, with U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil championing a market cap of $406.3 billion, followed by Chinese oil and Royal Dutch Shell.
Among the PFC's list, Sino-oil has been ranked twice in 2007 and 2009, with other yearly rankings all occupied by ExxonMobil.
Among the top 50 lists in 2011, three companies from China's interior have entered the list, along with No. 2 Middle Oil and No. 9 Chinese Petrochemicals and No. 15 of China's marine oil.
According to the PFC statistics, although current oil prices are far higher than they were four years ago, according to the CEO of the PFC Energy Corporation, there are many reasons for the low total market cap, mainly including the decline in North American gas prices and a low level of activity in global stock markets.
According to Xinhua News Agency reports, the heavy pollution weather in Beijing-Zinghai and its surrounding areas has further intensified from the 16th day to the 19th day, with a "burst watch" appearing in Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xinqiang and Handan 3 cities.
U.S. Amendments to Green Card Regulations
The media cites President Donald Trump's speech saying the United States will launch a new immigration plan to amend green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 people a year, with temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications subject to stricter regulations.
The new rule was proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers and achieve these benefits by changing how the United States is issuing green cards to other citizens."
The law would replace the current program and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and possess skills that are conducive to economic development."

In order to optimize the environment of the scenic area and build beautiful South Yue, recently, the "636" volunteer service team of the Southern Yue District Tobacco Bureau (branch) launched an environmental protection campaign.
The event was not only supported by all cadres and employees of the Regional Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired old cadres and family members to participate in environmental practices, three generations of young and young people working together, mountaineering forest protection, clearing garbage, for the construction of "beautiful South Yue" dedicated their own strength.
This volunteer service campaign is designed to protect the landscape resources of Nanyu, promote the concept of volunteering "care for others, care for society, care for nature", and also let the next generation from a young age accept fuming and pass on the virtues of volunteer service.
It is reported that since the "636" volunteer team was established in early April this year, a total of 16 members have been developed, followed by a series of volunteer activities such as visiting disadvantaged retail customers, helping tobacco growers to care for smoke leaves, and Yaan earthquake love donations.

Sex Robots Are Growing, But We Should Be Careful
Just as you don't think 2017 will be weirder, the field of sex robots has released a new report on technological developments.
Yes, yes.
Sex robots are a big thing now.
The Responsible Robot Foundation (FRR) recently released a report that looks ahead to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Shaki, Honorary Retired Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
"People are laughing at the back, but big companies do launch a lot of sex robots and we'll see more."
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflated dolls to robots, they have silicone skin, touch very warmly, and specifically use artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual responses.
Users can also "customize" their robots to meet their preferences, from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbingly, many robots with "personality" will make the "replicating gauze" look very advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots are able to come from definitions based on the characteristics that users consider attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion, which can preset personality traits, including a slightly shy "cold-haired fala" and the "wild Wendy" that is "happy with adventure."
"Roxxxy Gold robots have the personality that is as commensurate with you as possible," said True Companion's website.
So she loves what you love and hates what you do.
She was just like a normal man in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk and she can be "sexy!"
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of uneasiness - not just replacing real human relationships - but the humbling female traits and the hints of rape rushed in cold (interpreted as: resisting) fala are the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man's shaker stick on its website.
"If a woman has a shock stick, why can't men have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not simply a lover or just a sex toy.
Their emergence and growing maturity directs the darker and deeper parts of our culture: from perfect gender equality to subordination as an additional option.
Of course, most men don't have sex robots, and while the FRR points out that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still on the brink of consumer culture.
But what penetrates from the edge allows us to see the process of this era in which we live.
Many people were neither strange nor aggressive until free markets gave them the opportunity to become so.
These fine sex robots appear in an era where women's rights are threatened worldwide, and there is no coincidence that a White House president boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most chilly part of the TV series "The Story of Women" is not in realistic pictures, not in the hanging body, not in the eyes that were dug out, but in the overly real imagination.
The Republic of Kiribati is a leap, but it doesn't seem far away right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make the best technology possible to create the most authentic female body (although it's in terms of porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human sensibilities and imitate real human movements.
But frankly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can't break up or go away.
They have no recourse institutions or follow-up stories, absolutely no independence, and no possibility of breaking a complete enslavement illusion.
In other words, they are sexy slaves.
Or, according to the popular saying of 2017: make a woman.
The Great Wall tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite force fighting a life and death battle against monsters in the world-famous Great Wall to defend humanity.
The last issue of the fourth season has been recorded, "Running Boys" team leader Deng Xue on May 30 received a WeChat interview from Shenyang Evening Newspaper, Shenyang Net Reporter, from "Running Men" in "School bullying" to "joking villains" in "The Devil's Angel", and to "Dead Man" Chen Mei, Deng Xue gives the audience impression like "the transient star gentleman", constantly changing.
"On the show, the same thing I won't do is constantly updating."
Trump's great performance?
Mitt Romney is a snapshot of common sense
Political divisions have polarized U.S. voters and, from a microscopic point of view, undermined American family harmony. This is no wonder for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers filled the comments column with fears of how to deal with Trump's relatives.
We usually think that we're doing our best to pierce our "filtering bubble."
Less commenting is the power of Trump to unify his family.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been dissenting with the Republicans of our home, is coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminds me that uniting against common enemies can produce strong results.
Because of working with Trump at the White House, everyone she knows, even Republican relatives who have been in political quarrels for decades, is now suddenly and strangely standing on the same front.
This is certainly a good thing if it's all at the table, but I am shocked that from a broader perspective this poses significant risks.
While left-wing figures have long been encouraged by Trump, the warping effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the possibility of worrying that his eccentric behavior might someday stop.
Still, there is a more worrying long-term scenario where Trump wants to "normalize" his relationship with right-wing Republicans who have previously opposed Mr. President's standards and now suddenly appear to be symbols of reason.
I have recently discovered some of my own odd memories of Mitt Romney's epilepsy: Putting dogs on the car, a 14% income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), for the crimes of these two moves seem to be really too minor compared to Trump.

Can creamy meat, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare in your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve associated symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The disease has a life impact on about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, resulting in stomach cramps and bloating, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers found that protein's key amino acid - thalamine helps promote immune cell growth, which enhances intestinal resistance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explains that the immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microorganisms hidden in food don't sneak into the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced between the cells that promote tolerance, protecting the body without harming various sensitive and vulnerable tissues.
When the equilibrium state is too biased toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the experiment, a cell that promotes immunity appears in small rat with special bacteria.
Bacteria require thyramine (one of the components of protein) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Kolner said: "We have established a link between a bacterial population (Lactobacillus Roy, which is the normal part of the gut microbiome) and cellular populations that promote tolerance.
The more thysamines are ingested by small white rats in their diet, the more they have immune cells.
He suggested that if humans use the same method, i.e. a combination of Lactobacillus and a thysamine-rich diet, it could form a more resilient, less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that boosted her endurance when she found a group of mice studying such cells, but another group of the same strains did not breed separately.
She suspects this discrepancy is associated with the gut microbiome of a rat (which refers to bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in small mice found that six bacterial populations were present in mice with immune cells, but not in small mice with no immune cells.
Small white rats are fed in a sterile environment, so they lack gut microbes and can't appear such immune cells, with the presence of Lactobacillus producing immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers trained Lactobacillus in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of non-bacterial fluid to undeveloped immune cells isolated from cubs.
The immune cell develops into a resistant cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that this active ingredient is a byproduct of the metabolism of thyrinine, called indole-3 lactate.
When the researchers doubled the number of therains in mouse feeds, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the level of theranic is halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like mice, have the same resistant cells and most of us have leukemia in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether humans can induce cell development like mice in the experiment with theranic byproducts from Lactobacillus, is not yet known, but genetic defects associated with theranine have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells may be the result of what we want, because they can control the inflammatory response on the inside of the gut," she says.
It can be inaccurate to say that high levels of thalamine in Lactyl bacillus may lead to an increase in the number of species.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United signed "genius" Nemania Matic
On Wednesday night, after Nemania Matic made his first appearance in the Sampdoria antagonism, Mourinho decided that Manchester United had signed a "genius" midfielder.
Matic from Chelsea, with a contract of up to PS40 million, played 2-1 in the final preseason ahead of Dublin's Euro Super Cup against Real Madrid, winning Paul Bogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, during the pre-Bruise Asian Tour, Matic was severely underweight and only completed 45 minutes of time, with Mourinho admitting that improvements were needed before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence and the way genius thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready as soon as possible."
Mourinho began scheduling his first lineup at the beginning of this season. Like Matic, new signers Victor Linderov and Romelu Lukaku also started playing at the Injevo Stadium.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still hopes to introduce three additional signers, but he insists the club is "excellent," with four of his preferred signers in mind, and the club has already introduced three of them.
"The club introduced three of these signers, and I am very grateful," he added.
"If the club can bring all four players in, I would be more happy, but they've done a lot of work for me."
Is China going to fall behind if it doesn't build this type of warship?
As the world's major naval powerhouses have recently announced plans to build new frigates, as if one night a frigate has become the focus of the attention of the powerful Navy, first Japan in the defense budget for 2018 determined to purchase two new frigates, so that the Japanese DEX frigate plan finally made a substantive breakthrough, then Lockheed Martin recently published the latest program of the U.S. FFG frigate plan, then where is China's new frigate?
With the downfall of a new Type 054A frigate at the end of 2017, marking that the 054A frigate has built up to 29 ships, has approached the sum of the 053H series frigates, and since the first 054A drop in 2006, the construction of the 054A has been for 12 years, even worldwide, building so many high-performance generic frigates, besides China, only the "Peri" class frigates built by the United States in the last 1970s and 1980s can be compared.
The reason why so many 054A are built is also simple, which is affordable, useful and complementary to the Navy's debt for years.
The 054A frigate has been favored by the Chinese navy for many years with a high cost and good combat capability, its displacement of about 4,000 tons, equipped with a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of seared flag-16 and fish-8 antisubmarine missile joint launch system, eight eagle hits 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was started in 2006, design time is more than an early ship, but its fighting force even if put into today is not too bad, look at the world's frigate can reach the middle level.
But after all, this is the first type of ship designed in the early 21st century, weapons configuration aside, its power systems and electronic radar equipment are already a big gap compared with the current world mainstream frigates, such as Europe's similar types of frigates have been equipped with full-power propulsion, small multifunctional phased array radar, large helicopter deck case, it is time to develop new models.
So to say how China's new frigate should develop, this is directly related to its future positioning and our strategic approach to the Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy will be completely transformed into a blue water navy, and the future will also be to the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas closely related to China's vital interests, showing the presence of force, if necessary, can have strong fighting force to ensure that China's vital interests in this area are not corrupted, so it seems that the new type of Huweijiang will be headed towards large-scale and far-reaching development.
Again, look at the positioning problem of the new frigate in future Chinese naval sequences, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy, in addition to the necessary near-sea defense ships, other major ships will form aircraft carrier combat groups or amphibious attack ship strike groups according to the situation needs.
The role of a new frigate in the future carrier battle group should serve as an anti-submarine mainstay and positioning for space disembarkation in the Middle and Near Area, in the amphibious attack ship strike group should act as a frigate class, so according to such needs, the new frigate must have strong anti-submarine capabilities and good medium-range space disembarkation capability.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly envision the possible appearance of future domestic frigates.
First of all, the drainage capacity relative to the current Type 054A frigate will have a significant increase, estimated that the displacement of new types of frigates will reach about 5000-6000 tons; the power system will adopt an integrated electric propulsion system consisting of a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30 knots, and the durability will also significantly increase; As for the weapons configuration of 76mm main gun and 1130 near defense cannon should be retained, but would add a red flag 10 launch system, behind the main gun there should be a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improvement and fish-8 joint hair loss system, in the rear of the ship should be equipped with an 8-16 unit large hair loss system for launching Eagle Strike 18 and new cruise missiles; the warehouse and downtime platform will also increase, reaching the suspension and storage of two 10ton helicopters; as for electronic radar systems, high-fitting words should be equipped with a small four-sided fixed phase control array radar based on 346A development, low-fitting words can be used similar to European frigates.
The overall level of such a new type of frigate will reach the current world standard, even compared to the US FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only the author's guesses about the new frigate of domestic origin, and we can only wait until the new frigate goes down to find out exactly what it means.

In recent years, my city encourages enterprises to actively participate in the construction of national, industry standards and regional group standards, give 300,000 yuan reward to companies that are mainly or participating in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, pay 500,000 yuan bonus to enterprises certified by Zhejiang manufacturing brand, is the highest level of this award in the province, stimulated the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in the benchmark.
Recently, Wang Li Group production workshop, the head of the group system Gao Jian together with employees is packing a series of anti-theft security door seal boxes, as part of the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard for marking work samples, ready to send to Shaoxing quality testing center.
Just two days ago, Wang Li has passed the "Zhejiang Manufacturing" certification expert group on-site audit.
Gao Jian said that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations praised the Group's achievements in high quality, independent innovation and other core aspects, agreeing to be fully matched, as long as the product passes through testing, Wang Li will become one of the first enterprises to pass this standard.
Wang Li Group is just a shortcut of standard prism for industrial transformation and upgrading.
Our city in parallel with the implementation of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards for benchmarking and compliance work, as well as stepping stars and clusters.

China's household debt rate close to the U.S. Is it even more scary than not buying a home?
Recently, everyone has been discussing what recent changes in real estate policy, whether the real estate policy should be loosened again? Land policy supply subject diversification, will there be a decline in house prices?
But when we are worried about the price of real estate, worry about macroeconomic regulation, worry about the future trend of the real estate market, "People's Daily" wrote again, last time we specifically discussed the "People's Daily" comment on the adjustment of real estate regulation, and now "People's Daily" writes a more serious topic than not to buy affordable housing, that is, even if you can afford the house, can you afford the debt?
Today, we are going to talk about a more serious problem than buying a home: loan repayment.
China's Growing Housing Debt Crisis
The Overseas edition of the People's Daily published a review article on January 17 "The joy and sorrow of struggling young people", according to the data in the article, in November 2017, the third quarter China deleveraging process report released by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center pointed out that the leverage ratio of the residential sector continues to increase, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points, increased by 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt in the entire real economy by the residential sector has increased, and leverage rates have risen more rapidly.
Research shows that China's household debt in financial institutions is dominated by consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of the population's debt, roughly twice as much as an operating loan.
Among them, in consumer loans, housing loans mainly accounted for about 80% of medium- and long-term loans, but from the incremental point of view, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt rate only statistics the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese families have many private loans including borrowing money from relatives and friends, there is a large-scale hidden debt.
Seeing such data can be a little stunned, according to statistics of the Suning Institute of Finance shows that in 1996 China's residents leveraged only 3%, and in 2008 it was only 18%, but since 2008, the population leverage has begun to show rapid growth, having doubled in just six years to 36.4%. By the third quarter of 2017, the resident leverage had reached as high as 48.6%.
We compare another data, and in May last year HSBC released a survey of nearly tens of thousands of people across nine countries.
The report was visited by young "millennials" in nine countries (born between 1980 and 2000).
China's post-80 and 90 youth housing ownership rate is as high as 70%, far ahead of the second Mexico (46%), which is also two times that of the U.S. target (35%).
These data tell us a very likely problem, that the largest potential "gray rhino" in China's population at this stage is estimated to be unable to afford debt.
Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious?
As we have previously analyzed, although we have been saying that China's home prices are higher, but compared to other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so rather than a high house price can not afford houses, I am afraid that now many friends will be asked the question is whether you can afford loans?
Looking around the world's real estate market, China's real estate market has not yet experienced a large real estate crisis except Hainan, as we said before, but just a decade ago in 2008, the origin of the global financial tsunami was the real estate crisis in the United States.
The reason for the real estate crisis in the United States is attributed to two houses: property and beauty.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their homes at a very low down payment to the low-income people in the United States at that time, when the U.S. economy went well, the real estate market was also a blissful one, but not long, with the growth stagnation of the U.S. economy, resulting in a decline in income for homebuyers, so large household spending began to fall.
However, when the current state of the United States was a part of the financial assets and real estate assets of the U.S. family assets, almost all of the household assets of the low-income group in the U.S. were real estate, while most of the top 20 percent high-income groups were financial assets, causing the more poor people's property in the U.S. to have higher debt rates.
A serious fact is that these people are all buying houses when the economy is better, so the money to pay for mortgages is also calculated based on their better income, when the income has fallen, the pressure on mortgages not only does not decrease or even because some subprime schemes have become float increase, and thus the real estate problem of these American families gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
So some people because the income is too low to pay for mortgages, so the bank began to take back the property, when the bank recovers from the arrears of loans buyers, they will sell at very low prices, which led to a step-by-step decline in the region's house prices, this process has provoked further downturn and formed a vicious cycle, when the house prices fell to a certain degree, more and more homebuyers find their house value even lower than their own loan, so there are more people stop continuing to repay mortgages, and caused more bad debt.
So, a huge vicious cycle forms this:
"The economic downturn - the decline in income - some people can't afford mortgages - low-priced banks sell homes for debtors - house prices fall - more people stop paying home loans - bankers sell again - house prices fall."
And the problem is more than that, because the house prices continue to fall, everyone stops lending home to the bank after you do not have a debt, if the money obtained by the bank auction house is still not your loan to the bank, then you still need to go back money, simply say suppose you use the down payment of 600,000, loans of 2.4 million bought a house at the time value of 3 million, when the price fell to this house only worth 2 million, you no longer credit the house to the bank, after the bank auction houses, you not only lost their own down payment of 600,000, but also owed the banks 400,000 debt, and you still have to return money.
So, just under such a vicious cycle, the U.S. economy is gradually collapsing and eventually triggering the 2008 financial crisis in the United States.
Therefore, the high level of China's household debt rate reached 46.8% at this stage is a very need for vigilance, this data in the current view is still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to appear, the country from last year repeatedly stressed the issue of deleveraging, which is a very prescient judgment, family debt if let them continue to climb, will inevitably cause huge risks, so it is necessary to prevent the emergence of financial risks.
So after that the house is used to live, not for scrambling positioning, the state has accelerated the establishment of multiple measures such as multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, rental and acquisition, and further eliminated potential risks.
For our individual family, we must abandon the real estate speculatory thinking, buy a house hard time, to avoid their own family into a huge burden, only a reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

White House Doctrine Costs Thousands
According to military records released by Time magazine, the White House last month decided to transport a Marine helicopter to South Lawn to highlight the great glory of American manufacturing, costing up to $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also referred to as Marine Corps 1) was an important exhibit at the U.S. construction project on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials scrutinized manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits include helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the troop Marine Corps First Fleet (HMX-1), which operates the helicopter, the White House military office asked the helicopter to appear on daily orders (FRAGO) - just 36 hours before it landed on the South Lawn for this "special" event.
The day before the event, HMX-1 commanders said in an email sent to a superior Marine Airborne Deputy Commander: "I just want to confirm that you are aware because this activity is highly valued."
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive on July 17 at about 7 a.m. in South Lawn for activities at 3 p.m. and leave after it was emptyed from 6 to 9 p.m. That same evening.
The information also indicates that in case the time to depart from the White House is postponed, the return flight is due to the time limit on duty requires a second group of crew members.
The former crew were on standby at the helicopter side during the course of the event, while security forces personnel were stationed near the ground when the aircraft was located.
The records of Time magazines do not clearly indicate whether the second group of crewmen will eventually be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 has asked if the activity violated the bill.
The commander wrote: "One of the questions we asked was whether this violated the Hatch Act and was told not to violate it."
"It sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines this "Made in America" activity as an official activity and therefore is not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the president promoted the topic of the Senate at that time: medical reform and touted control over government regulations.
It's no new to use Marine Corps 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes.
Presidents have been asked to travel on these planes.
But expropriating them for photographic purposes is not common.
Trump was concerned in February when, in Melbourne, Florida, the president's plane slowly slipped and ended up at the background of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was full of complaints about former presidents using the presidential jet.
White House Deputy Press Spokesperson Lynsey Walters said: "The White House is excited about the 'Made in America' exhibition, which showcases products from all 50 states that are made using American materials by U.S. workers."
HMX-1 crews routinely conduct flight training near the Washington area and on South lawns, practicing accurately relocating the U.S. president to the White House.
During Trump's G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 practiced 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the U.S. manufacturing activity flight was included in this month's crew training requirements.
Helicopter troops also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-presidential support missions" on the same day.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props in the event.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not maintain a budget record for the president's flight, so it is very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defense's 2017 hourly fee records, VH-3D's defense can be reimbursed at $24,380 per flight hour.
The troops recorded 30 minutes of each flight from a base at the Marine Corps airport in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that.
Walters said it was "very misleading to estimate the costs incurred by taxpayers based on reimbursable fees."
These estimated costs include the cost of personnel, maintenance and many other sinking costs included in annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Defense Department's reimbursable costs did not include personnel costs, but indeed included oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
Former White House spokeswoman Sean Spike defended the operation using the helicopter.
"Ideas are showing what is made in the United States this week," he added.
And I know that both Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of this, they've contributed a force to our national security, and I guess even if there aren't thousands or hundreds of people working on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of countless Americans who have worked tirelessly.
Therefore, it is certainly not untimely to demonstrate this."
We don't know if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he visited South Lawn during his event, but he did sit in the driver's seat for a fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump spoke to a representative of Sikorsky's company and joked with the media about his own airliner.
He said, "I know very much about the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

According to the market star newspaper reports, from 2005 to 2011, the GDP of my province was raised from the central parallel "pad bottom" to the second seat.
My province's economic growth still suffers from low investment efficiency and a lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest edition of the Economic Blueprint by the Provincial Economic Information Centre recommends improving the quality and effectiveness of its economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of my province's economy in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, China accounted for a significant proportion of high-consumption energy industries such as industrial energy and raw materials, which were greatly affected by market fluctuations and "double pressure" overcapacity, while home appliances, automobiles and other leading industries lacked innovation, resulting in slim profits.
And a large amount of investment does not bring corresponding economic benefits, which is the important reason for the low quality and efficiency of our economy.
In this regard, experts recommend that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprise innovation, and the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should also be "transferred" to enterprises in a timely manner.
For industrial economic efficiency is not high, experts say that it is also necessary to actively promote the merger and restructuring of industry, optimize the industrial layout, and extend the industrial chain.

The British General Trade Union (GMB) focuses on investments in the McVitie Glasgow plant
The union hopes that the management of biscuit manufacturer McVietah will guarantee a long-term commitment to production at Las Vegas plants.
The Scottish division of the United Kingdom's General Trade Union said it had been silent on the future of investing in the Tolcross plant.
The plant employs more than 500 people to produce products such as Hobnobs, Rich Tea.
Pladis S, owner of McVietah, said the company had invested more than PS5m in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if plant operations change, employees and trade union representatives "will be first to know."
In a letter to the head of the company, the Scottish division of the British General Trade Union called on McVietah to "solve the problem of unfunded modernization of production lines."
Drud Duffy, senior organizer of the British General Trade Union, said: "We can't get a clear understanding from the factory general manager about Tollcross's future business needs and investment plans, which is deeply worrisome to our members.
Generation-to-generation families work here, and the high concentration of local communities and labour in the Greater Glasgow region is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and severe social deprivation.
Therefore, in the context of employment, pay and economic prosperity, Brexit, rising cost of living and a long-term recession in manufacturing, Eastern Glasgow urgently needs Mveita to expand its production network."
A spokesman for Pradis said: "Tollcross's director just received a letter from the Scottish division of the British General Trade Union yesterday, and the company will respond immediately because we value maintaining continuous contact with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held regular meetings with employees and representatives of the British General Trade Union in Tollcross to discuss issues publicly.
We discussed with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and economicly uncertain environment, we reviewed our continuous operation model for applying to businesses and factories so as to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than PS5m in the Tollcross plant, especially in terms of production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the historical status of Tollcross as a production base, and if there are any changes in our operations at the plant, employees and union representatives will be the first to know."
On May 11th (reporter Chen Tao Bing) Deputy Director of the Sports Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region Nima Shijin said on October 10 in the heart of Mount Everest's North Base Camp that future garbage disposal will move from past public welfare actions to normalization behavior led by the Chinese government and international participation.
On May 10, environmentalists packed classified garbage into trucks.
For nearly a decade, with the rapid increase of Everest mountain climbers and tourists, environmental issues in the site of Mount Everest are becoming increasingly prominent.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibet Autonomous Region Mountaineering Association launched its first clearing campaign at Everest's north slope to clean up a number of living garbage such as oxygen bottles left in the 1960s and '70s.
According to Nima Zien, after 1997, the public welfare team cleaned up Everest's north slope, but most of the participants were non-professional.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago to sign Neymar.
Achilles may regret throwing olive branches at Marco Vilatti
After offering a PS189m offer to try to allow it to exercise the exemption clause, Paris Saint-Germain won't give up signing for Neymar, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of launching an offensive against the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer transfer window, and FFA Club is ready to break the world transfer record at two times more than the last transfer. Paul Bogba returned to Manchester United last season with a sum of up to PS89 million.
Once the transfer is completed, Neymar will jump to be the world's highest-priced player and also the world's highest-paid professional athlete - Paris Saint-Germain offering post-tax pay more than PS500,000 a week.
Barcelona is furious about Neymar's approach to attack and his way out, and sources familiar with the Catalan board insist that after he arrived from Santos in 2013, the club has done its best to take care of him.
But did the president of Paris Saint-Germain make such a prediction about the football world three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Bryce Matteddy in 2014, Nasser Al-Hellefi issued a harsh warning to any club that wanted to sign the best players of Paris Saint-Germain.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will certainly be hooked against them and we will also contact their players," Alkhlefi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they will also eat their own evil fruit."
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line and Barcelona threw olive branches at Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Vilati.
Paris Saint-Germain has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian national foot to leave anyway, and Barcelona is likely to be disproportionately affected by losing a talented Neymar.

"Sichuan Construction" of new energy vehicle retrograde financial subsidies weakened, charging facility penetration is not high, triple lithium batteries suspended in the use of new energy buses, facing the current upward pressure on domestic new energy automobile market

At the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British delegation achieved a record of 1 gold and 1 silver and 2 copper, which was their best track record since the first Winter Games in 1924.
Wales AM Worried About 'Like Stupids'
It was suggested that the title of AM should be changed to MWP (Welsh Councillor), which greatly shocked many AM.
This proposal was made because the plan would change the name of parliament to "Welsh Parliament".
Politicians worry that this will make you laugh.
A Labour Party AM said its members were concerned about "this name is rhymed with Twp and Pwp."
(Non-Welsh readers should know that in Welsh, twp means "silly" and pwp means "stool.")
A national party AM said the entire National Party was "unsatisfactory" and suggested it be changed to other names.
A Welsh conservative said the Conservatives were "open to" the change, but noted that it was easy to make MWP a muppet voice on the pronunciation.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to that of the Yorkshire English letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on the name change, said: "It's their own thing about what members of the committee ultimately decide to use."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 provides that the Welsh Parliament has the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published results of public consultation on proposals for these names and broadly supported the use of the name "Welsh Parliament".
With regard to the title of AM, the committee favored WMP (Welsh Parliamentarian), but the highest support rate was MWP.
Clearly, AM suggested the use of other names, but meeting chair Elin Jones was headlined by the delaying inconsistencies as he would submit a draft law on name change within weeks.
Legislation on reform will also include other changes in the way parliament operates, including rules for disqualifying AM and the design of a committee system.
AM will vote on the final name during the legislative debate.
Macedonia Holds Referendum on Change of Name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether or not the name of the country is changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The direct vote was to resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and neighboring Greece, with one province also known as Macedonia.
The Athens side has insisted that the names of its northern neighbors meant Greece had legitimate rights over its territory, and has repeatedly denied Macedonia's accession to the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who was opposed to the re-election referendum, said he would not be involved.
However, proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was just a necessary cost to join the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The church in Harlem is imperiled, and the bells of St. Martin's Church are silent
"Old people I've ever interviewed in history say there will be a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
"There is neither a bar nor a church here."
He said the bar's disappearance was mediocre.
"Today, people are starting to engage in socializing differently," Adams said.
"The bar is no longer a quarterly living room that people regularly look at."
As for the church, he fears that money to sell assets won't support as long as leaders expect "funds will be halved sooner or later."
He added that the church would be replaced by an apartment building, which houses people who don't help maintain the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of apartments purchased in these buildings will be white," he said, "so it will also accelerate the full closure of the church as most people who move into those apartments are unlikely to become members of the church."
The two churches were built ten years after St. Martin's church, and the Harlem area became a black metropolis (the metropolitan community of 1870) before it was built by white congregations.
The original White Methodist congregation was relocated in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying nearby took ownership of the building.
Under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation who led a campaign to boycott 125 Street retailers and 125 is a major shopping street in Harlem but refuses to hire or propel black people.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but as parishioners of Johnson's father planned to rebuild the church, they commissioned a bell ring.
The son of Johnson's father-in-law, the heir to St Martin's Church, David Johnson, arrogantly called the ringtone "the bell of the poor."
Professionals who played the piano in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The professional, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also points out that this is the world's first piano played by a black musician called Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a riverside church 18 years ago to play a larger piano.
Merriweather said St. Martin's church hadn't found anyone to replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom are brought by the church's mundane leaders, others by the parishioners.
The governing body of the parish (the parish council, composed of world leaders) wrote to the parish in July expressing concern that "the parish tries to transfer capital to the parish council," although the parish councillors would not be involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the functioning of the parish.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by sharks while diving to catch lobsters
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was bitten by sharks as he dived to catch lobsters on Saturday, the opening day of California's lobster fishing season.
The attack took place near the beaches of Ensinitas Beacon before 7:00 a.m.
Chad's Chad Hammel, in an interview with the KSWB television station in San Diego, said Saturday morning he dived with his friends and about half an hour later heard a boy shouting for help to drag him out of the water.
Hammer said he started thinking the boy was too excited to catch lobsters, but later he "realised that the boy was yelling, 'I'm bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire lockbone was torn," Hammer said as soon as he reached the boy.
"I shouted everyone to pull him out of the water: 'There are sharks in the water!'" Hammer said again.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where the situation is critical.
The types of sharks in the attack are unclear.
Salvation worker Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been found in the area several weeks ago, but it was determined not to pose a danger to humans.
Jars added that the victim's upper body was traumatized.
For investigative and security reasons, the official shutdown of Casablad's Ponto beach to Swamy Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Jars said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most do not pose a risk to humans.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will use the department store style of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to open a beauty channel with professional assistants.
With a large number of department stores entering the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, and this market continues to grow during the decline in fashion and homeware sales, it will be tested in 11 shops nationwide, if the test is successful, will be promoted to more stores next year.
Because supermarket TVs, microwaves and home appliances shelves were once indicted, the supermarket decided to invest in beauty products using these shelves space.
Serensbury department stores said it would double the size of beauty products by launching more than 3,000 products including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space to have brand areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its own boutique cosmetics series to make most of the products vegetarian - a requirement for more and more young shoppers.
In addition, perfumery retailer Fragrance Shop will run a franchise trial at two stores in Serensbury. The first opened last week at Croydon in southern London and the other would open later this year at Selly Oak in Birmingham.
The current trend is to shop online and buy a small amount of food every day in local convenience stores, which means that supermarkets must take more measures to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Serensbury department store, said the supermarket chain would offer more services and non-foods to counter discounters Aldi and Lidl, which would increasingly resemble department stores.
Since acquiring the two chains two years ago, Serensbury Department Store has been opening Argos stores in hundreds of stores and introduced some Habitat. The company said the acquisition boosted grocery sales and brought profits.
The supermarket has tried to transform the beauty and pharmacy before, but it failed.
In the early 21st century, Seansbury piloted a joint venture with Beauxseet, but after disputes over how to get revenue from Boxsee's pharmacy, cooperation between the two parties was terminated.
Three years ago, Seansbury proposed a new strategy to sell the pharmacies of 281 stores for PS125m to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
The company says Lloyds Pharmacy will add a range of luxury skincare brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, thus playing an important role in the program.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of business at Serensbury department store, said: "We have changed the look and atmosphere of the beauty channel to improve the environment for our customers."
We also invest in introducing specially trained colleagues who will provide advice on the spot.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every requirement, enticing environment and convenient geographical location means we are now a compelling beauty destination that will be a big challenge for traditional shopping.
After Holly Willoughby pulled out of a PS11m deal, Peter Jones was "very angry"
TV host Holly Willoughby quit a PS11m lifestyle brand business deal and instead focused on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, leaving Dragons Den star Peter Jones "very angry"
Wilobi has no time to invest in their home apparel and accessories brand Truly.
The partnership's business is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced his decision to withdraw at Instagram.
At the last moment, Holly Willoughby withdrew from a lucrative lifestyle brand business and turned to a rich new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which angered Dawn star Peter Jones.
Sources said TV Goldboy admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at the Marlowe Business Empire headquarters in Buckinghamshire that she had reached a new deal worth up to PS1.5 million, and after hearing this news, Jones was "very angry" because it meant she wouldn't have enough time to devote herself to their co-working home apparel brand Truly.
The business is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, which was expected to double Willoughby's estimated PS11m property.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was flying from the UK to his vacation home.
One source said: "Truly was Holly's first priority.
This will be her long-term future plan for the coming decades.
Her decision to quit shocked all the participants.
No one believes in what happened on Tuesday, because the eyes are going to be marketed.
Marlo's headquarters also have a whole warehouse of goods waiting for sale."
The exit of the UK's most profitable "This Morning" moderator, experts believe, could cost the company millions of dollars as it invests heavily in products such as mats, candles to clothing and household goods, and may further delay market progress.
This may mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Now three-child mother Willobby and husband Dan Baldwin, Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been friends for 10 years.
Willoughby and Capp established the Truly brand in 2016, with Jones, 52, joining as a director in March.
Both couples are always on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of his shares in Polwen's television production company.
Willoughby will be the spokesperson for M&S's brand and replace Ant McPartlin as a host of ITV's 'I'm A Celebrity'.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We do not comment on his business matters."
After a solemn conversation, "we loved each other."
He jokingly said that critics of the news media were deemed to have "lost presidential status" and praised North Korean leaders too much.
Why does President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump imitates the voice of "news anchors."
"I'm not sacrificing anything."
He noted that for the first time in June, two-state leaders met in Singapore and Trump praised the move as an important step towards denuclearization of North Korea, and now Kim Jong Un intends to hold a meeting again.
But negotiations on denuclearization are stalled.
After more than three months of the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Li Yonghao delivered a speech to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday saying that North Korea did not see the United States "respondingly" to its early disarmament actions.
He pointed out that the United States has continued to pressurize and impose sanctions.
Trump showed optimism in his rallying speech.
He said, "We're working very well with North Korea."
"If we are in a war with North Korea,
I'm afraid millions of people have died miserably.
Now, this relationship is good."
He said the work to improve relations with Kim Jong Un has yielded positive results, rocket tests have ended, hostages have been successfully rescued, and American soldiers' remains have fallen.
In addition, when he talks about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, he defends himself by special means.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of crowding more than 10,000 people out there into this crowded place, we would rather have more than 200 people standing here," Trump said directly in front of the crowd.
Indonesia's tsunami and quake destroyed an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, agencies such as foreign non-governmental organizations were told they didn't need their help.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population is displaced in Lombok, the Government has not declared a national disaster which is a prerequisite for launching international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they are very clear that they will not ask for international assistance, so this would be a huge challenge for them," Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children organized a team to visit Barru, but it was not yet possible to determine whether foreign staff could enter the field.
Sutopo, a national disaster agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Barru to determine whether international agencies needed to be involved in rescue efforts.
Clearly knowing that Indonesia may continue to suffer from an earthquake and face the fury of nature, Indonesia is still not fully prepared.
While Aceh has built a tsunami shelter, other coastlines have not followed suit.
Despite the fact that tsunami early warnings have come into effect, Barru's apparent lack of tsunami alerts may be responsible for causing casualties.
Even in the best-favourable circumstances, it is challenging to travel between many Indonesian islands.
Natural disasters have made logistics more difficult.
A medical vessel that had originally been stationed on Lombok to rescue earthquake victims was heading for Baru, but it took at least three days to reach the new disaster relief site.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's shattered infrastructure a core part of his campaign, and spent considerable money on repairing roads and railways.
But because next year there will be a re-election, funding shortfalls have plagued the government of Zoko.
Zoko is also under pressure from Indonesia's lingering sectarian tension, and most Muslim members have a more conservative faith.
The use of machetes, bow arrows and other scarce weapons by Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets has killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge wins the match against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge in London's 89th minute goal saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Stewart received a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri 30 yards from Chelsea's goalkeeper, when his team was 1-0 behind.
He gently passed the ball to the left, and then shot the far gate pillar.
When the ball is diverted to the upper right corner of the gate, it flies high above the forbidden area.
Kepa Arrizabalaga, who eventually crossed the jumper, fell into the net.
In an interview with Liverpool FC.com, Stewart said: "I just wanted to get into that position, control balls, then players like Shaq would push forward as much as possible, and I just made it possible for myself."
"I saw Kant come and touch the ball, but I didn't want to shoot too much."
After the 25th minute goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard, Chelsea midfielder took a 1-0 lead.
In that game, the Blues forward passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his footsteps and then dumped half of the defensive strike in Liverpool near the midfield.
Kowasic played a quick cross-sectional match in the middle.
Then, with a beautiful straightening, Azar was brought into the forbidden area.
Azal surpassed defense and left foot shots over Liverpool's Aliceson Becker, firing into the fargate pillar.
On Wednesday, at 3 p.m., Liverpool will play against the rivals of the Champions League in the Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet with Vidi Orton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London's UEFA Europa Leaguge.
Deaths from the tsunami in Indonesia have risen to 832
Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency said in the early hours of Sunday that the number of deaths caused by the Indonesian tsunami has climbed to 832.
Authority spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday reportedly triggered massive waves up to six meters (20 feet), causing buildings to collapse and many people trapped in the building's ruins.
The population of more than 380,000 people in Palu City is a rubble filled with debris from the collapsed building.
32-year-old man arrested by police for suspected murder of woman to death
This morning a female corpse was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside County, where police began investigating the murder.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews at John Street at 7:55 a.m. with traces of stab wounds and the man involved, aged 32, arrested for alleged murder.
Police are calling on the people in the region to furnish clues.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, and I call on the masses near Birkenhead John Street to contact us if there are any clues."
At the same time, I appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, if any clues are captured in the track recorder, please contact us and you have information that is critical to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the victims were locals in Berkenhead, and the bodies were found inside a house.
This afternoon, friends who knew the lady had rushed to the scene and asked where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just wanted to return to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one could enter or exit the building.
After he knew what was going on, he said nothing.
At present, residents have been notified and wait a few hours to get in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area had been classified as a crime scene.
A woman weeps at the scene.
He said in his mouth, "It's too tragic."
At 2 p.m., two police cars were parked inside the guard line and a van was parked outside the guard line.
A number of police officers guarded the apartment building in a wake-up call.
Anyone with information can send DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously (phone number 0800 555 111), referring to the September 30 record 247.
Cromwell's statue of parliament became the last monument to a "rewriting history" dispute
Clenwell's fanatical Puritan followers have carried out Taliban-style destruction of British culture and religious heritage, and exile is a deserved punishment.
But the Cromwell Institute called Crick's advice "extremely stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "The statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster will undoubtedly become an attack target in current debate over the removal of the statues.
The destructive idolist movement of the British Civil War was neither directed by Cromwell nor launched by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's biggest mistake was to be the victim of what his predecessor Thomas did in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's high-profile praise of Cromwell is a good proof of the 19th century proposition, as well as part of what many believe remains to be celebrated by Karenwell's history.
Kim Smith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cronwell is considered by many to be a defender of Congress's resistance to external pressure (in his case, the monarchy), who now think may be less than in the late 19th century."
Whether this expression is completely accurate has always been the subject of historical debates.
But it is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Clenwell was an acclaimed figure on behalf of a divided party.
The achievements of him as the patron saint are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killing pigs kills Chinese farmers
According to local media reports, in a market in southwestern China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to the South China Morning Post on Saturday, near a pig ring in a six-pack water market in Guizhou province, an Yuan surnamed man was found dead and his artery was cut off with blood.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farm in Xining City, China's Qinghai province, was preparing to give the pigs a vaccine.
The pig farmer and his cousin reportedly rushed to the local market from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin discovered that the pig had died and was close to the door of the pig house.
He said that there was a large pig in the swine circle, and his mouth was full of blood.
According to forensic evidence, the 550-pound fertilizer pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's leg blood and flesh is blurred, unbearable," said Wu's surnamed cousin.
The surveillance video shows that the Yuan surnamed man entered the market to feed pigs at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
But the fertilized pigs that killed him did not belong either to the Yuan surname man or to his cousin.
Market administrators told The Evening News that the fertilizer has been locked up to prevent it from attacking others again, while police are gathering evidence on the scene.
The family and market authorities of the man named Yuan are reportedly negotiating his death compensation.
Although rarer, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at a farm in Massachusetts, causing the two to suffer serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fertilizer pig pushed a Welsh farmer on the tractor until his wife came to frighten the livestock.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was swallowed by his own pigs, and a farmer in Lake Manitoba revealed to CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive but the smell of blood could act as triggers.
"They just like playback.
They're curious like kids... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
Hurricane remnant "Rosa" will continue to bring large-scale heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa continues to move toward the northern coast of Mexico, as forecasts have weakened after arriving in the cooler sea.
But it is expected that Rosa will also bring large-scale rains and flash flooding to northern Mexico and southwestern the United States over the next few days.
The center of Rosa is 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, with wind speeds of 85 miles per hour and a Category 1 hurricane.
"Rosa" is expected to continue northward on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean began to form a low tide eastward toward the west coast of the United States. "Rosa" will form a tropical storm on Monday, close to the Lower California Peninsula, when deep tropical humidity will advance northward into the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10-inch rain in parts of Mexico.
Afterwards, tropical wet gas interacts with the impending wave valley and will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause flooding, mudslides and even landslides in the desert.
The effects of deep tropical moisture will bring rainfall to a height of 2-3 inches per hour, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in parts of the south-west, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Due to the decentralization of tropical rains, flooding may occur due to rapid deterioration of conditions.
Due to the threat of tropical rains, desert adventure activities will be dangerous.
Great rain can lead to turbulent rivers in the canyons, with thunderstorms bringing local gusts and dust.
The upcoming Po Valley will bring local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coast.
The total rainfall may exceed half an inch, which can lead to slight mud flows and road slippages.
This will be the first rainfall in the region since it entered the rainy season.
Arizona will experience dispersive tropical rains on Sunday night and Monday morning, after which the range of rains between Monday evening and Tuesday will be widened.
The heavy rains will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder and tropical regions are still quite warm, temperatures across the U.S. will experience severe fluctuations in October.
This sometimes leads to a sharp change in temperature within a short distance.
On Sunday, there will be a huge temperature difference in the middle of the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Demein in Iowa, will reach close to 20 degrees.
In the next few days, there will again be a lingering heat wave, and the scope will expand.
It is expected that most of the central and eastern parts of the United States will begin to experience heat in October, with wide range temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City's temperature may also reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Long-term climate forecasts show that as of the first half of October, temperatures in the east of the United States were above average.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, hearings from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting herself in the 1980s, were broadcast on six television networks, bringing more than 20 million viewers to watch.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and broadcasters disrupt Friday's final turnaround of regular programming: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake promises to ask the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had drunk at a high school party, touched his body and wanted to take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh responded generously that he certainly hadn't happened 100 percent of the time.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people could watch the hearing.
The company is calculating the average rating of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channels and MSNBC.
Other networks that simultaneously aired the hearings were not yet available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen's company often encounters problems with the number of viewers in the statistical office.
Objectively, this number is similar to the size of a playoff soccer game or an Oscar audience.
Nielsen said Fox News Channel had a total of 5.69 million viewers on the day of the hearing, putting pressure on other online media. The viewer of Fox News Channel was a strong supporter for the appointment of Kavanaugh.
ABC followed, with a population of 3.26 million.
Nielsen estimates that CBS counts 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, attention remained high.
Flake became the core character of Friday's show.
Earlier, the moderate Republican made a statement in his office that he would vote for Kavanaugh. On Friday morning, when he boarded an elevator to attend judicial committee hearings, he was photographed by cameras from CNN and CBS with protesters shouting at him.
CNN saw in live broadcasts that during his condemnation he stared lowly and stood silently for a few minutes.
One woman said, "I am in front of you."
"Do you think what he says about the people is true?"
"You're in power, and so many women are powerless."
Before the elevator shutdown, Flake said his office had issued a statement that he would make further remarks in committee hearings.
The follow-up of cable TV and radio networks is being broadcast live, and the Judiciary Committee will vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full-fledged vote.
But Flake said he would only vote if the FBI did further investigations into allegations of sexual assault involving the candidate next week, and a handful of Democrats have been urging him to investigate further.
After a conversation with fellow Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake was somewhat convinced of this.
After a conversation with Kurne and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong, as it is clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Kavanaugh if they didn't investigate.
Trump has issued orders to the FBI to conduct a complementary investigation into Judge Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses commentators on Brexit "playing political games"
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her Brexit plans of "playing political games" on Britain's future and harming national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 for a Conservative Party meeting.
In another interview with the headline, former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson lashed out at his so-called Brexit plan and said the proposal that Britain and the EU should impose tariffs on each other was "truely absurd."
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Louisiana State University Player Gunshot Suspect Dyteon Simpson
Police have already arrested a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University, Wayde Sims, who has been shooting suspects.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder.
Police released a video of the two Sims and Simpson fighting, police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
CBS subsidiary WAFB reported that police found the glasses on the scene, saying they had found Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, police said Simpson confessed to the shooting of Wayde.
Advocate reported that it could cost up to $350,000.
East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office (East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office) released a preliminary report Friday saying the death was due to gunshot wounds in the head.
The Police Service expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police Service and regional citizens who assisted in investigations that ultimately succeeded in arresting fugitives.
Jo Alleva, a sports instructor at Louisiana State University, thanked the regional law enforcement authorities for their "work diligence and justice."
Sims is 20 years old.
Sims, six feet 6 inches (1.98 meters) tall as a forward, grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne was also part of the Louisiana State University basketball team.
Last season, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "sorrowful" and "difficult to accept" Wayde's passing.
Wade said, "This is the end we're most unwilling to see."
Category: Volcanoes in Mexico City
Volcano Popo Caterpete bursts and erupted ashes spread across the southern blocks of Mexico's capital.
Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center recorded 183 cigarettes in 24 hours on Saturday, and then warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the crater activity.
The Centre for Disaster Prevention monitored multiple rumbles and minor earthquakes.
Pictures on social media show that Hochimirco, near Mexico City, is lined with an ashes on the car windshield.
Geophysicists note that volcanic activity in the capital's 45 miles (72 km) southeast has increased since the September 2017 magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico.
The volcano, also known as the "smoking peak", has been in operation since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum, police clash with separatists
On Saturday, thousands of people joined anti-demonstration marches in honor of the first anniversary of the Catalan bipolar split referendum, and supporters of independent protesters clashed with riot police, followed by six arrests in Barcelona.
A group of masked pro-Separatists threw eggs and powder coatings at the riot police, causing dust on the streets that were crowded with tourists before being stopped by the riot police.
Later that day there was a mutiny, and the police used sticks to contain the unrest.
"Never forget, never forgive" supporters of the independents, and stand up to several hours with unifying protesters who chant "Long live Spain".
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for light injuries during the protests.
The referendum on October 1 in Madrid was seen as an illegal act, and a year later the situation remained highly tense in this secessionist region, but Catalan separatists were celebrating.
Despite the overwhelming majority of voters choosing independence, the voter turnout is still low as most opponents of the split refuse to vote.
According to Catalan authorities, last year police tried to block successive ballots at the polling stations in the region, triggering a violent conflict that resulted in nearly 1,000 injuries.
Friday night, supporting the sect's collective camping, stopping demonstrations and supporting the actions of the National Police.
Demonstrations continued, but had to take other steps.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protests, said there was no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year, we went through the best time in our lives.
My parents were happy to cry for being able to participate in the vote, but now we are in a dilemma," he said.
Despite the crucial victory in regional elections last December, Catalonia's support for independence this year is still trying to maintain its momentum, with many of the best-known leaders being either self-exile or detained for appearance during the organizational referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, 42, who recorded the protests on his phone to support police, said the conflict was incited by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders held in pretrial prisons since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"As a candidate for the European Parliament elections, publicly denouncing the Spanish government's regression in democratic ideas and repression will be the most favorable way," he said.
London Delhi County: Three Men Arrested by Driving to Shock Their Houses
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39) driving a car repeatedly hit a house in London's Delhi County, where they were arrested by the police.
At about 19:30 a.m. on Thursday, the scene was Ballynagard Crescent.
Senior police officer Bob Blemmings said the impact had damaged the gates and the building itself.
In some cases, there may have been interference with the car's crossbow.
Montana's goal helped the Livingston team 1-0 to defeat the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal was to win for Livingston.
Winston's promotion shocked the Rangers, and Steven Gerrard lost a second time in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal became a key win, and Gary Holt's team stalked the Irish in Section II.
Gerard's team is still not in the field this season, and they will be battling ahead with its eight-header Red Heart Team next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be in the Rapid Vienna squad of the European League on Thursday. Prior to this, the Rangers will play against Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the Liverpool team will continue its sixth unbeaten record in the field and head coach Holt hasn't tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livonston is very much a missed opportunity to fight with the enemy's team.
Holt's team already had signs of leading before the score, and their offensive brought a variety of problems to roamers.
Scott Robinson kicked the ball on the other side of the door, and Alan Lithgow was dragged to the edge after receiving Craig Halkett's head.
Host owners are very willing to play with the Rangers, because they know they can create problems for the team when positioning the ball.
This is how the key shotguns are produced.
The Cavalry lost an arbitrary ball, the Livingston team opened a vacancy, and Deklan Gallagher and Robinson together formed Monga, who received a memorable score from the forbidden zone center. The Rangers lost an arbitrary ball, Levinston broke the door, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to block Montga.
At this time, while the Rangers took control of the ball, they found that the main team defense is difficult to break through, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly basically has nothing to worry about.
This pattern lasted until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos snatched a ball from Kelly's feet.
Scott Pittman was stabbed by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgo kicked off another positioning ball for the Livingston team.
Crosses constantly enters the Livinston team's exclusion zone and is continuously derailed, while two penalty points - after Harcott proposed to bring a substitute Glenn Middleton to play and a handball - were kicked back.
Livinston's "Excellent Performance" analysis
BBC Scottish journalist Alasdair Lamont reported at Tony Macaroni Arena
Livinston's team performed superbly and achieved amazing results.
All of the players are very good at performance, once again surpassing people's expectations.
Since Holt's return to the top league, there has been little change in the style and staffing of the team, but Hallt's honor for the team is indeed worth noting.
He brought a lot of hero-like players.
Captain Harcott was unstoppable, deploying an organizationally strong defensive lineup, and Mongare did not let down Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the process.
However, the morale of the rover team is not enough.
They occasionally performed well under Gerard's leadership, but far from meeting the standards.
Their last ball didn't hit - they only cut into the main team once - which could be a wake-up call for midstream wanderers.
Erdogan is incomprehensible in Cologne
Saturday (29 September), the last day of Turkey's presidential state visit to Germany, was a thousand miles clear, and two leaders held a friendly breakfast meeting in Berlin.
President Erdogan's visit to Germany is controversial, and the mission aims to re-establish relations between the two NATO allies.
They are stalled on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan traveled to a new monumental mosque in Cologne.
Cologne, the Turkish city with a large population, is the most populous city outside Turkey.
Police on security grounds prevented 25,000 spectators from going to the mosque for a rally, but there were still many supporters nearby who welcomed the president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurdish, have also voiced dissent, condemning Erdogan's policies and deploring that the German government should not welcome Erdogan's visit to Germany.
The protests between the two sides reflect disagreements over Erdogan's visit: some German Turks call it a hero, while others denounce it as a dictator.
Detford Road Traffic Accident: Drivers Killed After Collision with Car
A list of car owners died in a crash in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. in British summertime, near the border between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy roadblock in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The car driver parked to see the rescue was carried out by medical personnel, but the owner of the bicycle had died on the spot.
Just a few months before the crash, on Hillders Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash, another car owner died in an accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the police were identifying the man and would inform his immediate family of the matter.
The road has been closed and the bus re-routing work is done, and it is recommended that drivers bypass the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Disturbations Injured Six Prisoners
The prison office said riots broke out in a high-security man's prison, and six jail officers were injured during the unrest.
At 9:30 a.m. on Sunday morning, the HMP Long Lartin prison in Woostershire broke out and the unrest was still underway.
The authorities dispatched a dedicated Tornado commando to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners, and all those involved are now in control of one building.
The prison guard's face was lightly injured and received on-site treatment.
The Prisons Authority spokesman said: "A staff dedicated to dealing with prison riots have been deployed to deal with the ongoing riots by HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured prison guards have been treated.
We will never tolerate any violence in prisons and we will hand over the perpetrators to the police, who may face longer imprisonment."
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, the prison chief was reportedly attacked by prisoners and sent to hospital for treatment.
In October, riot police were deployed to the prison to deal with major unrest and had been attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which arid areas may benefit from)
Tropical low-pressure attacks in Arizona are rare, but this is likely to occur earlier next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will attack the southwestern desert area and thus cause flooding danger.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for areas such as western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah (including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City).
Rosa is expected to arrive with rainfall later on Monday and cross over Phoenix on Tuesday.
"Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state within 200 miles of Phoenix!"
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane landing 40 miles from the Arizona border.
According to the latest National Hurricane Cente model, rainfall will reach 2-4 inches and local precipitation on the edge of Mogoron in Arizona will reach 6 inches.
Rainfall in other southwestern desert areas, including the central and large basins of the Rocky Mountains, is likely to reach 1-2 inches, with local total rainfall likely to reach 4 inches.
For areas that do not cause flooding risk, the precipitation brought by Rosa may be a luck because of severe drought in those areas.
While flooding has generated high attention, moderate rainfall may also be beneficial as the southwestern region is currently experiencing droughts.
According to Weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that more than 40% of Arizona's regions are experiencing at least extreme drought conditions (the second worst category).
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause it to land on Mexico's Lower California Peninsula.
Rosa is still in hurricane intensity on Sunday morning with the maximum wind power of 85 miles per hour, located 385 miles south of Cape Eugene, Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
Hurricanes were exposed to cool seawater on the pacific, and wind power was weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land from Mexico on Monday afternoon or at night with the intensity of tropical storms.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall may be high and there is a risk of flooding.
According to Weather.com, "total rainfall from the Lower California Peninsula to northwest Sonora is expected to reach 3-6 inches and possibly even 10 inches."
Rosa will then cross Mexico north in the form of a tropical storm, arrive at the Arizona border in the form of a tropical subdued air pressure on Tuesday morning and pass through the entire Arizona late afternoon into southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said: "The main hazard of Rosa or its remnants is expected to be heavy rainfall on the Lower California Peninsula, northwest Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert areas."
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening floods and mud flows in desert areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspected murderers arrested
A 16-year-old boy found a number of stab wounds in Somerset, after which the suspect was arrested on suspicion of deliberate murder. The suspect was three teenage boys and a twenty-year-old man.
The murdered teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4am Saturday.
He was subsequently sent to the hospital, and the current injury is "stable".
Avon and Somerset Police said the suspects (including one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old) were caught overnight in Radstock.
Witnesses who grabbed the live video with their phones were encouraged to provide clues.
Trump called Kavanaugh a "devil and angry receiver" for the Democratic Party
At a rally in Wellington, West Virginia, Trump said: "To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote against the ruthless and shameless tactics of the Democratic Party."
Trump said Kavanaugh "has suffered the despicable and anger of Democrats" throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh, in an interview with Congress on Thursday, emotionally strongly denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had not sexually assaulted Ford decades earlier.
Ford also attends the hearing on his charges.
The president said on Saturday that the day "the American people saw Kavanaugh's humane sanity and courage."
The president told supporters in West Virginia that "voting for Judge Kavanaugh is the legal sage who voted to recognize the most accomplished of our time, a well-known jurist in public service."
The president, speaking about the importance of Republican elections in midterm elections, indirectly slapped Kavanaugh's nomination.
"It's five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
"I'm not campaigning, I am running around like that.
"That's for you to elect a good candidate," he said.
Trump said the Democratic Party's mission is "resistance and obstruction."
A senior Republican leadership assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held in the Senate on Friday.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people, with the number of deaths still rising.
Indonesian authorities said on Saturday that a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island, killing at least 384 people, many of whom were swept away as the waves rushed to the beach.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Barru City for a party, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) rushed over the coast, causing many deaths and tsunamis.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Indonesia's BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a briefing in Jakarta: "When yesterday's tsunami occurred, people were active on the beach and could not escape in time.
"The tsunami is packed with cars, wood and houses that sweep all over the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami passed through the high seas at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed to the trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 evacuation centers in Barru.
Air photographs released by the disaster relief agencies show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges twisted, collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by seawater.
On Saturday, the aftershocks continued to disturb the coastal city.
This area, with a population of 2.4 million, feels intensely shaken.
Indonesia's Technical Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that Friday's earthquake unleashed the power of about 200 times more atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement also pointed out that the city is located at the end of a narrow bay, so geographical location may amplify the power of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were crushed under the ruins of the collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and destruction along the 300 km (190 mi) coastline in northern Barru could be even more severe, with the area of Dungala being closer to the earthquake.
Dungala's communications were "completely paralyzed with no news," Nugroho said.
The ICRC stated that more than 300,000 people lived in the area and added that Red Cross staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
"While it's already a tragedy, the situation is likely to get worse," said the Red Cross.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to inform the general public that the tsunami hit Baru, despite officials saying the tsunami occurred after the alerts were released.
In a video taken by an amateur who shared on social media, one can hear a man at the top of the building screaming madly at crowds in the streets below, warning them that the tsunami is coming.
After a few minutes, the water wall rushed over the coast and swept away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters has been unable to authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages that cut off communications around Baru, making it impossible for government authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Indonesian authorities say the military has begun sending rescue transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in Baru is currently reopened only for rescue efforts and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation center in Barru on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll has risen to more than 800.
It's really very bad.
Although the staff of the Dungara World Proclamation Association have arrived safely in Baru City, and employees are temporarily placed in a temporary cloth shelter built in the company's courtyard, they see nothing but spectacular sights on their way, says Doseba.
"They said they saw multiple houses being destroyed," he said.
It's really very bad.
Just as the rescue organization began this brutal battle and started disaster relief equipment, some complained that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were barred from going to Baru.
According to Indonesian law, the movement of funds, goods and staff abroad can be allowed only when the disaster scene is declared a national disaster zone.
But it has not yet been announced.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says 'this is a national disaster', we can let go of international relief, but the current situation is not allowed."
The next night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, in Baru, missing people's relatives and friends still have a line of hope that their loved ones can create miracles to add color to this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, rescuers salvaged a young boy from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was squeezed under rubble for two days while her mother's body was next to her.
Indonesian national parachute coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing parachute athletes to prepare for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped in Roa Roa hotels, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior athlete in the field of parachute, I have personal emotional burdens," he said.
Gendon said a few hours after the news of Roa Roa's collapse spread across the umbrella community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Baru rivals who attended the beach party.
However, his message always shows only a gray diagonal, rather than a pair of blue diagonals.
"I think that means the message hasn't been sent successfully," he said.
Thief stole $26,750 when Newport on the Levee's ATM billing
News reports from the Newport Police Department said Friday morning a Brink staff member stole $26,750 when he placed money in an ATM to Newport on the Levee.
Dennis McCarthy of the police department said in the report that at the time, the driver emptyed the entertainment restaurant's ATM and was preparing to add bills inside.
Just as he was busy, a man "run from behind this Brink employee" stole a bag of banknotes that should have been added to the ATM.
Witnesses reportedly found several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of persons involved in the case.
Anyone who can provide information about the identity of the thieves should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye Wester: The rapper changed his name to "Ye"
The rapper Kanye West was renamed "Ye".
He announced a name change on Twitter on Saturday, with the specifics: "Previously known Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been named "Ye" for a while, and he used the name as the title of the eighth album released in June 2018.
The retitle was announced before he took part in Saturday Night Live, and it is expected that he will launch his new album Yandhi on the show.
Producers say he replaced singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the program for "feeling reasons."
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional name as Wester, he has previously said that the term is religious for him.
When he discussed his album title with radio anchor Big Boy earlier this year, West said: "I believe 'Ye' is the most common word in the Bible and it means 'you'.
"So I am you, we are.
I used the name "Kanye", which means "the only one," and now it's called "Ye" that reflects our goodness, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is more reflective of who we are."
Many famous rappers have changed their names.
Sean Combs used many names, most commonly "Puff Daddy" and "Diddy", but this year he announced that he preferred the two names "Love" and "Brother Love".
JAY-Z, who previously worked with Wester, also changed the name by using hyphens or without hyphens and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO has solemnly declared that it will not use force against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador solemnly declared that no use of force would ever be used against civilians on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the impending student persecution in the country.
On Saturday, Lopez O'Frador promised in Tlatelolco Plaza that "there will never be any use of force to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, as the leftist student movement took root throughout Latin America, Mexican forces shot and killed up to 300 people during peaceful demonstrations in Plaza.
Lopez O'Frador pledged to subsidize students and open more free public universities in support of the development of the younger generation in Mexico.
He said unemployment and lack of access to education could lead teenagers to the path of crime.
The U.S. should double the A.I. funding
As China's research in the field of artificial intelligence becomes more active, the United States should double its research spending in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement is aimed at AI announcements made by various parts of the U.S. government, and the United States generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
China launched a plan last year that aims to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"All other countries are far behind the U.S. in this field, and we're looking for new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, so doubling AI research budgets will be a good start," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said a doubling in funding could double the chances that the United States would once again become an artificial intelligence breakthrough.
Lee's book, The Artificial Intelligence Superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published last month by Harcourt Press. Lee is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of China's most famous AI companies Face++.
In the 1980s he created an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, defeating top-ranked American player Ottolo, after which he became executive of Microsoft Research Institute and president of Google China.
Lee endorsed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics Challenge, and then asked what competition would be launched in order to achieve the next set of dreamers.
Researchers in the U.S. often spend a lot of money to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"Not China is snatching our academic leaders, but businesses," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university excellencies to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the U.S. strengthen its work on artificial intelligence.
"I think I should offer a green card to the AI doctor proactively," he said.
In July 2017, the State Department of China issued a new-generation AI development plan.
In the United States, U.S. researchers can receive funding from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, similarly in China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for academic institutions' researchers, but there is relatively poor quality of academic work in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia, in addition to the White House's announcement on the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it would invest $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
The U.S. legislature, which for months called for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not yet taken action.
Macedonia Holds Referendum on Changing Its Name
The Macedonian people held a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve decades-long disputes between Macedonia and Greece that prevented it from joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, retaining the name of its northern neighbors means that Greece has legitimate rights over its territory and has rejected its accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argued that changing the country's name would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not be involved in the referendum and boycotted it was doubtful whether the results would meet a minimum vote rate of 50 percent that made the referendum effective.
The question about the referendum is as follows: "Have you accepted an agreement with Greece for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU)?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that Macedonia is one of the countries deriving from the dissolution of Yugoslavia and seeks to join institutions such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
"I'm here today to vote for the future of our country and for the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means we all have a safer life," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, Skopje.
While not bound by the law, there are plenty of parliamentarians who say they will be decisively following the results of the vote.
However, the rename would require a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.
The state election commission said it had not received any reports of wrongdoing as of 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16%, while the last parliamentary election in 2016 was 34%, when 66% of registered voters were voting.
"I'm here to vote for my kids and we live in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum to change the country's name, paving the way for Macedonia's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union.
Before the Skopje Parliament Gate, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and moving his chair to a tent built by people who resisted the referendum.
"While it's for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), we want to join with our backbone rather than walk through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"While our country is poor, we have dignity.
If they don't treat us as Macedonians, we can seek help from other countries such as China or Russia to become members of the Asian-European integration."
Overall, Zaev said that membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would bring much needed investment to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most people will support the referendum because more than 80% of our population supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union," Zaev said after voting.
He said the "supporting" vote would "determine our future."
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute of Policy published on Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the required voter turnout.
Another poll by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57% of the respondents said they planned to participate in Sunday's vote.
Of course, 70% of the people said they would vote in favor.
For a referendum to succeed, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one.
The failure of the referendum meant that pro-Western government policies would be hit for the first time since coming to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City team Sergio Aguero Breaks Brighton's Strict Defense Goal
On Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, City's Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling double-crossed Brighton's defense with a final 2-0 win.
Aquiro's 65-minute goal looks very relaxing.
At the beginning of the game, the Argentine striker received a pass in midfield.
He quickly ran through the three defenders of Brighton and rushed toward the open area.
Then Aquiro found himself surrounded by four other players.
He pushed out a defender and overtook several defenders on the edge of Brighton's barracks.
Then the ball was pushed to the left and passed on to Sterling.
The British striker used his first touch ball in the ban area to pass the ball back to Aquiro, who shot the ball on the right foot and knocked down Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aquiro's foot was injured," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about getting him to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
He did it.
Luckily, that was the moment he scored."
However, it was Sterling who laid the initial advantage for Sky Blues in the Premier League.
The goal took place in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aquiro received the ball in the back of Brighton.
He passed the ball along the left to Leroy Sane in a pretty straight line.
After several strokes, Sarne led Sterling to the far gate column.
The Sky Blues striker easily puts the ball into the net before sliding out of the border.
On Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., Manchester City will compete with rival Hoffenheim in the Champions League team at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to fight the Rockets.
Due to the national team's knockout in the playoff race, there is no more reason to force them to start again.
Cheryl hopes to be the first in Sunday's match against the Colorado Rockies, but on condition that the Rockies are still immersed in the impact of the playoffs and lead a Los Angeles Dodgers ahead of National League (NL) West.
On Friday night, the Rockies defeated the nationals 5-2 and locked at least one foreign card spot, but they still wanted to win their first divisional championship.
"Even if we don't do anything else, at least we are able to play with Danfoe in the eyewitnesses and other teams will hit the highest level I am going to face this year."
How would I not want to play the game?"
The national team has not yet announced Sunday's first line-up, but it is reported that in this case they are likely to have Schezer pitched.
This will be Shazel's 34th debut, which he has already begun to practice pitching in the bullshed on Thursday and will play on a regular Sunday break.
Washington's right-handed player in the 222 and 2/3 of this season scored 18 wins seven defeats, with a defensive score of 2.53 for 300 triplets.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president, speaking about the importance of Republican elections in midterm elections, indirectly portrayed the situation faced by his elected Supreme Court voter Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we do is about the course of November.
It's five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
"This is a big deal, I'm not campaigning and I am running around so that you can pick good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You also see how terrible the Democrats are, and you can see it now."
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary, and you can see their despicable filth.
No matter who is hurting them, in order to take control of their power, gain control over whom they are stumbling on their feet, it doesn't matter that they have only power and control in their eyes, and we won't give them."
The Democratic Party's mission is "resistance and obstruction."
"You've seen this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democratic Party "irritated, shameful, deceitful and hypocritical."
He referred to the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Senate Judiciary Committee.
"Do you remember how she answered?
Is it a leaked file?
Ah, uh, what?
No, oh no, no, someone else gave me that body language was too clumsy and the most clumsy physical language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a holocaust.
Anyone who cannot be insinuated here.
I didn't feel strange when local Momentum party activists voted to denounce me.
After all, my Labour MPs finally learnt that they are not popular with the lawmakers and why they are unpopular because we express our thoughts.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated for his resolute opposition to anti-Semitism.
The criticism of my motion was because I objected to Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar problems have emerged on issues related to responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, in which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
In a notice of the Northingham Eastern Labour Party meeting on Friday, he said: "We hope that it will be inclusive and produce fruitful results."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were like this.
Unfortunately, now that this is no longer the tone of many meetings, people have long forgotten the political promise of "kinder, gentler," even though it does not appear to have been practiced.
The Labour Party cannot tolerate the opposite view, and all views are judged on whether or not its leaders accept it. Such momentum is becoming increasingly evident.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy's leadership as a Labour Party, and I had previously believed that I have the same political views with my colleagues, but they are beginning to want me to change this view so that I can stand in positions I will never agree on, whether on national security issues or on the single market of the EU.
Every time I speak in public, what I'm saying doesn't matter - it comes with repeated accusations on social media calling for the cancellation of elections, denouncing centrist politics, or telling me not to join the Labour Party.
Those who have experienced this are not just me.
In fact, I know that I'm lucky compared to some of my colleagues because comments directed at me are often political.
Many of my colleagues face daily charges of flooding, the use of humiliating language of gender discrimination or racist expressions. But they have never shied away and I admire their professionalism and determination.
The most disappointing thing in this political era is that insulting language has become a normality.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church with many voices, and the change of one-on-one "distrust" motion, one-on-one selection rule, makes the Labour Party even narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to persuade me to stay low-key and not be so outspoken that I can "be alone."
But that's not my beginning of politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was a student at school. At that time, due to Thatcher's Government's negligence, our comprehensive classroom had basically been paralyzed and since then, both as legislators and ministers of government, I have made every effort to find better public services for those who most need it.
I never concealed my politics, including in the last general election.
No one in the Northingham East would be surprised at my policy position and areas where I disagree with current leadership.
For those who put forward the bill on Friday, I would like to say that I do not understand that you are wasting time and energy in our country trying to achieve Brexit, harming our families, businesses and public services, arguing whether I am loyal to the Labour leaders.
In fact, I would like to say a word to my constituents (whether they are members of the Labour Party or not), rather than Nottingham Momentum: "I am honored to serve you and I assure you that any threat or political privacy that prevents your election cannot stop me from acting in ways that I feel best fit for all of you."
Chris Leslie is currently a member of the Northingham Eastern District.
Al League 38-17 Likmelros: Unbeatable Al League wins again
The last two attempts may have influenced the final outcome to some extent, but there is no doubt that Ellin deserves to win this jolly race.
They are now the only unbeatable team in 10 teams.
Ultimately, their excellent defense and extraordinary chances were grasped by the team and coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been through the heavy-handed test of the game, but we still have an unbeatable track record so far and I must be happy for that," Merki said.
Robin Christie of Merros said: "Honors belong to Alley, and they have better grasped the opportunity than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute made Alleyn temporarily ahead, then replaced by Frazier Climo, but due to a yellow card against the Warriors Scotsman Rory Hughes led Melros to dominate the numbers, while Jason Baggot grabbed an opportunity not to be replayed.
Before the midfield break, Krimo expanded Ellen's lead with a score of nodule, after hitting the ball, when he gained an extra score alone to change the score to 17-5.
But Melros started well in the second half, and Bargt's pick-up of Patrick Anderson narrowed the score gap to five.
Subsequently, Ruaridh Knott was dragged out for a long time due to serious injuries and after the game restarted, Ellen will again be tensed by a shot at Stafford McDowall in exchange for Krimo.
Subsequently, Ellen's acting captain Blair Macpherson faced a yellow card warning that Melros once again took advantage of the number and broke the huge pressure spell with an unaltered Bruce Colvine shot.
However, after the main team regained momentum, when Stroan Hutchinson was warned by a yellow card because of an outside penalty no-ball crash into Cremo, McFurson scoring his ball touch on the back of El United's attackers.
As with the restart of the game, Krimo was again replaced and after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's kickoff, the fifth attempt by the main team sent back defender Gregory Henry.
Still Game's main stage is preparing to enter the catering industry
Still Game starring Ford Kieran appears to be preparing to enter the hospitality industry, having previously been identified as a director of a registered catering company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the burgeoning BBC television series, which he wrote and co-starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming season 9 will be the final season of the show, and Kieran appears to be planning a life imitating Craigron.
Official records show Kiran is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, despite a Scottish Sun newspaper source hinting that Kiran wanted to join Craigron's "red fire catering."
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia wants the court to decide to reopen the Pacific Path
Sailors inspected the well-equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
On the public building, a sea-blue flag floated.
From Lake Kaka to Amazon's naval base, the caption reads: "The sea is legally ours."
Reclaiming the sea is our duty."
Throughout Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memories of a bloody resource conflict that took place in the 19th century continued to be remembered for falling into Chile's hands. Bolivia was eager to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
This long-standing hope has reached its highest point, as Bolivia finally waited for the ruling of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said: "Bolivia has the power to bring about a positive outcome with its people, harmonious unity and natural cohesion."
The International Court of Justice will stream the entire process of its ruling on all major national screens, which Bolivians can watch throughout. It is hoped that after decades of intermittent negotiations, the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia's claim. Chile has an obligation to negotiate a sovereign sea outlet for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, is a native of the country and will also be concerned about Monday's ruling. Whether the president re-elected in next year's campaign is controversial.
He solemnly declared at the end of August that "we are about to return to the Pacific."
But some analysts argue that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and it will not change anything if such a decision is actually made.
The Netherlands-based United Nations agency is not authorized to grant Chilean territory and has issued regulations that will not determine the possible outcome of negotiations.
Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert, said the final debate had just ended for six months and that the International Court of Justice had ruled, indicating that the case was "uncomplicated".
And the last four years have not propelled Bolivia's goal in any way, on the contrary, it may have regressed.
"The current Bolivian government has blocked access to the Pacific," Zarath said.
She said that Morales' provocative rhetoric drained the remaining goodwill of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to engage in dialogue sooner or later, but after that it is difficult to continue.
Since 1962, the two countries have never exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzer, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, denies this assertion that court decisions are unusually rapid.
Monday's results will "create a great opportunity for Bolivia to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "end reciprocal benefit from differences over 139 years," he said.
For Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, to use maritime issues as a political crutder, Karzadira also denied.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to use the Pacific," he added.
"The ruling will create opportunities for us to overcome past history."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be disarmed without trust in the United States
Foreign Minister Li Yonghao said that if it is not possible to trust the United States, North Korea will never disarm nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Li Yonghao delivered a speech.
He called on the United States to honour the commitments made between the two leaders during the Singapore summit.
Lee's remarks were motivated by the fact that more than three months ago, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to restart a stalled nuclear diplomacy.
Li Yonghao said that if it is to force North Korea to kneel through sustained sanctions and even oppose a declaration of the end of the war, it is simply "white-day dreams."
If Pyongyang fails to take major disarmament action first, Washington will be cautious about agreeing to a declaration.
Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump both hope to hold the summit again.
But there is widespread doubt that North Korea will actually give up its nuclear arsenal, after all, it is highly likely to see it as the only way to safeguard its security.
Pompeo plans to visit North Korea next month and negotiate another Korean-US summit.
Paris fashion shows bring many of the latest series of headwear
If you're hesitant to buy a few more hats or hide the sun, don't hesitate anymore.
Designers of Valentino and Tom Browne, at the showroom in Paris Fashion Week, launched an oddly super large SS19 series.
This summer, extremely unusable hats swept Instagram and so the designers brought their own design's eye-catching hats to T.
Valentino's most striking single piece is a rice overcap, decorated with feathery wide side, completely covering the models' heads.
Other super large-sized accessories include jeweled watermelon caps, wizard caps, and even pineapple caps, but these designs are not intended for warmth.
On the eve of Halloween, Thom Browne launched a series of strange masks.
Many colorful masks, with their own lips, are more like Hannibal Lecter than advanced fashion.
Some are similar to scuba diving equipment, also equipped with breathing tubes and eyewitnesses, while others are like a melting ice cream vial.
On the way to continue searching for fashionable verbs, you will also have a more surprising discovery.
Fashion Observers predict that a huge hat might be on your side of the fashion street.
Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski on the top of the "La Bomba" herb hat is very eye-catching, overstated, with a width of 2 feet, can be imagined, then will become hot and popular decoration.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat splashed on social media sends another important creation to the platform - a straw sandbag nearly as big as a model wearing swimwear. This utility hat is widely advertised on social media, and the fashion label behind it puts another great creative onto T-a straw sandbag almost as big as a model wearing swimsuits.
This coarse orange Lafi straw bag, decorated with a white leather handle on the side of it, is an eyepoint in the Paris Fashion Week's Jacquemus'La Riviera SS19 series.
Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "It is estimated that next summer there will be a variety of big hats and sandpacks in the fashion street, because designers have made huge impact on the demand for super large accessories can not be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills are critical to global citizens
Scotland's private schools have maintained an excellent track record of academic performance, as in 2018, with a series of delightful test scores and personal and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community work.
The private schools are home to more than 30,000 students across Scotland and under the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS), which strives to provide the highest quality of service for their students and parents.
The purpose of private schools is to lay a good foundation for students' continuing education and higher education, career choices, and social status as global citizens.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customised school curricula, we are privileged to witness that modern language has always been a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to one another in a language that others can understand, your words will enter the other's brain."
If you speak to each other's mother tongue, your words will enter the heart of one another."
It reminds us that when we want to build relationships and trust with foreign friends, we can't rely solely on English.
From the latest results of this year's exams, private schools have a strong language pass rate.
Sixty-eight percent of students studying foreign languages achieved grade A.
Data from 74 member schools of the Scottish Committee on Private Schools (SCIS) show that 72% of Chinese students have achieved grade A, while 72% of those who study German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those who learn Spanish also achieve grade A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, as a subject, in private school curricula and elsewhere, language and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are treated equally.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employees' efforts to fill vacancies were due to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in order to lay a good foundation for the post-childhood career of teenagers.
As more jobs in the future will require language, this skill becomes critical in today's globalized world.
Whatever your chosen career, if you learn the second language and master this life-long skill, the future will certainly have a real advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign friends will certainly make people who have many languages high in competition.
A 2013 survey of more than 4,000 UK adults showed that 75% of people were able to speak foreign languages well and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage (15%).
Therefore, it is essential to increase investment in language education for today's children.
Mastering multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will provide better opportunities for children to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the languages taught in each school are different.
Many schools focus on teaching more classic modern languages, while others teach those languages that they believe will be very important to the UK in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter which language your child is interested in, private schools offer multilingual options and are equipped with professional teaching staff in the field.
Regardless of the future of children, private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a good learning environment where they can lay a solid foundation and provide them with the skills necessary for success.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, language remains critical to the future of countries and must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should truly be seen as "international communication skills".
Scotland's private schools will continue to provide youth with such choices, diversity and excellence.
This must be done.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Committee on Private Schools (SCIS)
LeBron will host the Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans are about to wait for LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in Sunday's pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet clear whether James will play.
Watton said on the Lakers' official website that "the length of time will be between 1 minutes and 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James's playing time might be limited.
After training ended earlier this week, James was asked about planning for the Lakers six pre-season schedules.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer needed a pre-season to warm up," he said.
Trump's West Virginia rally time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of campaign rallies in Wellington, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five rallies that Trump plans to hold next week, including staying in some friendly places like Tennessee and West Side.
Because the choice to fill a vacant seat in the Supreme Court has led to a pause of voting, Trump's move is aimed at garnering support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face risk of losing control over Congress during their November ballot.
Time for the Trump West Virginia rally tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wellington, West Virginia is scheduled to take place on September 29, 2018, at 7:00 East Time tonight.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via the live-stream channel on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearing on the issue of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which led to tensions over allegations of sexual misconduct during an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
However, the main purpose of these rallies is to help Republicans who are about to face November's general election win some support.
The five rallies next week were designed to "motivate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and House of Representatives."
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters that "the control of Congress is critical to its agenda and so as the busy season comes, the president will travel to as many states as possible."
According to the West Virginia City Times, "A rally planned for this evening at Wesbanco Arena will bring together a large number of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will attract a lot of Pittsburgh media."
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, and in 2016 he won with more than 40 percent of the state.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Republican Senate candidate who lags behind in the poll.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scholar at the University of West Virginia, said: "The president has had to push him up in polls, which is not a good sign for Morrissey."
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team demonstrated a tenacious competitive spirit in Sunday's singles race
After the first three singles, a four-man one on Saturday afternoon could be exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
Motivation swing is a brand-new concept invented by the sporting world, and sportsmen have no doubt about it, especially in such competitions.
Now, where is the momentum?
"They were six points ahead and now four, so I think we have some momentum right now," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, the European team has a certain advantage, currently leading 4 points, and there are still 12 points in the next game.
As Spies puts it, the U.S. team felt somewhat unlucky but a lot of things were encouraging, especially with Spies and Justin Thomas who played all day in three out of four respectively.
Spies was extremely lethal from the pitcher to the greens, hitting a benchmarking level.
As the game goes on, screaming and cheering swells up and down, with him and Thomas losing 2 to 2, his key pusher's record of finishing fourth.
His tug wins for the U.S. team, and shouting again on the field makes us see that they believe the U.S. team hasn't gone out.
"You really need to go deep into your heartbeat."
That's what all the players are currently in.
18 holes to hit the ballpoint.
Over the past two days, scoring more than Spies and Thomas's players, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, were undisputed matches of the Ryder Cup.
The European team's odd but unbeatable combination, four wins without losing the ball and they won't make mistakes.
"Moliwood is the only group of partners who didn't hit bacon on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bacon on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and after nine runs on Friday mornings.
This flow of energy to the raucous crowd and how it flows out, further illustrates what they're going to beat on Sunday and no more popular players will be able to win Europe.
It is best to be in different caves at the same time.
But it's too early to talk about winning the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly figured out the morning four-player hero Sergio Garcia, who was partnered with Alex Noren.
A peacock and two of the first nine "doubles" punched the Spaniard and this Swedish player into a hole that could never be climbed out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the hole.
The four-man, four-man and one-man matches are particularly attractive for close viewing because the match between partners, recommendations from each other, reminders of each other, and strategies can change instantly.
So far, the European team has performed better and made a clear lead on the last day, but the four-one game also shows that people, especially those in the United States, are untrue about what they suspect.
Europe's 10-6 lead to the Ryder Cup final
After a 10-6 victory over the U.S. team in Saturday's four-man, four-man and two-man races, European teams will enter the Ryder Cup final with an absolute advantage.
Intuitive duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari scored two victories in a match against Tiger Woods, increasing the points that have so far earned at Le Golf National in France to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team tried to recapture the trophy that had been lost in Hezetin two years ago, defeating a failed U.S. team in an early morning four-man and four-round game with 3-1 wins.
The U.S. team resisted heavily in four-man and two matches, winning two games, but never able to compensate for the backwards situation.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points to defend the trophy in Sunday's 12 singles.
Fritwood was the first European rookie to score four, and he and Morrisnaly were called "Morriwood" after this sensational weekend, who were the second team in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four-Man four games, they matched with great acquiescence, which ultimately defeated the disheartened Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau at a 5-4 victory.
Woods, who was reluctant to finish two matches on Saturday, had occasionally flashed light, but now he has lost 19 in 29 four-man and four-man games, including seven.
Justin Rose, who didn't play four or four games in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson for four or two matches, 2-1 defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - both ranked first in the world and third in the world respectively.
Although a relaxing and enjoyable day can be spent in the southwestern part of Paris, the European team did not do what it wanted.
Three-time Grand Slam winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas laid a good foundation on Saturday in two-division U.S. teams.
They fought 2-1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-man round, after returning to beat Bort and Rory McIlroy with 4-3 at the four-man round, despite losing two holes in the opening.
Only two behind four teams in the history of the Ryder Cup were able to enter a single game, although the host Forricks can defend the trophy with only a draw.
However, as it ranks second in the first two days of the game, it appears to be rebounded in Sunday's backlash.
North Korea says lack of sufficient trust is "never possible" to unilaterally disarm
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that ongoing sanctions deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States, in which case it would never be possible to unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said in a statement to the World Organization's annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "a lot of friendly initiatives" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing nuclear testing sites, and guaranteeing no proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any response from the U.S. side," Li said.
"As long as we remain untrustful of the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in this case we will not be a unilaterally disarmed 'beggar'."
While Li reiterated North Korea's consistent complaints about Washington's resistance to "step-by-step" denuclearization (in which case it would be rewarded by progressive measures), the focus of his statement seemed to be that North Korea did not refuse to renounce unilateral denuclearization like Pyongyang in the past.
Lee referred to a joint statement issued on June 12 by current U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at his first meeting in Singapore, during which Kim Jong-un pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee security for North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and exerts pressure through sanctions to achieve its objectives by means of coercion, even against declaring the end of the war."
"Considering that sanctions can only make us succumb to a daydream of those who don't know anything about us."
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust of the United States."
Li did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, which was highlighted earlier this week by U.S. leaders at the United Nations.
The foreign minister insisted that Kim had held three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If one of the issues of denuclearization is South Korea rather than the United States, then the issue of denuclearization on the Korean peninsula will not be in such a stalemate."
Even so, after "Evil President" Trump called Kim Jong Un a "rocket customer" carrying out suicide missions, Lee told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's artillery fire would inevitably target the U.S. mainland, but Li's rhetoric was quite different from last year.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, greatly applauded the courage of Kim Jong Un for his disarmament measures this year at the United Nations, but he said there was still much work to be done and sanctions must continue before North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timeframe for this, saying that "even if it takes two, three or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang's measures.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Wednesday: "It is imperative to continue vigorously implementing the sanctions imposed by the Council until we achieve final and fully verifiable denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Council has agreed to strengthen sanctions against North Korea in order to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Li Yonghao on the side of the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unlucky.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that if North Korea did not denounce him for a few hours with "the same demands of bandits," the trip made some progress.
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that if the United States took "appropriate measures", then we would dismantle missile launchers and nuclear complexes.
Lee said Kim Jong-un told him that the "corresponding measure" he was seeking was Trump's security assurances in Singapore, as well as progress toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to learn how to get enough rest time
This year, Harvard opened a new course that gave all undergraduates more sleep to resist the growing male culture of staying up late with caffeine.
One scholar found that the world's No. 1 university, when talking about how to take care of their basic problems, students tend to be clueless.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Briggham and Women's Hospital, who believes it is the first such program in the United States.
After a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he was inspired to start studying the course.
"After the speech, a girl approached me and asked me, 'Why did I get to four years old before I learned this?'
She said no one told me how important her sleep was, which surprised me," he introduced to The Telegraph.
The course, first introduced this year, mainly explains how good sleep habits can contribute to academic and athletic performance as well as improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Department of Health Services, said that after finding students with severe sleep deprivation, Harvard decided to launch the course this week.
An hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one course, a dormitory picture was shown showing students knocking on coffee cups, curtains, training textbooks and books listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on exercise performance, and the importance of pre-sleep activities.
In another course, students learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
In the classroom, a campus map was hung with interactive icons that encouraged students to think about their daily activities.
"We know that this doesn't immediately change the behavior of students."
"But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know that smoking is harmful to health," added Professor Czeisler.
He said there is also a phenomenon that prides itself on "all-out" and added that the increasing pressure of modern technology and students all means sleep deprivation will become an increasingly serious problem.
He said ensuring adequate sleep and good quality of sleep should be a "secret weapon" for students to cope with stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain because undersleeping can put the brain into starvation patterns that make people feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who specializes in chemistry and physical biology, was his first year at Harvard University when he attended a class by Professor Czeisler to help professors design the course.
He said the course opens his eyes and inspires him to make a full effort to build a campus curriculum.
Next, his hope is that all graduate students will complete a similar course of study before joining the competition agency.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting an alarm clock to bed and wake up, paying attention to the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting devices, as this can lead to a person's circadian rhythm out of control resulting in difficulty sleeping.
Levinston 1-0 Winning the Rangers: Monga's goal forced Gerard to fall behind
Due to Dolly Menga's goal, Steven Gerrard's fragmented team was defeated by 1-0 Winston and the rovers were lost.
Ebrox wanted to record his first 4-1 victory over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered a second loss since Gerard coached for 18 games, leaving his team behind eight points in the match with Libo Super League leader Harts.
Monga scored 7 minutes before the end of the first half, and the roaming squad lacked momentum that seemed difficult to defeat.
Now the rovers are down to sixth place, while Livingston rises to third, with net score only lag behind Hebron.
The objects that were thrown at the end of the match resulted in a head injury to the border referee Calum Spence, which could lead to subsequent troubles for the wanderers.
Gerard changed eight times, sweeping Alley into the Scottish League Cup (Betfred Cup) semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt also opted for the 11 Liverpool players who took a stake in Harts last week, and if these well-trained teams were able to suppress opponents at each round, he would be satisfied.
The Rangers may have taken the initiative, but Livingston's performance was unusually prominent in controlling the ball.
They should have scored in two minutes, and for the first time Monga passed the goal to Scott Pittman over Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a great opportunity.
Subsequently, a deep arbitrage ball by Keaghan Jacobs passed the ball to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was on the back.
The Rangers did control the situation, but for a third of the finals they seemed to have more hope than belief.
When the game came to a quarter of an hour, Alfredo Morelos collided with Steven Lawless, who thought he would get a penalty, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's claim.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half of the game, but former Ebrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubling by Lasana Coulibaly's headset and Ovie Ejaria's round-the-clock shot.
While Livingston's 34-minute opening may be unfavorable to the pace of the game, no one has denied that their toughness deserves this result.
The wanderers once again plunged into Jacobs' carefully crafted defensive streak.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not react and Afield calmly judged that Monga would complete a simple shot.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent with Cullipali during his midfield break, which almost immediately produced a result and the position of the striker Morelos created a vacancy, but an impressive Kelly punched off its defensive line.
However, Livingston continues to attract fans' eyes in the way they enjoy, with Lisgo and Harcott performing a long pass after another.
Holt's team would have been able to pull the lead in the final stage, but before Lithgo broke his head from the corner, McGregor well overtook Jacobs' offensive.
Glenn Middleton, a rogue replacement team member, applied for a penalty once again after an argument with Jacobs, but Thomson glanced away again.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
Next is the Sunday Morning News Yearbook: September 30, 1882, or today 136 years ago, it's exactly the day when physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually evolved into a device called the "Geg Counter".
Since then, Geiger counters have become the backbone of popular culture, as in the 1950 movie The Colorado Clock, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play the lines that seem unlikely to be scientists:
Man: "What's the point of this?"
Rogers: "This is a geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
After wearing headphones, you can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactive action in minerals."
Evans: "Have to shrink, it will certainly be especially popular!"
'Hans' Geiger died on his 63rd birthday in 1945.
But this invention, named after him, will remain immortal.
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to "discover" invalid cells
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to "discover" albinoid cells and kill them
Vaccine trainings the immune system to identify albinoid cells, thus being used for treatment
This method requires the extraction of immune cells from the patient's body and then changes them in the laboratory.
In this way, one protein that is common in a variety of cancers can be "discovered" and then re-injected into the body.
One test vaccine has been successful in a variety of cancer patients.
After using the vaccine to train the immune system to recognize ungrateful cells for a woman's treatment, her ovarian cancer has gone away for 18 months.
This method requires the extraction of immune cells from the patient's body and then changes them in the laboratory so that they can "discover" a protein called HER2, which is common to many cancers, and then re-inject it into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we are about to arrive at a very promising vaccine."
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 "is a factor contributing to the development of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer."
The immune cells are extracted from the patient's body and then "trained" them to locate cancer cells, using a similar approach that has been initially effective in treatment with leukemia.
Kanye West, who had previously been wearing a MAGA hat for SNL, was faced with insults sparked by his support for Trump.
The result is not so good.
In the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West suffered a booze in a disorganized speech that publicly praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he should be involved in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, with a hat "Make America Great" that night, he began to speak out about the Republican Party and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Many times I spoke to white people and they said, 'How do you like Trump, his racial discrimination?'
"So if I'm worried about racial discrimination, I wouldn't have moved out of the United States a long time ago," West said.
SNL starts with a funny short play starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was unreleased, Wester's roaring footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is difficult to determine whether Locke's release of the video was intended to ridicule West.
At the same time, Vister complained to the audience that he had spent a difficult time in the backseat wearing his hat.
According to the Washington Observer, he said: "They're bullying me in the back.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They bully me!
Then they said I was in trouble."
He continued, "Do you want to know what is the dilemma?" and said he would "wear my superhuman cloak because that means you won't be able to command me how to do it." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
According to Variety, at least twice his review sparked a booze from the audience, and SNL performers seemed embarrassed, one of whom told reporters: "The entire studio was in mortal silence."
Vetst was invited as the latest recruiter for singer Ariane Grande, Grant's former boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
Viester dressed as Perrier Bottle, singing the song "I Love It," a move that puzzles many people.
With the support of conservative organization TPUSA head Candace Turner, Turner wrote on Twitter: "Pay tribute to the most fearless: thank you for your brave fight against the mob."
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that Wester was just "daring to be yourself, it's pretty amazing."
"But I won't reward (buying his music, clothing or supporting his 'arts') those who I think are accepting and spreading ideologies that are harmful to my community."
He is free.
"We're also," Hunter added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed he was now "officially a Kanye West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name before Diddy (also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy) changed his name.
Snoop Dogg, a rapper who used to be called Snoop Lion and of course the late musical talent Prince, changed his name into a symbol before he was known as Prince.
In a restaurant in Belfast, there were intentional knife-killing killings.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington lashed out on "toxic" manhood
Kit Harington plays Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama series Game of Thrones, and is known to the public as a swordsman.
Kit, 31, has been fiercely attacked by the stereotype of his - hard-fashioned hero - phenomenon, he said, such characters on screen meant that young people always felt that they had to behave cold enough to be respected.
Kit said in the Sunday Times cultural column that he believed there were "problems" and threw out a question about how to solve this "toxic" male temperament of the #MeToo personality age.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, a star co-star in Game of Thrones (at the same age).Kit admits he has a "very strong" feeling that needs to be addressed.
"At this moment, I personally have a very strong feeling that where is the problem with our masculinity?" he said.
"From the question we now recognize, what have we been teaching them as children grow up?"
Kit believes that the "toxic" male temperament is so prevalent that televisions may be primarily responsible because of their very masculine personality.
He went on to say, "What are born and what are learning from the next day?"
What is being shown on television and in the street, so that these young people feel they do not have to behave like this, only to be considered a man?
I think this is indeed the most serious problem of our time, and how should we change that?
Because there are obvious problems with young people.
He also admitted in the interview that this season's Game of Thrones will kill Qing next summer, after which he will no longer play any prelude or sequel, calling himself "tired from the battlefield and the horse."
Starting in November, Kit will star at Sam Shepard's True West remake of a story between a filmmaker and his brother as a robber.
Kit recently revealed that he felt the happiest thing to play Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in this TV show and therefore gave me the family after, as well as life now," he said.
In Game of Thrones, Rose plays Kit's lover Ygritte as Jon Snow. The Game of Thrones has won the Emmy Award for Best Drama Series.
In June 2018, the couple held a wedding at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: China's new HIV cases increase by 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV.
China's CDC reports that there are more than 820,000 people living with HIV in China.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 additional patients were reported.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted through sexual activity, which can be described as a historic change.
In the past, the main means of rapid transmission of HIV in some parts of China have been the transmission of blood infections.
At a meeting in Yunnan Province, China's National Observatory for Human Security said that the number of people infected with HIV by this means would almost be zero.
At the same time, however, HIV-infected people in China have increased by 100,000 compared to last year.
For the LGBT population in China, sexually transmitted HIV has become a serious problem.
In 1997, China legalized homosexuality, but discrimination against the LGBT population remained widespread.
China's values are relatively conservative, with a study estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The spread of many diseases stems from the lack of neutralized protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed itself to universalizing AIDS drugs and addressing this issue.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information from Republican senators, sparking "dangerous lies" and "conspiracies."
On Saturday, Rep. Maxine Waters denounced the House of Representatives' statement that three Republican U.S. senators had personal information published on a Wikipedia page for MPs.
Maxine Waters, a Los Angeles Democrat, said the claim drew criticism from "right-wing" experts and websites.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that "liars, lies, and all are deceitful lies."
Reportedly, the published information included home addresses and phone numbers for South Carolina U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was released from Capitol Hill to the Internet on Thursday, with an unnamed person attending a Senate panel hearing in response to allegations of sexual misconduct by candidate Brett Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court.
The information leaked some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, reports from conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have determined that the IP address of the information-sharing device is related to Waters' offices and published information about one of Waters' employees.
Waters continued: "This statement is simply non-true, total falsehood, absolute lie."
"My staff is absolutely not the person who leaked this information, a statement that was liars but undermined their identity, personal information and security."
This is a blunder of falsehood, an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon drew criticism from netizens, including former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer writes: "Her words of denial are full of anger."
"This shows that her temper is not suitable for being a congressman.
In the case of accusations against others and their own wrongdoing, the most necessary is anger.
There is no one in sight.
The motives of the accuser should not be questioned.
"You have to be calm."
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' reaction with Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whose performance at the Thursday hearing seemed too angered by critics.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said on Twitter, "If that's the case, you don't need to be so exaggerated."
Waters said in a statement that her office has reminded "the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned that these claims are fraudulent."
She continued: "We want to ensure that the culprits are found and they are legally responsible for what they do, which have a devastating impact on me and my employees."
"Bean Agent 3 East Mountain Rise" Review: Rovin Eaginson Reinvents Funny Spies Image
The same is true of the English action comedy series, Bean Agents. The first Bean Agent was released in 2003 and the second in 2011.
This joking irony has no new export opportunities, and it's ironic how worthless we are?
Anyway, Johnny Ingles, an eye-opening and impenetrable man, once again got permission to mess things up. His name is more expressive, which illustrates the creation of this well-known comedian, targeting non-English viewers.
Despite his extraordinary desire to dress up as an elegant gentleman and charm, he can't get rid of the stupid secret agent image, let people see Kruso, beans, and the lad who played the theme song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Initially, he was a tourist and international mystery man in Barclays TV ads, Egginson, who always made a bunch of messes, although those ads had been forgotten behind the scenes.
In this "Bean Agent" in England there is one or two highlights out there.
I like Johnny England wearing medieval armour near helicopters when the spin blades hit him on his helmet, sending a tick.
Eakinson's action comedy talent is obvious, but the sense of humor is quite inadequate, strange and very troubling, especially such as "serious" movie brands like 007 and spying, now confidently integrated into the comedic composition.
This sense of humor is more like a child than an adult. I personally feel that, compared to the jokes made by Ekinson's beans in silent films, Johnny Inglesia has been lacking in creativity and cohesion.
Today's theme is the melodies that focus on Britain in a serious dilemma.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the UK's super secret spy network and exposed the identities of all British agents, which crippled the crew - a small role played by Kevin Eldon.
The prime minister's role in the film is hypnotic, problematic and politically unpopular: Emma Thompson did his best to show Teresa May's character from the outside, but there was no line.
Her intelligence advisers told her that all active spies were exposed to identity and could only find a person from retired agents to take charge.
The only option is the clumsy Johnny Ingles, who has now changed his career as headmaster at a luxury institution but teaches privately how to become a undercover agent: this baggage is novel because England opens a rock-campus espionage college.
Ingles was quickly brought back to the Whitehall, attended an emergency conference and reunited with his old friend Bough (played again by Ben Miller).
Bowf is now home, a bit wasted on Vicki Pepperdine. Boeff is now a married man and his wife is a submarine commander whose role has been garnered some publicity by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who made a big mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, came back to meet Ophelia Bulletova, the snake scorpion beauty portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the British prime minister is in trouble demeaned by Jason Volta, a sinister character portrayed by an extraordinary tech billionaire named Jake Lacy.
Ingles and Bowf began their funny carnival journey: they disguised themselves as waiters, setting fire to a blond French restaurant; creating chaos of suicide on Volta's luxury yachts; and in using virtual reality headphones familiar with the interior of the Volta home, England sparked pure anarchy.
All the suspense in the end was relieved at once, so harmonious, so lively, but as a whole, it remained only at the level of low- and young children's drama.
Overall evaluations are uneven.
Like two other "Bean Agents" films, I can't help but delve into thinking: Can the British film industry not give Rovin Egginson a worthy role?
Labor Party denies that it hasn't set up a plan to keep the British wages unchanged from "the top four-three"
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider implementing a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week, but paychecks are unchanged.
Labour reportedly hopes businesses will use the expense saved by artificial intelligence (AI) to provide workers with more days of rest.
In this way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend for a week while the salary to bring home remains unchanged.
The source said the idea was "consistent" with Labour's economic agenda and plans would tilt toward British workers.
The four-day work day plan was supported by the British Union of Trade Unions (TUC) so that workers could benefit from economic transformation.
A senior Labour source said Sunday Times: "The results of the policy review are expected to be published by the end of the year.
"This cannot be done once in a while, but the 'first four-three' working system is in line with the Labour Party's goal of leaning toward workers' interests as well as its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to support this idea, and during the 2017 election, Greens pledged to launch a "top four-three" working system.
However, the plan has not yet been supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
One Labour finder said: "The working system of the 'Top Four and Three' is not a political party policy, which Labor Party has not yet considered."
Shadow Secretary John McDonnell, at last week's Labor Party meeting, articulated his views on the socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "undistinguished directors" and "rapists" in utility companies.
McDonnell's plan at the same time meant that existing shareholders of water companies might not be able to recover all their shares, as the Labour government could "deduct" them on an unethical basis.
He also confirmed plans to support workers as board members of the company, creating an "inclusive ownership fund" that will give employees 10% of private equity so they can take up to PS500 in annual dividends.
Lynsey Graham and John Kennedy in the 60-Minute Show Explained Whether The FBI's Investigation into Kavanaugh Could Affect Their Decision
FBI investigations into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh forced a final vote to be postponed for at least a week, while making people begin to wonder whether the FBI's findings would shake Republican senators' support for Bret Kavanaugh.
In a Sunday interview on 60 Minutes, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican lawmakers John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about the FBI's findings that would not affect their decisions.
Kennedy was more open than Graham's (from South Carolina) idea.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing and I said I've talked to Kavanaugh.
After the incident, after the charges were released, I called and asked him, 'Have you done it?'
He was decisive, firm and clear."
However, Graham's vote seems to have been nailed on the board.
"I've come up with a good idea for Bret Kavanaugh's vote, and I won't change my mind even on the charges of poisoning and firefighting," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what the truth really is, but I understand that Brett insists he hasn't done it," Graham added. Dr. Ford in his speech refers to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone she said couldn't verify if what she said was true.
It's 36 years old.
"Nothing has changed."
What is a global civic music festival and what has it contributed to poverty alleviation?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizenship Music Festival, an annual music festival with a very impressive star performance lineup and equally impressive mission: eradicating world poverty.
This year, the 17th Global Civic Music Festival will attract thousands of people into the lawns of Central Park to raise awareness about the real purpose of this event - eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 while admiring performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes.
The 2012 Global Civic Music Festival is an extension of the global poverty alleviation project, which is an international advocacy organization designed to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight poverty.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), viewers must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling or helping raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty in any other meaningful way.
But it's only 12 years away from achieving the goal, and will Global Citizen succeed?
Is it possible to convince people to act as rewards with a free concert, or just another statement of what is called "online click activism" (people feel like they really do something by signing online petitions or sending tweets)?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has documented more than 19 million "actions" from supporters to achieve a wide range of different goals.
Global Citizen said the actions have helped promote world leaders to issue commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the organization recognized 390 commitments and announcements in its operations, of which at least $10 billion had been paid or raised.
The organization expects funding to have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of these key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between British investors and implementers committed to "helping children achieve their full potential for growth," and after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world, committing $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in the country.
At a concert in London in April 2018, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition Tacey Ullman said: "With the support of the British government, donors, governments and many global citizens like you, undernourished social injustice is about to become a historical footnote."
The organization also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the British government to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the Power of Nutrition project, which will take nutritional interventions against 5 million women and children.
In response to a common question on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we even fall and fail."
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because our unity will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will serve as guest performers for the festival's event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Interior Minister said the U.S. will launch a naval "blocking" to stop Russia's energy exports
According to the Washington Observer newspaper, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that "if necessary" Washington could move naval forces to stop Russian energy shocks in markets including the Middle East.
Zinkai claims that Russia's activities in Syria - especially those at the invitation of its legitimate government - are a prelude to exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the Russian side has intervened in the Middle East because they want to repeat their actions in Eastern Europe and act as an energy agent for the southern suburbs of Europe."
Officially, there are many ways and means to address this issue.
"The United States is capable of working with our navy to ensure the smoothness of maritime routes and, if necessary, can block Russia's energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinkai spoke at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that calls itself "the spokesman for energy consumers" in the United States.
He contrasted Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that the two were actually the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic choices are more or less used and alternative fuels," he said, adding that Russia is a "black horse" economically dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration has been working to boost LNG exports to Europe, replacing Russia's position that is cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "untimely" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that, according to Trump, would make Berlin a "monopoly market" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is just a purely economic project aimed at doubling existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's strong opposition to the project was purely economic, and it was unfairly competitive.
In September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow, "I believe we all acknowledge that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and consumers should have the right to choose suppliers."
The US side's position has been strongly opposed by Germany, which has reiterated its intention to join the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: "If third countries interfere with our energy supply, we will face great trouble."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she would "gravely consider" the 2020 presidential election
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "gravely consider" the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During her inauguration at Holly York City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider being elected.
According to the Capitol Hill newspaper, Warren said: "It's time for women to go to Washington politics and we have a fragmented government that needs one upper-ranking woman."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential election."
Speaking of President Donald Trump during his inauguration at the Town Hall, Warren said: "He's bringing our country to the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about the steps Donald Trump has taken toward democracy," Warren said.
Warren is outspoken in his accusations against Trump and his nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: "Of course, before voting we need the FBI to investigate."
However, poll results released on Thursday show that Warren's own majority of voters think she shouldn't be involved in the 2020 election.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said senators should not be elected.
32% of voters support their candidacy.
Polls show that the majority of voters supported former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% supporting him and 48% opposing him.
Other high-profile Democrats likely to participate in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said that it would formally decide whether to vote in January.
Sarah Palin reprimands Track Palin with post-traumatic stress disorder at presidential rally
Track Palin, 26, was enlisted in September and then spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"The feelings of my son, the feelings he experienced after his return, believe that other soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or injured family members can get along," she said at a rally with audiences in Tarsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the elephant in the room (which is obvious and neglected)" and said that her son and other veterans "have changed after they come back, and they want to know whether he or she has been equally respected as a soldier, pilot and himself as all of the other members of the army."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, accused of committing domestic violence and carrying weapons against a woman after being drunk.
The U.S. Challenges New Asylum Policy, 18 States and the District of Columbia
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported legal challenges to a new policy that refused to provide shelter for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a friend-of-court briefing to Washington on Friday in support of a asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The lawsuit against federal policy filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union - Grace v. Sessions - has not yet disclosed the full name of the plaintiff.
Grace said she was abused by her partner "and his son of a violent gang member," but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers in support of Grace said that countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are facing widespread gangs and domestic violence, resulting in a large number of people applying for U.S. asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignored state, federal and international laws for decades."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be ruled based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, a ban that violates these principles," the Friends of the Tribunal brief said.
In the briefing, lawyers further argued that the policy of denying immigration undermines the U.S. economy, which is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor force."
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum for victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
In announcing the policy on June 11, Sessions said that "those who are persecuted or feared by race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political opinion and then leave their country can be granted asylum."
Asylum is never intended to alleviate all the problems that people around the world face every day, even if they are serious.
With the death toll doubling, Barru's desperate rescuers squander in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It feels very nervous," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is calming her son of the fever in a badly damaged evacuation center in Barru.
"The ambulance brings the body every minute.
"Clean drinking water is scarce."
The residents returned to their destroyed homes, carefully searching for water immersed items and trying to rescue anything they could find.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake injured hundreds of people, and the hospital was destroyed and flooded.
Some wounded people, including Dwi Haris, who was injured on his back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients had to be treated outdoors due to intense aftershocks.
Reminiscent of the intense tremor that occurred in the fifth floor room of the hotel, which lived with his wife and daughter, Harris' eyes were full of tears.
"We don't have time for self-help at all.
I think I've been squeezed into the ruins of the wall," Harris told AP reporters, adding that their entire family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for life, but then there was no voice.
I don't know how my wife and kids are.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador to China accused of "bullying" in Chinese 'political propaganda advertising'
A week ago, a Chinese official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily to boast of the mutual benefit of trade between China and the United States, accusing Beijing of using American media for political propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the Chinese Daily published a pay supplement in The Demein Chronicle, Iowa's largest-selling newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere with the November 6 congressional elections, after which it denied the allegations.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, marking a new stage in what U.S. officials said to Reuters as Washington's pressure on China escalates.
While advertising by foreign governments to promote trade is commonplace, Beijing and Washington are now mired in an escalating trade war with the two sides imposing several rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts said that in the early days of the trade war, China's retaliatory tariffs were aimed at cracking down on exporters from Republican states such as Iowa who supported Trump.
Terry Branstad, a former long-time governor of Iowa and major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing's actions hurt workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
In a commentary article published on Sunday in the Demein Chronicle, Brantard wrote that China "is intensifying bullying by publishing political propaganda advertisements in our own free media."
"In terms of political propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of freedom of expression and press to publish paid advertisements in the Demein Chronicle," Blanstad wrote.
"By contrast, you rarely see the voices of opposition at books and newspapers in Beijing's streets or real reflections of Chinese people's dissent over China's worrisome economic trajectory because the media is under strict supervision by the Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "China's most famous newspapers even refused to publish his articles," but he did not specify which one.
Analysts warn that the Republican party's divorced female voters before the mid-term will lead to Kavanaugh's defeat.
For Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, several Republican leaders insisted on supporting and defending him, analysts warned that in the upcoming midterm elections they would face strong opposition, especially from women.
The sentiment sparked by the incident was very high, and most registered Republicans have shown that they want to get a vote.
In an article published on Saturday, Professor Grant Reeher of the University of Cheshire's Maxwell College revealed to The Capitol Hill newspaper that "these things cannot have a backtrack."
Ryle said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republicans) had struggled to fight for the FBI's investigation at an emergency juncture would be enough to calm voters' fury.
Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesman for Progressive MoveOn, said on Friday: "Women will never forget what happened in the past - they can't forget tomorrow, but not throughout November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans in control of the Judiciary opted to continue supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, leading to a similar rally on Friday morning along the Senate corridor with protesters chanting "November is coming!"
A nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website that "the enthusiasm and enthusiasm for democracy are about to overrun."
"People say the enthusiasm has been very high; it's right.
But enthusiasm is even higher, especially for women and young voters in the suburban areas (18-29 years old), who usually won't vote when they don't like the president."
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts warned that if Republicans continue to push for a vote, there would be strong opposition.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele said: "This will bring chaos to the GOP."
Guy Cecil, head of Priority USA, an organization that helped elect Democrats, told the news channel: "It's not just about the committee's vote or final result, or whether Kavanaugh will be placed in a replacement seat, it's also about how Republicans tackle this issue and how they treat victims."
However, with Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony echoing, the American people seem to have some disagreement over who should be believed, slightly leaning toward the latter.
The latest poll by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were clear or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were clear or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of the respondents said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony might or must have been lying, while only 30% indicated that they believed Ford's testimony could or must have been lying.
According to the Guardian, at Frack's bid, the FBI is currently investigating charges against Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee to prove that Kavanaugh raped her after being drunk at age 17.
Lamirez accused Supreme Court candidates of nudging her genitalia at a party during their attendance at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventors Plan to Build New Internet Compete With Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup trying to match Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The legendary latest project in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to "rule the world."
Speaking of the startup, he said: "We have to act right away."
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do items, calendars, symposiums and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, it can be used on the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which type of information can be accessed.
The company calls this feature "Personal Empowerment through Data."
According to CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's intention is to help the company introduce resources, processes and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a secure platform acquired by IBM, some dedicated developers working on the project and a community of programmers volunteering.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will use tools available on Inrupt's website to create their own decentralized applications.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change in the face of their entire business model being completely disrupted overnight.
"We are not getting their permission."
In a sticker posted on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems so as to help protect the quality and integrity of Solid-based new networks.
In 1994, Berners-Lee established the World Wide Web Alliance at MIT to change the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become a strong force in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continued to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next-generation network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Remembrance of First World War Victoria Cross Winners
During World War I, the only clergyman of the British National Church who fought and won the Victorian Cross held a celebration in his hometown 100 years later.
Reverend Lieutenant Bernard Vann was awarded a medal in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Unfortunately, four days later he was killed by a sniper, so no one knew that he had won the highest military honor in Britain.
On Saturday, during a team parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren opened the monument.
His grandson Michael Vann said the monument was a "splendour of glory", honoring his grandfather for 100 years.
According to the London Bulletin, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led the army through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a thick fog in the rains of field artillery and machine guns."
Then he rushed toward the front line, "validly" led forward fighters to strike and then shot down three small detachments with a hand-held field gun.
On October 4, 1918, more than a month before the war ended, Colt Vann was shot dead by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Vann commented on his grandfather's behavior as, "I know that my grandfather's heroism will never surpass me, but it will keep me humble."
After the march, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann donated a wreath.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to take part in the march," adding that "a true hero can see how valiant it is from the support of all."
The show Bellator 206, which MMA fans awaited overnight, turned into "Pig Pigeon Page."
Imagine you're unsleep all night, waiting for the Bellator 206 game, but at the end of the day you are told that you can't watch the main event.
San Jose has 13 games, of which the main event is six. The British Channel 5 livestreams the game night by night.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the channel's content was changed to "Pig Pigeon Page", which British viewers greatly shocked.
Some people were unsleep, waiting for the early morning, deliberately to watch this boxing game, but dropped their glasses.
On Twitter, a fan said that turning the show into an animated film was simply "a joke of depressing people."
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the program's broadcast, "the government has regulations that such programs should not be played at 6:00 a.m. so television was forced to switch to children's programmes."
"Pitch Pigs," yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator Corporation, said that in future arrangements the British audience will be included as much as possible.
"I think the problem can be solved when considering replay," Coker said.
"But it was six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, but we can only wait for our side of the day to be re-released.
But we are still looking for a way.
I believe that after the program was changed, I received a lot of information and were unfriendly content.
We were also able to figure it out, and we thought it was a technical failure.
But that's not the question of government regulation.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We're going to control five games instead of six, usually we're all playing five and we wanted to give fans more fun but it was too long.
"The situation is somewhat embarrassing."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Downplayed by Sexual Orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt self-degraded from a young age because of his sexual orientation, but it also became the driving force for his success.
The 24-year-old said that after going to high school, he found "not everyone is like me."
In Desert Island Discs, a broadcast channel 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights just to give others "hope."
He also said that after having a child, he had less to do with getting the Olympic champion.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this program, has been retiring for several months due to illness.
As a guest at Laverne's first host of the show, Daley said he felt "lowest" in his growth than others because "the society did not accept intercourse between boys and girls of same sex."
He said, "To this day I will still feel really hard, low-level people and feel different, but it also gives me the strength to succeed."
He says he wants to prove that he has "made a difference" so that people don't disappoint when they know their sexual orientation.
Daley, who has won two Olympic bronze medals and is now a high-profile LGBT activist, met at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said he dared to speak because he felt lucky that he was able to live openly without any consequences and wanted to "hope" for others.
The three-time world champion said he met American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black in 2013 and when he found himself in love with the man, "I was astonished myself."
Last year, Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner and said age gaps were never a problem.
Daley took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at age 14, and three years later his father died of cancer. He said: "When it came to such a small age, there was so much experience that it would be difficult to find people with similar ages."
The couple had their son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. After that, Daley's "whole view" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there is something more important than the Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
He took the same name for his son, Robert, to commemorate his father who died of brain cancer in 2011 (aged 40).
Daley said his father didn't believe he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether there were tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'Father, you can't sit in the front row'," he said.
"When he stops breathing, I'm holding his hand, and in fact, until he stops breathing and is dead, I admit that he won't never fall," he said.
The second year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze medals.
"I just knew at the time that this was what I had dreamt of my life, diving in front of home audiences during the Olympics and not feeling better than it," he said.
And that's why Proud by Heather Small became his favorite song, he fell in love with the song during the preparations for the Olympics and now, hearing it, he will be one of them.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 (BST) and BBC Radio Channel 4.
Poor-balled Mickelson was swapped for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
U.S. player Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he has to adjust his state to avoid negative milestones.
Mickelson, the 12th time in this biannual event, was replaced by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's four-four and four-two matches.
The five-time Grand Slam winner not only became a strong force of the game as it was in the United States, but instead spent one day on Lara and training grounds, hoping to correct their problems as soon as possible.
Even during the peak of his career, with the most straight golf poles and an atmosphere of tension in France's National Golf Course (Le Golf National) is not suitable for the 48-year-old, where a lowly route will make it harder to shoot off track.
If the stadium itself isn't strong enough, Mickelson will take full victory in Sunday's ninth match against Francesco Molinari, a British golf open champion who has worked with novice Tommy Fleetwood to win their games this Thursday.
If the U.S. team starts 12 singles with a four-point draw, then Mikelson's game will be crucial if it is to strike a good start.
Forrick said he had confidence in his teammates, but there was nothing else to say.
"He fully understands the role he plays today, snapped my back and hugged me with his arm to say he'll be ready tomorrow," Forrick said.
"He is very confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Famer, who has contributed immensely to the team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I want him to play more games, but that's the result and it has to be accepted.
Like everyone else, he wants to be a great player in the game."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break the record for Nick Faldo's best-selling Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of Ryder Cup's career, and his personal record has never reached such a high.
Mickelson scored 18 wins and 20 negative seven points, although Forrick said his appearance brought some intangible strength to the team.
"He's funny, spicy, witty, and likes to laugh at others, he's a great guy in the team," he explained.
"I think the young players like to tease him, and this week it will be fun.
In addition to the game, he brought us a lot."
European captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that the big-ranking situation is about to be broken
Captain Thomas Bjorn from Europe, according to experience, enters the Ryder Cup's single-time final with a leading advantage that is easy to create an unfavorable situation.
Deyne made his first appearance in Valderrama in 1997, when Seve Ballesteros was one of the captains of the team ahead of the U.S. with a five-point advantage, but ultimately only winning 141/2-131/2 with an extremely weak advantage.
After watching two games in 2018 held on Friday and yesterday at the French National Golf Course (5-3 wins respectively, ultimately leading by 10-6), Bijorn described that "you should always remind yourself that we have been ahead of Valderrama and Brooklyn; although we lost in Brooklyn, we were victorious in Valderrama."
History will tell me and every teammate that everything is not over.
You have to do your best before tomorrow arrives.
Go out and do the right thing.
Everything didn't end until the score hits the scoring list.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that's our focus.
"I've been saying that I care about the 12 players in our team, but we are very clear what we are going to face-the most powerful player in the world."
Bijorn was satisfied with the tough confrontation between the players on the golf course, he added: "In this regard, I have never been able to overcome myself.
Tomorrow is another horrific battle.
Tomorrow is a self-promoting personal show, somewhat different from usual.
If the game goes well and fights side-by-side with a partner will be great, but if an lone soldier fights, as a golfer, the test will be your overall ability.
That's the message you need to make your teammates understand, and full personal ability will be unleashed tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner and your partner must also leave you, each with the fullest of their abilities."
Unlike Bijorn, Jimmy Furyk expects the team's personal performance to outperform their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who scored three in four.
As the European team struggled to achieve "Miracle at Medinah" ended in defeat, as part of Brookleyn's winning team, Forrick has already stood at both ends of the final turning point, and it is possible to win or lose.
Asked about how Ben Crenshaw (1999's current captain) had inspired morale for the finalists, he replied: "I remember every damn word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you might imagine being pre-emptive in Valderrama and Brooklyn.
If everyone moves in the same direction, then it will put a lot of pressure on midfielders.
"So our lineup has been adjusted accordingly to play in a way that is good for us, and everyone knows we are trying to make miracles tomorrow."
Thomas is responsible for the team's backlash, and he will play against European players such as Rory McIlroy in the finals, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the semifinals.
Speaking of singles, Bijorn said: "I'm deploying players in this order is a decision taken after all aspects are considered."
Germany's new warship rescheduled
According to local media reports, the latest German Navy frigate should have been decommissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but due to system failures and cost of snowballing growth, we could not see the frigate debut until next year.
According to Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesman said the debugging of the new Baden-Wurttemberg frigate - "Rheinland-Pfartz" - was currently postponed until the first half of 2019.
The frigate was supposed to have served in the Navy in 2014, but head-wrenching post-production problems consistently plagued the fate of this vast project.
Four Baden-Wurttemberg frigates recalled by the Navy in 2007 will replace old Baden-Wurttemberg frigates.
It is understood that the frigate will have powerful firepower, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance cycles - a two-year deployment of the latest frigates away from home ports.
However, a continuous extension means that the state-of-the-art warships - which are said to allow Germany to deploy troops overseas - will be outdated when it is put into service.
As early as last year, when the German Navy officially refused to debug the frigate and returned it to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, the fateful F125 frigate became a news focus.
It was the Navy's first shipment to be returned to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for this return, but German media cited some key "software and hardware flaws," saying that these flaws would make warships useless in carrying out combat missions.
Because the Baden-Wurttemberg frigate will be operated by 120 crew members, only half of the manpower of the old Baden-Wurttemberg frigate is required, so software flaws will be particularly deadly.
Similarly, the frigate is severely overweight, which will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland Phartz" is said to weigh twice as much as the same class of frigates used in Germany during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a headache.
Expenditures are said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared with the initial budget of just 2.2 billion euros.
In light of recent warnings that German naval forces are shrinking, the problem with the latest frigate is getting worse.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliamentary Defence Committee, admitted that the German Navy was "no longer capable of deploying ships."
The official said the issue was getting worse over time, with older ships gradually decommissioning but there were no new vessels that could be replaced.
He lamented that no Baden-Wurttemberg frigate could serve the Navy.
The National Trust Listen to the Secret Lives of Bats
A manor in Scotland's highlands is conducting a new study that aims to reveal how bats use the land for food.
The study hopes that the findings will uncover this unique flying mammalian behavior veil and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will track common avalanche and high sound avalanche wings as well as brown long ear bats and Daubenton bats in Wester Ross' Inverewe Gardens.
They will install special recording machines in some key locations around the garden to track bats' activities for four seasons of the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors for mobile surveys.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings is then carried out to determine the frequency of bat calls and what activities are being performed.
Then create a habitat map and report to generate detailed live images for the behavior of bats.
Rob Dewar, a NHS conservation consultant, hopes the findings will reveal which habitats are critical to bats and how each bat uses them.
This information will help judge the benefits of habitat management work, such as grass paving and how to most effectively maintain bats and other related species.
But the number of bats in Scotland and England has plummeted over the past century.
Building and development work poses a huge threat to bats, affecting their habitats or even causing them to lose their habitat.
The chemical treatment of wind turbines and lighting, fly logging and some building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats, poses a risk to the bats.
Bats can actually be seen.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they hunt.
They are able to accurately locate small worms and obstacles in the flight path using sophisticated echolocation techniques.
NTS, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings in Scotland, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, take the issue of bats very seriously.
NTS has 10 war-torn experts who regularly investigate, detect and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dunfries and Galloway, home to eight (10) types of bats in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, said it was the ideal fertile ground for bats.
"In Threave Manor, we built a region for bats," Thompson said.
"Here are old buildings, slabs of old trees and all the perfect habitat.
But there is still a lot of unknown knowledge about bats, so the work we do here and in other manorings will help us learn more about how bats can thrive.
Thompson emphasizes that bats must be checked before manor maintenance is carried out, because if an uninformed destruction of a female bat habitat can lead to the death of up to 400 female bats and bat pups, leading to the complete extinction of local populations.
Bats are protected and killing, attacking, harassing or destroying their habitats are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to contribute.
"We still have a lot of knowledge for bats and many other species we don't know about their populations," she said.
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers ready to indict German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, nicknamed "fake news" for rape charges, said people wanted to use him to "hype themselves."
His lawyer is ready to sue the German news magazine, "Mindson Weekly".
The Portuguese and Juventus forwards were accused of raping American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a 2009 room at a Las Vegas hotel.
According to Mirror Weekly on Friday, Ronaldo was alleged to have paid the woman $375,000 afterward, leaving her unspoken about the incident.
Hours after the charges were exposed, 33-year-old Ronaldo released a live video on Instagram to 142 million followers, accusing them of being "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they're saying today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Globe winner.
"They just wanted to use my name to hype themselves.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my fame, but it's also part of their work.
"I'm a happy person, all right," Ronaldo added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are poised to indict Bloomberg on the charges, calling it "unauthorized reports of alleged violations of personal privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would seek compensation for "the amount of mental damages corresponding to the severity of the violation, which could be the most serious human rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, in June 2009.
According to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub where there were rapes.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" of his time as a gentleman, while now being dragged down by 1 percent.
The document states Ronaldo admits that the two men have sex, but both are voluntary.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and photographed her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearing of reprisals" and worried about "public humiliation."
Mayorga, 34, said that she was currently seeking to overturn outside reconciliation as a result of her continuing mental trauma due to the alleged impact of the incident.
Ronaldo is about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged case, and this summer Ronaldo has joined Juventus in Italy for a fee of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain loses automaker 'to be its forever regret'
Britain's Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said that losing its position as a global leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit would "be forever regrettable."
He added that the UK's Toyota plant told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, Toyota will temporarily stop production at a Bernaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said Britain would leave the EU without a deal, and border delays could lead to fewer jobs.
The Bernerston plant, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, our factories will stop producing," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota's Bernston Factory.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, also said they were worried about what would happen if there was no agreement on cross-border trade operations after Brexit.
For example, BMW said it would close the Oxford-based mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern for automakers is Brexit without an agreement and there may be supply chain risks.
Toyota's production line operates on a "timetable" basis and receives car orders from UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK exits the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be a disruption to its borders, according to industry sources, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
The company said the Toyota plant in Derbyshire could not hold inventory for more than a day, so production would stop.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "has been accurately reconciled to avoid border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the most successful agreement, both to achieve current success and to allow us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio's 4's Today program.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers shows that we need absolute capacity to continue to drive a series of productive supply chains."
Toyota did not say how long it would be shut down, but in the long run, cost growth will weaken the factory's competitiveness and ultimately affect job opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the Bernerston plant and is currently a co-convenor of the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "Based on my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again."
A government spokesman said: "We have developed precise and reliable plans for our future relationship with the EU."
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said Sunday that as the winds of Supreme Court candidate Bretkavano have not yet subsided, a high-end meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for a week."
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, while Robert Mueller's campaign team is accused of stealing Russia and investigations that the president may have impeded justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister, jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been debated in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a hear record of conversations with Trump and whether it was possible to oust the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House in a covert report that said he was about to resign.
On Thursday, news announced that he had a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but later postponed the meeting in order to avoid clashes with Senate Judiciary Committee hearings where Kavanaugh and a woman accused of sexual misconduct Dr. Cristina Bracy Ford will be present for testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into Kavanaugh and postponed full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "Given all other things that are going on in the Supreme Court, it may be a week late and specific dates have not yet been determined, I think, maybe this week."
But we will see this day and I will always inform the media about progress."
Some news outlets have refuted this claim: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the absence of a press conference was not because she hated television journalists' "rebellious preferences," although she said: "I will not object to their reports of popular preference."
She later said it would increase direct contact between Trump and the media.
"President Trump has more questions and answers than any other president ever," she said.
Sanders said a press conference would still be held, but "if the media had an opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that would be much better than talking to me."
We've organized as many questions and answers as possible, and we did organize a number of times in the past few weeks, when you can speak directly with the President of the United States, it will cancel the press conference.
Trump often sets up a question-and-answer link when leaving the White House or attending public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
There are very few separate press conferences.
This week, in New York, the president may have explained to us why this is behind him, appearing undisturbed before a gathering of journalists and sometimes even acting strangely.
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff in the Scottish National Healthcare System (NHS) on Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff from the Scottish National Medical Service System (NHS), expressing his country's gratitude for them and hoping they would remain in Scotland after Brexit.
Jean Freeman of the Medical Care Program (MSP) sent a letter within six months of Britain's exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to pay the costs of applying for settlement status for EU citizens working in their transferred public service sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit have been going on throughout the summer and are expected to make a decision this autumn.
But the British government is also stepping up preparations for a possible uncoordinated situation.
I know that this time must feel very uneasy for you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of your nationality.
Invaluable experience and skills offered by colleagues inside and outside the EU will strengthen and improve our healthcare work for the benefit of patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is always your home, and we very much hope that you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Mike Organ, Tennessee reported that the Tennessee State Tigers defeated Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday with 31-27 and in a match where the tycoon defender Christion Abercrombie suffered head injuries after undergoing an emergency surgery.
Tennessee State Tigers coach Rod Reed told reporters that Abercromby was injured shortly before the end of the half-time.
"He ran to the border and then suddenly fell down," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel lost oxygen to Abercromby next to the border, then carried him on a stretcher and brought him back for further assessment.
An official from Tennessee State Tigers team revealed to Chris Harris of WSMV News in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/degree of the injury has not yet been determined", while Tennessee State University Tigers are working hard to understand the exact time for the injury.
Abercrombie is a college 2nd grade redshirt player student, which was his first season at Tennessee State University after he moved from Illinois to come here.
He completed five shovels before exiting the game on Saturday, raising his total number of season shovels to 18.
Higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who buy homes in the UK
According to the newly launched Conservative program, the UK will collect stamp duty on foreign buyers who buy property in the UK and the tax collected will be used to help tackle homelessness.
This move will offset the success of Corbyn in attracting young voters
In addition, stamp duty is targeted at non-taxing groups in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be levied a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and an additional income tax fee will be used to help homeless people.
The move also promises to provide more affordable housing and lock up high-income people. It is also seen as a counterbalance to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The additional stamp duty is targeted at non-taxable individuals and companies in the UK, with additional funds being made available to improve government solutions to housing issues.
In addition to the current stamp duty, including a second set of housing and rental taxes introduced two years ago, surcharges may be as high as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new London properties are purchased by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to buy.
Many wealthy parts of the UK, especially London, have become "ghost cities" because a large number of foreign homebuyers are not in the UK for most of the time.
Just before the new policy was introduced, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining a high level of house prices by looting land, rather than using land, and urged Ms. May to abandon quotas for affordable housing and address the UK's "home disgrace."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of housing reform proposals that have garnered many eyebrows, including rental controls and the end of "innocuous" relocations.
He also hoped that the parliament would be given greater powers to build new houses.
"Last year I said that during my term as Prime Minister, I would restore the British's dream and make life better for every new generation."
This means rehabilitating the fragmented housing market.
Britain will always welcome those who want to live, work and build families here.
However, for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign companies, it is not right that hardworking British residents are uniquely difficult to buy homes.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far off and the insults of lodging are still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ideal is to be a Scottish coach."
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "final ideal" was one day to become a Scottish coach.
The 42-year-old Scotsman, who was trying to revive the Northeast team, is currently ranked third and three points behind first.
After leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish League last season, this summer it was relegated to the Stadium of Light.
"I want to play for my motherland as a player.
I got a B-hat, that's it." Ross wanted the BBC's Scottish Sport Sound show.
"I'm watching the Scots race grow up and often watch it with my dad at Hampton when I was a kid, and I always remember that time.
But only if I bring the team very successfully, I will have such an opportunity."
Prior to Ross, Sunderland coaches included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said there were so many well-known characters in such a large club that he didn't feel frightened by rejecting the invitations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Whether or not my success now depends on 'Can I bring the team back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this team, it will certainly be able to hit the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy for this task, but only if I lead the team back to the Premier League can I find myself successful."
He had been an assistant coach at Denpaton for a while and worked in the Red Heart Team's coaching group for 15 months.
Afterwards, he led Arrow from the downgrade to the third tier, and in the following season, as well as leading St. Milen from the edge of the downgrade to the championship.
Ross said he feels more comfortable now than his previous careers in Clyde, Harttlepool, Falkirk, St. Milen and Hamilton Academical teams.
Reminiscent of his experience with the Arrow team, he said: "It could be a real crossroad.
I really feel that I'm better suited to being a coach than playing football.
This sounds strange because I'm doing well, there is no problem with this life and it really has a lot of fun.
But playing football can be tough sometimes.
There is a lot of work to do every week.
I'll still feel the pressure to play football, but what I do as a coach feels good.
"I've always wanted to be a coach and now I did it, this is the most comfortable day of my adult life."
12:00 - 13:00 on Sunday, September 30th in the UK, you can listen to a full interview at Radio Scotland.
The survey found that Saturday's 5:30 p.m. is the best place to get a refreshing drink.
The summer heat, the hard-fought bar in England generates revenue, and the chain of restaurants is under heavy pressure.
In July, bar sales increased by 2.7%, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consulting firm at CGA, said: "The heat of the day, coupled with more than expected time for England's World Cup games, has recured in July (bar revenue increased by 2.8% during June), and restaurants have been hit harder."
Restaurant volume fell 1.8% in June, while the decline was even greater in July.
Wine and beverages are best performed in the main bars, with volumes of restaurants continuing to decline from year-on-year.
Restaurant-based bars have also been affected by the heat, although their impact is relatively small compared to restaurant operators.
People seem to just think about drinking something outside.
Wine sales for the entire bar industry increased by 6.6% this month and food sales fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "This trend has been continuing since the end of April.
Among the main factors affecting sales in the external consumer market, the biggest factor is weather and important social events or sporting events.
Unsurprisingly, the continued bitterness of the catering industry, compared with a 4.8% decline in sales year-on-year, is more headaches due to continuing increased cost stress.
For food-based operators, the effects of long and hot summers can be described as a sunny thunderbolt, and time will tell us whether the temperature in August is moderate to bring the necessary breath.
Overall sales for the entire bar and restaurant industry, including newly opened bars and restaurants, rose 2.7% in July, showing a slowdown in brand promotion.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK's bar and restaurant industry monitoring body, collected and analyzed performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than PS9 billion to set benchmarks for the industry.
One in five minors hide their parents and secretly use social media
According to the survey, one in five minors (as young as 11) secretly use social media for their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 middle school students showed increased use of the "fake Insta" page
The news sparked concerns about the publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to deal with parents
One in five minors (under the age of 11) hide from adults and use social media.
A survey of 20,000 middle-aged students showed that the use of fake Insta accounts (meaning Image Sharing Site Instagram) has grown rapidly.
The news sparked concerns about the publication of pornographic content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "purified" main account for parents and other secret accounts.
A mother stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, who found a teenager encouraging others to "rape me."
The survey, co-sponsored by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses Conference (HMC), found that 40% of minors aged 11-18 have two accounts at the same time, half of whom admit to having a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, said: "So many teenagers create cyberspace hiding in them and parents and teachers don't know it is really disturbing."
Eilidh Doyle will join the Scottish Athletics Council as "the spokesperson for athletes"
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual general meeting of government agencies.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning tracker, and Ian Beattie, the chairman of the committee, said the move was a great opportunity for athletic trainers to gain an international level of experience.
"Erid has a reputation in Scotland, England and the world's sporting circles, and we believe that if he joins the committee, Scottish athletics will certainly benefit," Betty said.
"I'm very willing to be an advocate for athletes and I want to be able to make a real contribution to Scotland's sporting career and help provide guidance."
The American athlete has won four Olympic gold medals, of which 200 meters and 400 meters were awarded in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and currently serves as a long-time guest commentator for the BBC (BBC), unable to walk after experiencing a brief cerebral ischemic episode.
He tweeted: Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
Impossible to walk.
Doctors say that the extent to which I can recover depends entirely on time.
Full recovery and re-learning walking is a difficult task, but now I have been able to complete agility training!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
Breast-smoking ads comparing mothers to cows make internet users controversial
In an advertisement released by a dairy suction company, comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are excreted has sparked differences among netizens.
When launching the new product, "The world's first silent wearable breast suction machine," consumer technology company Elvie released a witty music video inspiration advertisement showing the freedom that this new type of milk suction machine brings to mothers.
Four real mothers danced with music in a cow shed full of grass, and some of the lyrics were as follows: "Yes, I feed myself, but you can't see your tail," or "didn't find my big milk, actually my breasts."
The following lyrics are: "Take out, suck out, feed my little baby, pull out, squeeze out, grandma my little princess."
But after the advertisement was posted on the company's Facebook page, it stoked controversy online.
The video was viewed by 77,000 people with hundreds of reviews and the audience reacted in a variety of ways that many felt were suspected of contempt for the dairy industry's "terror."
"The decision to advertise this product with cows is too wrong.
Cows, like us, need to have milk in pregnancy but the difference is that cow's babies will be stolen a few days after delivery," one netizen wrote.

Another netizen commented: "This is certainly a trauma for mothers and babies.
Why do you want to make your mother more than a city cow in the milking ads, Mom can't want children to leave themselves?"
Another netizen added: "This advertisement is too unrealistic."
Others thought the advertisement was good, and one woman admitted that she found the song "funny."
"I think this idea is particularly new.
If I am still breastfeeding, I will buy one.
The process of sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit overrun, but I think it's good.
This product is very new," a netizen wrote.
Another netizen commented: The funny ads are aimed at moms who need to suck milk (often in the company or toilet) and feel like a cow.
"It is not unintentional to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of mothers showed themselves when they danced, in fact, the chest also wears a milk suction machine.
This post-advertising advertisement comes from the idea that many women call themselves cows while sucking milk.
However, the Elvie milk absorber is completely mute and without wires or tubes can be perfectly placed in the breastfeeding, allowing women to liberate their hands, hold babies, and even continue to suck when they are out.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother (ECD), commented: "Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product worth boldly trying.
By comparing breastfeeding moms and cows, we want to place the process of sucking milk and its problems under the spotlight while demonstrating in an interesting and connected way that this new type of straw can bring a sense of unparalleled freedom.
This is not the first time that Elvie's milk suction cup has come up with news.
During London Fashion Week, two children's mothers boarded T in costumes designed by designer Marta Jakubowski when she wore the product.
Hundreds of mobile children are quietly moving to a campground on the Texas border
While the policy of border crossings is relatively unchanged every month, the number of detained mobile children continues to rise sharply, partly due to the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it harder for sponsors to relocate their children.
Legend has it that most patrons themselves are illegal immigrants, fearing that standing up to adopt children could jeopardize their possibility of staying in the United States.
In June, federal authorities announced that potential patrons and other adult family members must submit fingerprints, and the authorities will share their fingerprint information with the Immigration Service, leading to a significant increase in risk.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested were unsuspected.
"Nearly 80% of individuals who are patrons or family members of sponsors enter illegally, most of them transnational criminals."
So we're constantly chasing these people," Albertsett said.
According to shelter staff, in order to address these children as soon as possible, officials have introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear within a month of detention (rather than the 60 days previously prescribed).
Many children will not appear in court in person, instead, they will appear in the form of video conferencing to defend their legal identity with immigration judges.
Children who are deemed to be ineligible for relief will be promptly deported.
According to shelter staff and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are detained, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, leading to acts of violence or attempted escape.
Defence lawyers said concerns were even more serious in large facilities like Tornillo, where the size of such a site was too large and it was easy to ignore signs of child resistance.
They added that moving the child to a tent city without enough time for emotional preparation and not enough time for goodbye with friends could exacerbate many of the traumas children had already suffered.
Syria Urges U.S., French and Turkish "Occupying Forces" to Move Immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem's speech to the United Nations General Assembly also called for Syrian refugees to return as soon as possible, even though the war in Syria has been going on for eight years.
Mualim, who also served as Syria's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces illegally entered Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism "will be treated accordingly."
"They must immediately and unconditionally evacuate," Mualim told the UN General Assembly.
Mualim insists that Syria's "war on terror is about to end" has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions since 2011.
He said the Damascus side would continue to "fight against this sacrificial war until we clear all terrorist organizations and "all illegal foreign forces" on Syrian territory.
With more than 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, the United States is primarily responsible for providing training and advice to Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French soldiers are stationed in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mualim said conditions allowed them to return and condemned "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that forced them to leave their homes.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They are politicizing purely humanitarian issues."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction assistance to Syria until Assad has reached a political agreement with the opposition to end the war.
United Nations (UN) diplomats said Russia and Turkey had recently reached an agreement to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib, which created opportunities for advancing political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-backed Syrian army from launching a massive attack on three million-strong provinces.
However, Mualim stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed his hope that military operations would target jihadists, including militants from al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.
UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that a new committee of government and opposition members will convene its first meeting as soon as possible to draft Syria's post-war constitution, paving the way for elections.
Mualim listed the conditions for the Syrian government's membership in the committee, saying its work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump wins re-election
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachment and scandals terminate his presidential term in advance as many free viewers wish.
"This will be the most dramatic end of a presidential term ever!"
But so far, people don't seem to have any signs of aesthetic fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's peak-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million, while Microsoft National Broadcasting Corporation (MSNBC) tripled to 1.6 million.
Nielsen data shows that Fox News' average viewership for primetime increased from 1.7 million four years ago to 2.4 million, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" holds the lead on cable with a total of 3.5 million spectators in major nighttime news.
For the cabinet minister who became president after an attack that destroyed the U.S. Capitol Building, ABC producer Neal Baer said: "Because we don't understand, people are attracted like moths."
Nell Scovell, the author of The Funny Parts: And A Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, insists on another theory.
Scottville told me that she still remembers taking a taxi in Boston on the eve of the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he can make me laugh.'
There is no lack of entertainment in the turmoil.
Of course, unlike other shows on television, regardless of whether the immigrant family will eventually reunite and whether the global economy can develop healthyly, this Washington storyline is likely to determine the future of Roe v. Wade.
The tuning is a luxury pleasure that only the most privileged audience can afford.
However, when you find yourself having watched the panel discussion for six hours in a row about the "deep background" roots used by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich hair short jacket (the Washington Post called it "arrogantly thick clothes") and Stomy Daniels' sensational description of Trump (UH, bones), you will find this far beyond the knowledge of an ordinary citizen.
For me, I'm not going to see Super Mario again in the same way.
Brent Montgomery, chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars" (Brent Montgomery) on Trump's show role rotation and day-to-day tangled plots (searching for provocation against the U.S. Rugby League, chanting Kim Jong Un), said: "Some things he is doing make it feel like a reality show that he instills something into you every night."
You can't miss a single episode, otherwise you won't be able to keep up with it.
The day I met with Fleiss this week was a clear day when he had an outdoor temperature of up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the north bank of Caoai, but while recording CNN's show, he kept watching MSNBC in his house.
Without Brett Kavanaugh confronting the Senate Judiciary Committee with him, the future of the Supreme Court is still unsolved and he feels unable to get rid of himself.
"I remember when we planned those crazy shows behind the scenes during the day, people said, 'This is a sign of the end of Western civilization.'
"I thought it sounded like a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Big cash poured into the fiercest congressional midterm elections for Household seats battle
The reclassification of the congressional constituency, which led two current lawmakers to compete for the same seat in Pennsylvania's 17th constituency, was no surprise that a large number of cash flows were constantly flowing.
The recently redrawn suburban Pittsburgh constituency became the target of Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb's race, and he won another constituency in a special election last spring.
Ramm's rival is incumbent Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the original Pennsylvania 12th constituency that overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old congressional constituency map was favourable to Republicans, an unconstitutional act and thus redivided the constituency.
The race for the 17th new seat in the constituency sparked a campaign finance issue between the main party's financial sectors - the Democratic Congressional Election Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
In the March 18th Special Elections in Pennsylvania, where Rum won with a weak advantage, he became a household name in Pennsylvania.
Previously, the seat was stabilized by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won with a 20-percentage margin in this constituency.
Politicians have created a little advantage for the Democratic Party.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but eventually opted to give up.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already accredited Beijing, virtually unstoppable by Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, after which he stayed in Panama until his partners expelled the administration's management team.
Secretary of State spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that state officials decided to "no longer recognize Taiwan's recent decision," reverting to the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions based in Salva, Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only consider punishing El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid for drug control, development and economic support from the United States in 2017.
The formulation of punitive measures, including the reduction of economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be a serious blow to the Central American country and its higher unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue similar gatherings held last year, an act seen as a big step forward in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials had made clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, which effectively ended the idea of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence, who is currently scheduled to speak at a meeting expected in mid-October, said diplomats that it was a signal of the importance government authorities have attached to this meeting.
Three U.S. special envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without being barred or punished by Washington's latest hard information.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss the internal review on an anonymous basis.
An external analyst who is close to the government and unwilling to be named confirms their claims.
Research History
The next thing that needs to be addressed may be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's possible impediment to justice, which has been well documented in public records.
Miller has reportedly shifted the direction of his investigation to whether Trump colluded in campaigning about Russia's attack on our election.
If Congress's elder lord, Trump will face congressional accountability, and when he is ready to re-elect, perhaps eventually only a jury of his colleagues remains.
There are a lot of hypothetical factors in this, and I don't mean that Trump's failure is the inevitable outcome - nor does his failure in Europe be the inevitable result.
Everyone on both sides of the Atlantic can make choices, and those choices will determine the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler on the premise that the Western world resisted Hitler in Munich and supported Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the best opportunity to avoid the ensuing years-long Holocaust.
The course of history is always centred on these turning points, and the unstoppable pace of democratic progress either accelerates or slows down.
Today, Americans are facing several such turning points.
If Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Miller's investigation of fate, what should we do?
Since the newspaper reported last year that Rosenstein had suggested making secret recordings of the president and suspected Trump was not fit for this role, Rosenstein has become an ant on a hot pot.
Rosenstein said the Times's statement was inaccurate.
"If the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) just requested an investigation into Brett Kavanaug is not comprehensive or unfair - or if the Supreme Court does not consider credible allegations of sexual assault and fraudulent testimony to be true, how would we respond?
First, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress to be held by Trump?
If the attempt fails, Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I firmly believe that we will not fail because I have learned the lessons of Prague.
My mother, a Czechoslovak Jew, was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived and later emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later my mother sent me to that Nazi-marked table to light a Sabbath candle.
With this right of inheritance, how can I be disillusioned with our future?

Graham Dorrans, a roaming group, is optimistic about the confrontation with the Vienna Rapids.
On Thursday, the Rangers sailed for the Viennese Rapids on their home side, and after playing Spain's Villariels earlier this month they knew that victory was gaining hands with the Austrians, which would set a favorable position for their departure from the European League G group.
Knee injuries made midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to attend this season's debut before the 2-2 victory over Villarrill, but he believed that the Rangers could use it as a springboard for better results.
"This is a great opportunity for us because the Villarrills are strong," said Graham Dorrans, 31.
"Before the game began, we believed that we must not rebuke and eventually we won a point.
Perhaps we shouldn't have stopped at this, but eventually ended up in a blunder.
They played better in the first half, and we did better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European night.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tricky game because they have made good results in the last match, but there are so many people who support us and I am sure we can continue to make good progress.
Last year was undoubtedly a very tough year, and many things happened after I got hurt, and the club itself had some changes, but now we feel good.
The team is good, the players are enjoying the game and training is very smooth.
Hopefully, we can keep going beyond last season and succeed.
Women are insomnia due to fear of retirement savings
While survey participants were aware of what kind of care they wanted, few people had ever talked to their families about the issue.
In the Nationalwide study, about half said they had talked to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about the topic.
"People all want family members to take care of themselves, but they haven't tried to communicate with their families," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance Business at Nationwide.
How to start, see below.
Communicate with spouses and children: If you don't tell your family in advance, the family can't be prepared to take care of you.
Talk with your advisors and family about where to care and how to get the details of care, as these choices are important factors that determine costs.
Involvement of financial advisors: Your advisers can also help you find ways to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a cash value blended life insurance that can be used to cover these costs or self-insurance for your own wealth (as long as you have money).
Preparation of legal documents: to avoid legal disputes at the juncture.
Arrange a healthcare agent so you can designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professional caregivers are able to comply with your wishes when you cannot communicate with them.
In addition, a financial authorisation is prepared.
You can choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you get paid when you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that older parents are experiencing emergency medical problems on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
These details are detailed in your written plan so you can prepare.
"It doesn't just affect financial issues, who is the doctor?" asked Martin.
What drugs are you taking?
Who cares about the patient?
Develop these plans."
The man was shot several times by an air rifle in Irflekom
A man left home in the evening and was shot several times by an air rifle.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was attacked in the Oxford Grove district of Irflekom, Devonshire, with gunshots on his chest, stomach and hand.
The incident occurred around 02:30 in the British summer, and police called it a "dissensual murder."
The injured man did not see the face of the attacker.
At present, men's injuries are not life-threatening and police call on eyewitnesses to provide clues.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia
Indonesia officials said a strong earthquake and tsunami in Bahru on Friday had killed at least 384 people, with the number of deaths still rising.
Due to the disruption of communications, rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala County, which is located in northern Barru, close to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Barru, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some of the key facts about Barru and Dungala on Sulawesi:
Baru is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow long bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city is celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dungala is a county that stretches over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline along the northwest of Sulawesi.
The county is a sub-provincial administrative region with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining also occupies an important position in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali County on the side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Bahru and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Tangara.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Tangara, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in an earthquake-prone Pacific volcanic belt, so it often suffers from earthquake attacks.
Here are some major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed more than 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were Aqsi residents.
2005: In late March and early April, heavy earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the southern coast of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake near Baton, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mindaway Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Al-Aqsi's Pydiaya district, causing serious damage and reminiscent of the destruction caused by a deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004, which also triggered extreme panic.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but the collapsed buildings also killed more than 100 people.
2018: A major earthquake hit Indonesia's touristic island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people and most of the dead are active on the north side of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for alleged domestic violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for allegedly assaulting others.
According to a report on domestic violence and denial of arrest released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Pelin, 29, was arrested for alleged domestic violence.
According to police reports, a familiar woman tried to report her suspected crime and Pelin took the phone from her hand.
According to KTUU, Pelin is currently held in the Mat-Su pretrial facility and holds $500 worth of unsecured bonds.
According to online reports, the court asked him to defend on Saturday's appearance, claiming he was "truely innocent."
Peling faces three counts of A minor offenses, meaning he may be jailed for a year and fined $250,000.
At the same time, he was also accused of a B-degree misdemeanor that could be punishable by one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
However, this is not the first time Pelin has been facing criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother Sarah Palin told the police that she was suspected of an attack.
The case is currently under trial in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, a report on the crime of domestic violence accused Pering of domestic violence and sparked drunken gunshots.
Pelling's girlfriend claims she hit her face with a boxer.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was condemned by the Veterans' organization for alleged violence against her son related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of people killed
The Indonesian earthquake in Sulawesi on Friday has killed at least 384 people.
The magnitude of the earthquake was 7.5, followed by a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication networks are paralyzed, and the death toll is expected to continue in the coming days.
The earthquake took place in central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social media, video of disaster situations is paving the way.
When the tsunami hit, hundreds of people celebrated the festival on a beach in Palu City.
Federal prosecutor seeks rare death penalty for suspects of terrorist attack in New York
U.S. federal prosecutors in New York want to impose the death penalty on a New York suspect Sayfullo Saipov, who has killed eight people as a rare case of this crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov drove home Depot rental trucks on the west side of Manhattan's lower city highway, driving into a bicycle lane, crushing pedestrians and bicyclists.
According to a letter of intent on seeking the death penalty filed in New York's Southern District, prosecutors must prove that Sypov was the "intentional" killing of eight victims and an "intentional" injury to others.
According to this court document, both charges are punishable by death.
After weeks of the attack, a grand jury in the U.S. announced that Sapov was charged with 22 counts including eight murders, support for blackmail (the charges used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases) and violent destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "a lot of planning and premeditated work" and described what Saipov's approach to the attack was "egregious, cruel and depraved."
In the letter of intent, it was stated that "Safullo Saipov caused great harm and loss to the families and friends of the victims Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in the Southern District of New York has been suing death sentences for ten years.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug providers, but eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last execution was in a federal court in New York in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder. The couple were executed for Soviet spying during the Cold War two years ago.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were executed by electric chairs.
The court documents show that Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, did not demonstrate any self-defence in the days or even months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone before launching the attack.
Police said he also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his ward.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were "particularly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek death sentences without accepting life imprisonment, which is impossible to release, will only extend the trauma of these incidents to all concerned."
Saipov's defence team has previously asked the prosecution not to seek death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
In a protest at the Conservative Party meeting, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize today's people's army."
The former leader of the Independent Party said politicians must "feel the hype of'skeptical Europeans'" and that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU, as a lawmaker in Theresa May said.
In a march in Birmingham, Conservative lawmaker Peter Bone said that if Mr. Farage was the Brexit secretary then Britain would "be out of Europe long ago."
However, the party's joining a separate protest against Brexit underscored Ms. May's challenges in reconciling deeply divided positions.
Under the jamming of Brexit, left-wing and EU factions, the prime minister is trying to adjust the Chequers plan to get it on track.
The ally insisted that, despite the strong opposition voices, she would continue to work on reaching an agreement with Brussels and force doubters and Labour parties to make a choice between her plans and "disorder."
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave rally that he wanted to "renounce the Chex plan."
He said Mr. Farage should be allowed to walk with himself and take charge of negotiations with Brussels.
He said: "If he is responsible, we'll be out of Europe long ago."
The lawmaker of Wilenburg added: "I'm going to push for Brexit, but we need to give up the Chex plan."
In expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We don't need world wars to make it obeyed."
We want to enact our own laws in our country."
It was suggested that public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016, and Mr. Bone dismissed the proposal: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is not true at all."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative Brexit analyst, also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people's voice.
"The people don't welcome the Chicks plan, opposition parties will no longer vote for it, and our parties and our activists do not welcome this plan, you remember, these are those who cheered us on the street, they were the first to choose us to take office.
Please give up Chekes and listen to people's voices."
In a message to Ms. May, she added: "The prime minister can keep his position only by fulfilling the promise."
Mr Farage told rallies politicians that if they intend to betray the decision in the 2016 referendum, then be sure to "feel the heat of shouting."
"Right now, this issue is about trust between us - people and political strata."
"They want to betray the Brexit faction, and we're here today telling them 'we won't let you do that'."
In a speech to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I hope you can let those political classes who intend to betray the Brexit feel how hot the call is."
"We will mobilise the British People's Army, which contributes to our victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until independence and self-government are achieved."
Meanwhile, the left-wing faction marched in Birmingham and then held two hours of rallies in the city centre.
After the team was formed this weekend, several activists waved the banner of "Conservatives against Brexit".
At the opening of the meeting, labor peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservative party's partisan applications with security problems.
He added: "It's these people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technologies that enable free trade in Canada ++, frictionless borders, Irish borderless borders."
"It's a full-blown farce.
There is nothing so good as Brexit," he added.
Warren Plans to "Considerate" the Election of President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "consider seriously" the election after November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democratic Senator, a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, talked about his plans for the future.
Warren regularly criticizes President Donald Trump, who is currently running for November's election with Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of President Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She has been a focus on speculation about the possible replacement of Trump in 2020.
The event in Holly York City on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting since Trump took office in the form of a rally in the Town Hall.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to enter Washington and rebuild the fragmented government where there is a woman in the top."
Suspects of shooting Louisiana State University (LSU) Simes arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that the suspect of shooting a basketball player Wayde Sims at Louisiana State University (LSU) was arrested on Friday.
At a press conference at 11am Eastern time, Baton Rouge's police station announced that it had arrested the 20-year-old suspect Dyteon Simpson.
Police released a gunshot video on Friday asking people to help identify the men appearing in the video.
Simms, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near South University.
According to 247 sports reports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that "Wayde Sims' head was shot and eventually killed."
Wade defended his friends, and was shot by Simpson.
In the face of questioning, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene and held weapons while also admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Unsurprisingly, Simpson was arrested and detained at the Eastern Baton Rouge parish police station.
Simes, a teenager who grew up in Baton Rouge, six feet 6 inches tall, played 32 games last season and scored 10 firsts with an average score of 17.4 minutes per game at 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton Wins Sebastian Vettel with Team Order
From the moment Valtteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' "team command will play a big part in the race."
Starting from the pole racing, Potas led the way, almost pitting Hamilton during the first two rounds of defense and also lured Vettel to attack teammates.
Vettel first entered the repair station and Hamilton ran to the end of the convoy, which should have determined the ending.
After a round, Mercedes got in the station and lag behind Vettel when he returned to the ranch, after a confrontational fight, so as not to remain unmoved after the third bending double defense, the Ferrari driver reluctantly let go of the inner road, Hamilton regaining lead position.
Max Verstappen, on his 21st birthday, was in the back of the track when he started running and ran to seventh place at the end of the first round.
For most of the game, he went all the way forward and strove to quickly complete the match, surpassing Kimi Raikkonen, running for 4th place.
He eventually entered the repair station in lap 44, failing to raise speed for the remaining eight, and finally Raikkonen finished fourth.
Hamilton said: "It's hard today because Wattley has been pretty good all weekend, and he gave me the position very gentlemanly.
The team achieved the first and second results, which were excellent."
The w limb language is very different.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked letters about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a speech at a rally in West Virginia, President Trump did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he commented that what was happening to the Senate right now proves how "devil, dirty and hypocritical" people are.
"One thing can happen when you see anger, and when you see angry, despicable, dirty, hypocritical people, and good things are happening in the Senate over the last few days."
"When you get to know the news releases and leaks, then they say, 'Oh, that's not what I did.
"That's not what I did."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you leaking the news?
Remember her answer... is the file you leaked - "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, please wait a little.
"Are we leaking...no, not us," he added, recalling the senator.
In July, Vanstein received a letter from Ford sent back detail describing the charges against Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September - but van Stan denied that her office led to the leak.
According to the Capitol Hill newspaper, Van Stan revealed to the committee that "I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations or leak her encounter."
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I kept it as she requested."
But her denial doesn't seem to have been accepted by the president, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: "Listen, body language is really bad."
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst limb language I've ever seen."
The president continues to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, saying Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
According to Mediaite, the president said: "They will surely regain power by any means necessary."
"You look at the despicable, dirty means that they don't care who hurts or who wrenches to gain power and control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 defeat Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two goals against Dundee to win the game for Giants
On Saturday, Dundee Stars won the game with 5-3 in the second round, making up for Friday's defeat to Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored a two-point lead for the Giants team at the start of the game.
Before Dwyer regained the lead for Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored home levels.
Before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals were won, Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's team lost in this season's elite league, and they beat Dundee with 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth time two teams met this season, and in three previous matches Giants won.
Dwyer started the opening battle with Kendall McFaull's assist in the fourth minute, while David Rutherford's assistance to Beauvillier doubled its lead after four minutes.
In the tense and busy opening battle, Sullivan gained a home edge at 13:10, followed by Matt Marquardt for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer scored the second goal that night at the end of the first game, making Giants lead in the first.
The main team reorganized the flag, Bouchard launched a strong offensive in 27 minutes and 37 seconds, again wringing the score.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second half of season 2, and scored their fifth goal at halfway through the final match, thus ensuring victory.
Giants has lost four in the last five games, and they will be battling Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers use life to ensure hundreds of passengers on board successfully escaped the quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller lost his life in order to ensure the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people, after which he was hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi triggered a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
Strong aftershocks continue to engulf the area, where many are trapped in ruins in Baru City.
But while colleagues are fleeing, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has not left his job and remains stuck in the crumbling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He insisted on staying there to ensure that Flight 6321, which was already on the runway at the time, took off safely.
When he realized that the control tower began to collapse, he jumped from the tower.
Then he died in the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News, Indonesian Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said this decision by Argonne saved hundreds of lives.
We have already prepared a helicopter taking off from the Baliboard in Kalimantan to send Argonne to major hospitals in other cities for treatment.
But, unfortunately, Argonne left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Barru.
"We are very saddened to hear this news," Silate added.
At the same time, Indonesia's national disaster reduction agency said roads to towns such as Dungala, Sigi and Boutong were blocked, with government authorities worrying that the death toll could reach thousands.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "We believe the death toll is still rising because many bodies are still buried beneath the ruins, and many have not yet been found."
A wave of up to six meters destroyed Baru, which would have held a collective funeral on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft are constantly delivering aids.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "The ambulance brings the body every minute."
Clean drinking water is scarce.
The nearby small market was looted."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the Indonesian International Red Cross (ICRC), told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its utmost to help survivors, but we don't know what searchers and rescuers will find.
While it's already a tragedy, the situation is likely to get worse."
According to CNN, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Baru on Sunday and delivered a speech to the Indonesian army: "I command you to complete all evacuation-related tasks day and night.
Are you ready?"
Indonesia's Lombok island was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia Aircraft Failure: Air Niugini Says Man Misses After Plane Falls on Atoll Lake
A New Guinea Airlines plane crashed into the atoll of Pacific Micronesia, which airlines previously said had 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated from planes sinking to the bottom of the lake.
New Guinea Airlines said at a Saturday afternoon launch that it was unable to explain the disappearance of male passengers.
The airline said it was working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to find the whereabouts of the missing men.
The airline did not immediately disclose the identity of the passenger's age, nationality and so on.
The plane crashed into the lake when it landed at Chuuk Island airport, after which local vessels took part in rescue and other passengers and crew were rescued.
On Friday, the official statement said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still being treated at the hospital and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the order in which things happened are unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft had landed off the runway in atoll lakes.
Some eyewitnesses believe the plane rushed off the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very lowly.
Jaynes said, "It's good to fly low."
Jaynes said that after the plane's sinking, the inside of the aircraft has been tucked deep and everyone walked to emergency exit.
He explained that the crew were terrified and shouted, and his head was slightly injured.
The U.S. Navy said sailors in the nearby converted terminals were involved in rescue, driving inflatable boats and bringing downers to shore, after which the plane sank in water about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in a plane crash registered by Papua New Guinea National Airlines over the past two decades, but there is no record of passenger deaths.
Analysts set a schedule for women who were burned alive in the evening
Prosecutors retrial on Saturday accused of burning a female suspect in Mississippi in 2014.
Attorney General Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, made hours of testimony as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he could use his phone record to piece together the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' activities on the night of the case.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rolett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tris was with him on the night of his death in Chanbos, which is contradictory to Tris' previous claims.
Tries said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, and data showed that Trips' phone was in the same position as Chambers's.
Sanford testified Saturday, saying he wasn't in town that day.
The prosecutor asked Sanford whether the situation was true when Teres claimed he had been on his truck in Sanford that night, and said Tris was "liaring because my truck was at Nashville."
Another paradox is that Tries said the two of them had known about two weeks after Chambers died.
Mobile phone records show they've just known for a week.
Rolett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Trieste removed text messages, telephone calls and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
Hale said, "He erased her from life and wiped her clean."
The defendants are scheduled to begin their final denunciation on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be sent to a jury later that day.
High Breed hip-hop combination: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop group wants to inject positive information into its own songs and change negative perceptions of hip-hop music.
The high Breed hip-hop combination comes from Bristol, where they say hip-hop music originally sings political content in songs to solve social problems but is now out of this form.
They want to trace their origins and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Hip-hop combinations such as The Fugees and Common have recently resurrected in Britain with the performances of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is he a black man again?
After receiving "racial discrimination" text messages fired, a nanny in New York sued the employer and couple to court
A New York babysitter was fired after mistakenly receiving text messages sent from a child's mother complaining about being "again black" and sued the couple to court for calling them "ethnic discrimination."
The couple refused to admit racial discrimination, calling the case "extortion".
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment after finding the other person black before child care provider Giselle Maurice took office.
"No~~~~~~~~~~"Another black man," he wrote in a text message to his husband Flaxman.
However, the textbook was misunderstood twice to Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing a state of dislocation, Mrs. Flaxman fired Maurice on the grounds that an African-American babysitter who was about to leave had not done well while she was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Flaxman paid Maurice a day's salary and then called the Uber to bring her home.
Maurice is suing the couple to pay up to $350 per day in compensation for a temporary six-month stay at the employer's home during this initial employment, although there are no contracts.
On Friday, Maurice told the New York Post reporter, "I want to tell them, look, you won't do that," adding: "I know this is racial discrimination."
The couple rebutted claims that they had no racial discrimination, saying termination of the employment of Maurice was a perfectly reasonable act and fearing being offended could not believe her later.
"My wife did not intend to send some information to her.
She has no racial discrimination.
"We are not racially discriminated against," husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But will you be reassured to give the child to someone who has ever offended himself, even if it is unintentional?"
You're just a child born?
"Please, probably no one will."
Plasco called the case "extortion," saying her wife had children two months ago and was currently "very difficult."
Will you hire someone like that?
"That's not a wise move," the investment banker added.
While the case is still pending, public opinion courts have quickly begun to denounce the couple's behavior and logic on social media.
The latest letter revealed that Paddington bear publishers feared readers could not accept a talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bornd, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by readers, said in a letter: "Before this book is published, it's hard for people to imagine how they feel about first-time readers.
Now the Paddington Bear has made a huge success, and it's really funny."
Speaking of his father, she said that her father was a photographer at the BBC and later inspired by a toy bear wrote this child's book, who had always been hopeful about his relentless work, adding that he died last year when the 60th anniversary of the book was described as "a bitter fragmentation."
Speaking of the Paddington Bear, she said it was "a very important part of our family," adding that her father was proud of his final success.
"My father is a very quiet man who never snarls himself," she said.
"But because the Paddington Bear is too real for him, it's like your kids have achieved something: you are proud of them, even though that achievement doesn't belong to you."
I think that's exactly how he sees the success of Paddington Bears.
Although it was the crystallization of his creation and imagination, he always attributed success to the Paddington Bear himself.
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was urgently sent to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice and eventually doctors could not save her life.
"Nad called as usual and said the situation was bad, she didn't expect to," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad, saying that my daughter had only a few minutes to go and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
I did it.
I said, "Dear Zasie, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will always be with you.
The medication that the doctor took to keep her heartbeat was gradually deficient.
She died prematurely and everything was over.
I know that all this has happened, and I can only sit there waiting.
I can't grow, scream or cry because my family and friends are all around me.
I have to be calm."
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was finally immersed in the grief of her widow, boarded the plane with other passengers and seemed calmly to forget the pain she was experiencing.
"Nobody can see it," she said.
"I lowered my head, and tears flowed unstoppable.
I know this is hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I had a strong sympathy for Nad.
He needs my understanding and caring.
I know how much he loves his daughter."
Sad women post cards to persuade those with light-hearted thoughts to turn their hearts back.
Two women who have lost their loved ones are trying to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on the Wales Bridge, with motivating letters written on the cards as well as phone numbers that facilitate support for people in need.
Lady Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want to have other parents experience the pain I suffer every day," she said.
Lady Davis lives at Lydney, age 45, and her son is an inexpensive cook whose face always hangs with a powerful smile.
"Everyone knows he's a laughing-loving man.
"People always say that his smile can make people full of the house happy."
But he gave up his job and soon died, and he went to "a particularly dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother was just 11 years old when he discovered Tyler ended his life.
Davis said: "I've always been worried that his suicide would have a concomitant response."
So Davis made a card, "Hopefully people know that someone is willing to help you and listen to your comments, even if we are friends."
"Don't be silent, you need to speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Lady Davies for many years, left herself shortly after her mother's death and now has 15 years of vision.
She said: "He never told us that he felt depressed or depressed.
Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that his emotions were not right.
On Christmas day, the children opened their gifts and he had nothing to do with eye contact when his emotions fell into the lowest valley."
She said that the death of her husband caused them a huge trauma, but they still have to continue living: "After his death, the heavens at home collapsed."
All of us are saddened.
"But we still have to continue living and fighting."

FBI investigates Brett Kavanaugh's future
"I think if we can really get what he wants - a survey that is limited in time and scope - then maybe we can restore a glimmer of solidarity," Flake said on Saturday, adding he was concerned that the committee would take this opportunity to "start breaking down" the deeply entrenched party stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to time problems.
Just five weeks from the midterm elections on November 6, and if Republicans are underperforming as we expected, their efforts to push U.S. Supreme Court candidates will be hit hard.
George W. Bush has been constantly calling the senators to try to lobby them for Kavanaugh's support, as Kavanaugh worked for the Bush administration at the White House and met through him his wife, Bush's private secretary Ashley.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
The Senate will be voting, with 51 Republican seats and 49 Democratic seats.
It's unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the line with Vice President Mike Pence, thus confirming the nomination of a Supreme Court candidate.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim Jong Un's regime "declines"
A lawmaker in South Korea said the number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has declined since Kim took office seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cites data from the Korea Unification Ministry, saying a total of 1,127 North Koreans defected to South Korea last year compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key reason for the decline in defectors is increased border controls between North Korea and China, as well as rising fees levied by people smuggling gangs.
North Korea did not make public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans who defected to South Korea were eventually granted citizenship.
South Korea says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors fled through China to North Korea, as the border with China is the longest and easier to cross than a heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, so it often forcibly repatriates them.
In recent months, the relationship between North Korea and South Korea has improved significantly, although technically still in a state of war.
Earlier this month, the two leaders held talks in Pyongyang to start a dialogue on stalled negotiations for denuclearization.
Improvements in the relations between the two countries have benefited from a historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, during which both sides generally agreed to work towards denuclearization on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Li Yonghao accused him of not making progress since the end of the meeting because the United States is still imposing sanctions.
"If the United States is not trustworthy, we will not be able to ensure that our country's security is guaranteed and therefore we are absolutely impossible to unilaterally disarm nuclear weapons," Li said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unsuitable to serve as a Supreme Court judge
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was "hysterical" and his temper was not suitable for office as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi interviewed the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't help but think that if a woman has this behavior, they will describe 'hysterics'," Pelosi said in response to the testimony delivered by Kavanaugh at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotionally out of control in response to a complaint from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed that he had not sexually assaulted Ford when he was younger.
Kavanaugh, in his opening speech, was emotionally out of control, almost crying several times when discussing his family and high school life, not even saying anything.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in attendance, saying the accusation was a "grotesque joint personal attack" organized by the Liberals because of their outrage at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony to prove he was incapable of serving the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was biased toward Democrats.
"I think his testimony, along with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrats, proves he's not qualified enough," she said.
When asked if Kavanaugh's conviction was finally confirmed and if the Democratic Party had a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected to impeaching Kavanaugh.
Pelosi said: "So if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI that it is not true, then he isn't just fit to serve in the Supreme Court but also undeserving of serving in a court now in office."
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh's possible negative ruling on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he belonged to conservative justices.
In confirming the hearing, Kavanaugh evaded his question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Now it's not suitable for a hysterical, prejudiced person to serve in the court and hopefully we will say 'Isn't that good?'" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their rights.
It was a slander of justice, and for months or even years the fury continued to spread, and she would not be able to get rid of it without crying out.
45 years later, Steinem said to me, "We'll cry when we get angry."
"I think it's normal, do you think?"
She continued, "A lady gave me a lot of help and she was the head of a company who said she would also cry when she was angry, but she found a trick to say to someone in conversation with her when she began to cry," you will know I'm sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
Then she went on.
I think it's pretty great."
We vent our anger with tears in part because we fundamentally misunderstood the tears.
One of the most impressive things I had was in my early years' work, a male-dominated company that once cried out for unspeakable anger, and then I was grabbed by an old woman (a negligent manager whom I have always been afraid of her) who dragged me into the stairs.
She warned me, "Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know you are angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy with it because they beat you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democratic Congresswoman, took part in the presidential campaign with Gary Hart.
In 1987, Hart withdrew from the campaign for an extramarital affair on a ship called "Monkey Business Dinner," and Schroeder was very frustrated that he should personally practice his idea of running for president.
"It's not a thoughtful decision," she said to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the campaign, and they didn't need another candidate.
It's called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was in the late stage of the campaign, Schroeder was more backward in raising funds, so she vowed not to participate in the campaign unless it raised $2 million.
This is certainly a undeniable battle.
She found that some supporters donated $1,000 to male campaigners but only gave her $250.
"Do they think I need discounts?" Schroeder suspected.
When she delivered a speech announcing that she would not launch an official campaign, she was plagued by various complex emotions - gratitude to supporters; disappointment in the institutions that made her difficult to raise money and targeting target voters rather than representatives; and anger at gender discrimination - she began to choke.
Schroeder, recalling the media's response to her, said: "You should think that my spirit has collapsed."
"You might think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I was thinking, what would they do on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
What China-US trade war will bring to Beijing
Professionals said the outbreak of the U.S.-China trade war was massive, and although the war had just begun, differences between the two countries could be more favorable for Beijing in the long run.
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump warned for the first time that it would be taxing China's major export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The trade war escalated sharply this week, with new tariffs taxing half of the U.S. goods entering China and affecting $200 billion (150 billion euros) worth of goods.
Beijing is retaliation in the same way every time, with the latest increase of 5% to 10% tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has committed to confronting the United States, and the world's second-largest economy will never retreat in the short term.
Making concessions to Washington means meeting their demands, but publicly surrendering to the United States is too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can do this handshake, then the pressure of the U.S. trade war could reduce the degree of interdependence between the two economies and bring long-term positive support to China.
Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher in the Asian field at the Center for New American Security think tank, said: "If Washington or Beijing make rapid political decisions, it could lead to economic turmoil between the two countries, which is actually more dangerous than previously recognized situations of disregard."
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Repatriate Refugees
Syria said it was ready for the refugees to return voluntarily, and called on all walks of life to help them rebuild their homes afflicted by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said at the UN General Assembly that conditions in Syria are improving.
"As progress has been made in the fight against terrorism, it is now becoming more stable and safer on the ground," he said.
The Syrian government will continue to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists and bring them back to normal.
At present, all conditions for the voluntary repatriation of refugees are ready and fleeing refugees are forced to leave their homes due to terrorism as well as unilateral economic measures against daily life and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people in Syria are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes other countries' assistance in rebuilding their devastated homes.
He stressed that it would not receive the assistance of conditional or supportive countries for insurgent activities.
Europe wins the Paris Ryder Cup
In the 2018 Ryder Cup competition at Le Golf National outside Paris, France, European teams beat the U.S. with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has lost six consecutive lands on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn first scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States, and Europe regained its title.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson struggled most of the game, and he recognized Francesco Molinari directly after his 16th hole, a third strike hit.
Italy's golfer, Molinari, has become one of four players who have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
U.S. player Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by Torbjorn Olesen, Denmark's lowest-ranked player in Europe.
World number one player, Dustin Johnson, 2-1 behind England's Ian Poulter, is expected to play his final Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, Spain, participated in eight Ryder Cups as a general who became the highest European winner in history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stand it today.
It's too hard this year.
Thank you so much for choosing me, believe me.
I'm glad to get the trophy back.
This is the glory of our entire team, and I am delighted to be able to do my part," Garcia excitedly introduced after winning a European match.
He delivered the torch to his compatriots, John Ram, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2-1 in Sunday's singles race.
"I've been watching Tiger Woods from childhood to age and can beat him, and I'm very proud," Ram said.
Woods lost four matches in France, with a record of 13-21-3 at this time, setting the Ryder Cup's lowest record.
For the greatest player of all time, this series of statistics is somewhat strange because he can be described as having won 14 important matches after Jack Nicklaus.
In addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau playing high-quality balls throughout the game, the U.S. team was not optimistic for the whole week.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk, after his team's disappointing performance, said: "I am proud of everyone who fights hard."
For some time this morning, we exerted a lot of pressure on Europe.
We're done.
Salute to Thomas.
He was very good as a captain.
The 12 players were excellent.
We're going to regroup and I'm going to join the U.S. PGA and Ryder Cup committees, and we're going to keep moving forward."
I love these 12 people and am honored to be their captains.
We must salute them.
We were defeated."

Admiral William Moran, the U.S. Navy's Deputy Warfare Secretary, said that even as the U.S. is revitalizing its forces to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States continues to expand the Asia-Pacific region - the Pentagon - to include the Indo-Asia-Pacific - as a naval focus.
According to the British "Jane Defense Weekly" website on September 24, the United States listed China and Russia as strategic competitors in its new defense strategy published earlier this year.
Since then, the U.S. Navy has reactivated its Second Fleet in order to fight more directly against Russia's activities.
These moves have raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts who fear that the U.S. Navy might be far away from a "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy that marks the Obama administration's landmark.
But Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy's focus remains on the Western Pacific.
On January 24, 2018 at a roundtable discussion entitled "Responding to the Challenges of the High Seas", hosted by the National Agency for Asian Studies in Washington, D.C., he said: "There has been no significant change for us."
"The focus remains on rebalancing, focusing or whatever you want to describe it."
However, he acknowledged that the United States has a close relationship with Europe.
"We will continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast and balance what we can do."
While Moran points out that the overall policy on Russia falls within the purview of the Secretary of Defense, he warns: "Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history proves they will be very tough if we clash with them."
Admiral Moran said the U.S. Navy is dynamically deploying its forces into a "new combat mode" as part of America's resurgence against Russia, China and other rivals, which will help to keep adversaries out of touch with where American aircraft carrier battle groups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and place.
"Our Marines and Marines support it - the concept of combat unpredictability, not to appear again and again in the same place, almost like a haircut - this is our practice."
The first attempt was the Hariri Truman aircraft carrier battle group, whose early deployment included working visits to ports and patrolling areas normally only through.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure allies know that these warships will still be patrolling in traditional areas and are also addressing logistical and family liaison issues for new deployment procedures.
Royal Navy commander Lieutenant-General Michael Nunan also spoke at the event, saying that Australian troops can work seamlessly with U.S. aircraft carrier combat groups.
He said the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to purchase nine more frigates equipped with the Zeus-Shield combat system.
A number of airlines have raised or resumed fuel surcharges since October 5, with flights scheduled to be added on Friday.
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiangpeng Aviation and Okai Airlines announced that since October 5, 2018 (the date of the ticket), domestic air routes fuel surcharge is under 800 km (including) each passenger receives $20 fuel surcharge on the following routes, and more than 800 km of flights are charged with $30 fuel surcharge per passenger.
Shuangpeng Airways, Okai Airlines and other companies announced that starting from the zero point (date of departure) on October 5, 2018, the charging rate for domestic fuel surcharges below 800 kilometers (including) increased from 10 yuan/person to 20 yuan/person, and the charging rate for gasoline surcharges in more than 800 kilometers of domestic routes rose from 10 yuan/person per passenger to 30 yuan/person.
Children, military and police malpractice is $10 per person; infants continue to be exempted from income.
According to the relevant Head of Carriage Tickets, the airline has indicated in the notification that the charge of fuel surcharge is based on the original date of ticketing, and when changing the ticket, the fuel surcharge will not be reimbursed.
This means that domestic passenger tickets issued before October 5, if they are to be changed after October 5 (including), do not pay fuel surcharges according to the new standard.
Since June 5, 2018, several airlines such as National Airways, Eastern Airways, Maritime Airways, Shanghai Airways, Spring and autumn Airways, Shenzhen Airways, Western Airways, Okay Aviation have resumed charging for fuel surcharges on domestic routes that have been cancelled for three years to the standard of $10 per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Aviation and Okai Airlines first announced the increase in fuel surcharges, as of the reporter's draft, have not yet seen the news of the domestic four major airlines declaring follow-up to the adjustment.
It is also understood that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Service stipulates that airlines can decide whether to charge fuel surcharges on their own in November.
Cathay Pacific Airlines first announced on September 27 that it will recycle fuel surcharges from November 2.
The Cathay Pacific website shows that all airline tickets issued or reissued on or after November 2 will include fuel surcharges for long-haul flights to Hong Kong and the Southwest Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa with a fuel surcharge of $652 and a short-haul flight fee of $146.

Japan's Yidong Commercial Bank on Friday acknowledged a $1.3 billion depreciation loss in its investment in China's Sino-Cindian shares, which was offset by trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, in Tokyo, Japan, a man walked through the headquarters of Till Red Company.
He said the trade war slammed China's grain sector, which has suspended financial transactions in agriculture.
A number of Japanese heavy-duty equipment manufacturers, telecommunications companies and others have warned about the impact of trade frictions between China and the United States when they announced their latest results.
The United States and China impose tariffs on each other's hundreds of billions of dollars in goods, and President Trump threatens that if the dispute is not resolved, it will extend the tax to all more than $500 billion for Chinese goods.
Tsuioshi Hachimura, Ito's business finance chief, said the trade dispute could have a bigger impact on China's economy next year.
In 2015, Ito Guangdong Commercial and Thai BBC Group invested $10 billion in Sino-Sin, acquiring its 20% stake.
Hachimura claims that Ito's business company has claimed 143.3 billion yen ($1.3 billion) of losses on this part of the holding, because it believes that the value of CMC shares will not return in the near future.
Ito Yong Business maintains a profit forecast for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2019 at 500 billion yen.
China imposed a 25% import tariff on soybeans in July to counter Washington's moves in trade friction.
"Our cereal business has been hit by trade frictions between the United States and China," said Ianhong, Chief Financial Officer.
He said Kaohhong has stopped financial transactions in its own accounts since September.
Gaohong spokesman Pat Burke said in his statement on Friday that the company's move was "under internal policy constraints and due to a lack of market opportunities."
He also said a moratorium on financial transactions would not lead to fewer jobs.
The annual profit forecast for 230 billion yen is unchanged, supported by pulp and papermaking as well as power generation operations.

On November 5, a comprehensive report said that the U.S. midterm election vote was in retrospect.
On November 4, President Trump and Democratic opponents actively "call out" their core voters.
Both major parties pointed out that voter turnout will be key to the right-wing choice.
For 48 hours before the U.S. popular vote, Trump was busy attending a rallying occasion for Republican candidates, and former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand up for Joe Donnelly, a Democratic Federal Senate candidate who is in high urgency, and shouted out his final demands ahead of the election.
On November 4, Trump went to Mayang, Georgia, for the Republican governor's candidacy Brian Kemp, where he said: "You have to go to a polling station on Tuesday and you have to vote."
"The contrast between this election is not clearer."
Voters' political enthusiasm has risen to a rare peak, with some states voting ahead of schedule far more than usual.
Former U.S. presidents face the first midterm elections, and his party's congressional seats tend to decrease.
According to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on Thursday, while Democrats' federal Household elections remain strong, Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump's strict concerns about border security.
Polls show that registered voters prefer Democratic House candidates more than Republicans, with a ratio of 50% to 43%, but still declined by 14 percentage points ahead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and The Wall Street Journal also showed Democrats are still seven points ahead of Republicans.
Obama told the crowd at Senator Donnelly's helm: "When people don't tell the truth, when words no longer represent anything, there will inevitably be evil consequences."
When people can only slander themselves and lie, democracy cannot work."
"The only way to stop these Republicans now is you and your votes."
Democrats are facing the toughest election in decades for the Senate, with more than half of the Republicans currently holding 51 seats.
But the House elections are more favorable, and Democrats need to win another 23 seats to take control of the House with 435 seats.
Analysts at FiveThirtyEight.com predict that Democrats are likely to win the House of Representatives by as much as 85%.

Wang Yang pointed out that since the 18th Congress of the Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping has put forward a series of new ideas and opinions on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference. For the first time, he proposed that the People's Political Consultative Conference is an important channel for socialist consultation and democracy and a specialized consultative body, which is an important part of the national governance system, is an institutional arrangement with Chinese characteristics, for the first time clarifying the characteristics and advantages of the new political party system, emphasizing the correct handling of the relationship between consistency and diversity, deeply revealing the true meaning of people's democracy lies in good business, people's affairs are discussed by everyone, reveals the logical link between "China's management" and China's political system, condensed with deep theoretical thinking about upholding Good and Developing Good People's Political Consultative System, is the latest result of the Party's theory of popular political Consultative Conference.
Wang Yang stressed that the CPP at all levels should use theoretical learning and research as an opportunity to further identify the weaknesses and shortcomings in the work of the CPP, and strive for breakthroughs in strengthening and improving.
It is necessary to comprehensively strengthen the construction of the party system of the CPC and ensure that the decision-making deployment of the Party's central committee is not impeccable in the work of the CPC.

People's Network Beijing November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) under the current wave of "popular start-ups, many innovation", more and more technology companies began to pay attention to patent research and development and related protection work, deep into the potential value of patents, occupy market dominance.
Similarly, there are a number of technology enterprises in the field of patent and technical licensing, use of patented technologies and other aspects have experienced no small wave of infringement.
At the end of 2017, three people from Guangdong province Tan Wei, Hohanghong and Libin on the grounds of patent infringement, filed a lawsuit against Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court by Beijing Xiao Orange Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiao Orange Technology), operator Digit Transportation Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Dit Transit), salesman Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Service Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific).
The three plaintiffs requested a court order that the three defendants immediately stop making, selling, promising sales and using the plaintiff's patent.
On October 30, 2018, China's judicial instrumentation network published "the first-instance civil ruling of Tan Wei, Hehanghong and Beijing Xiaoxing Technology Co., Ltd. in violation of invention patent rights disputes", disclosed the details of some cases where DDT travel applications were accused of patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that the patentee and inventor of the "mobile terminal-based carpool service system and method" patent, while the entire operating process of the "wind truck" application in the "Drip Drip Travel" app corresponds to the technical program related to patent protection, constitutes a patent infringement.
However, during the court ruling, Xiao Orange Technology believes that Guangdong Pacific is not a suitable defendant, it only provides free download of APP "Drip Drip Travel" on the network, did not implement the patent method involved, there are no direct or indirect infringements, should not be listed as an accused in this case.
Secondly, the violation of this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent in question should be a place for full implementation of the patented method involved, and therefore objected to the jurisdiction of the court, requesting that this case be transferred to the Court of Residency of the Defendant, i.e. Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court believes that the defendant Guangdong Pacific has provided APP products on its network platform, and it is not advisable for the plaintiff to include the defendant Guangdong Pacific as an accused.
And the defendant's abode in Guangdong Pacific is located in Guangzhou City, under the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant Xiao Orange Technology argued that the case should be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial, on insufficient grounds, dismissed the defendant Xiao Orange Technology Co., Ltd.'s objection to the jurisdiction of this case and assumed the costs of admissibility of the case against jurisdiction.
At present, other trials in the case have not been announced, and journalists will also closely follow the subsequent details of patent infringement cases.
Interview with CEO of Australia's Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization: Significant Results in Australian-Chinese Science and Technology Cooperation
"China's science and technology has been developing rapidly over the past few decades, and both countries can achieve fruitful results in scientific fields together."
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Australian Federal Science and Industrial Research Organization, said in an interview with CNN reporters in Beijing that cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology from addressing climate change to "sightseeing" projects has demonstrated a strong momentum.
As Australia's largest national-level research institution, CSIRO has achieved many world-renowned innovations in marine, energy, biology, materials, and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a long-lasting friendship that encompasses the tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with our partners," Marshall said.
In May this year, China's 500-meter spherical radio telescope - "China Sky Eye" installed the first international 19 beam L band receiver.
The 19-bit feed source receiver is currently the most advanced in the world, jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of receivers is based on CSIRO's multi-year technical accumulation, and after its inception, FAST cruise speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, while also expanding more scientific observation goals.
"This is a part of CSIRO's contribution to FAST."
In addition to the above cooperation, CSIRO has been working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in building square kilometers of array radio telescopes, developing new fuel technologies, and saving energy and reducing emissions.
"Previous scientific research often focuses on problems hundreds of years later, and there is a need for more scientific power to solve the problems that lie ahead."
Marshall believes that the two countries are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a number of challenges in their development.
For example, extreme weather is frequenting the world, droughts and floods have led to food production cuts, and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same time, problems such as population explosions, ageing and chronic diseases are also currently facing serious challenges.
"The cooperation between the two countries in recent years is mainly aimed at resolving these current problems."
Marshall said that the International Centre for Southern Hemisphere Ocean Research Center, co-founded by CSIRO and Qingdao National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology, focuses on observing El Nino and La Nina phenomena, studying the relationship between them and extreme weather, and setting up early warning facilities for extreme weather; new varieties of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to overcome extreme weather can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, scientific and technological innovation is difficult to complete alone, requires very high costs, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today."
Marshall said that the closer cooperation, the more likely it will be to achieve breakthrough progress, which is also the meaning of strengthening cooperation between the two countries under the "Belt and Road" framework.
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation is primarily for us in the field of science and technology."
Marshall, for example, CSIRO recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find a method of purifying less environmentally polluted gold.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology into China, which is one of the results of our participation in the Belt and Road cooperation."

Foreign Minister Li Yonghao told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States, which could not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Li Yonghao said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken a "very friendly approach" over the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, demolishing nuclear testing sites, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we didn't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security if we do not trust the United States, and under such circumstances we cannot unilaterally give up arms."
While Li is repeating North Korea's complaints about the U.S. opposition to "phased" denuclearization, his remarks are significant because there is no complete rejection of unilateral denuclearization as it was before.
Li Yonghao referred to Kim Jong-un and Trump's joint statement on June 12, when Kim agreed to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says it must give up nuclear weapons first.
The U.S. has also refused to relax its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the sanctions pressure to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, even refusing to issue a declaration of an end to war," Li said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees for forgiveness is not to understand the people who are making daydreams."
But the problem is that such persistent sanctions are deepening our distrust."
Li Yonghao did not mention the plan for a second special-purpose meeting that the president of the United States mentioned earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, he highlighted three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying: "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea rather than North Korea, then denuclearization on the Korean peninsula will not become so rigid."
China has announced that it will reduce import duties for 1,585 tax purposes since November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has repeatedly taken the initiative to reduce import duties.
On 1 May this year, the total tax reduction of medicines was made to zero for all common drugs including anti-cancer drugs and bio alkaline drugs with anti-cancer effects, and actual imported Medicinal Drugs.
At the same time, it has also significantly reduced the value-added tax and duties of anti-cancer drugs production and import links.
On July 1, the car and parts for 218 purposes were taxed.
After the tax reduction, China's overall car tax rate has fallen below the average level in developing countries and corresponds to the actual Chinese auto industry.
This tax reduction will drive the industry's structural adjustment and resource optimization configuration, accelerate the survival of the fittest, help improve the quality of products and services, and is expected to promote a certain degree of car price adjustment, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, the tax was reduced to 1,449 consumer goods for daily purposes.
Tax reductions in daily consumer goods are closely related to the needs of people for a better life.
This tax reduction is not only large but also intense, with an average tax reduction rate of 56%.
Tax reductions on daily consumer goods directly benefit the majority of consumers, and promote domestic industries to improve competitiveness.
On November 1, a tax reduction will be imposed on industrial goods such as electromechanical equipment, parts and raw materials for 1585 purposes.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some of the much-needed industrial goods in China can attract more foreign investment, which is conducive to increasing domestic effective supply, and helps industry upgrading, while also helping enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs, and also contributes to reducing the pressure borne by the domestic environment.
The relevant head of the Office of the Committee on Tariff Taxes of the State Council of China said that the above four self-imposed tax reductions, as well as the third step in the implementation of the results of the negotiations under the information technology agreement on July 1 this year, will reduce the total tariff level of China from 9.8% to 7.5% last year.
The adjusted total tariff level is slightly higher than the EU, below most developing countries, at a moderately low level and basically matches the status and development stage of China's developing countries.
The head of the company said that as one of the important indicators of openness in China's goods trade, the total level of tariffs should be aligned with the stage of economic development in China and reflect the characteristics of the era.
China's trade in goods is the world's largest, has already had a further expansion of open economic base, but there are still gaps in the quality and effectiveness of trade development compared to developed economies, so that the total level of tariffs should be appropriately reduced.
Tariffs are a means of compliance protection, the level of tariffs should be compatible with industrial competitiveness, to encourage virtuous competition, excessive protection is not conducive to industrial development and improve quality.
Tariff tariff adjustment should take into account both production and consumption needs.
The main focus is to reduce the high domestic demand and contribute to industrial transformation and upgrading of commodity tax rates, strive to increase the import of characteristic advantageous products that are more concentrated in the needs of the people's population, continue to enhance the sense of enterprise and public access, meet the upgrade needs of industrial structure and consumer structure.
Tax reduction efforts must balance fiscal income and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax reduction goods and tariff reductions, it is necessary to integrate and coordinate the two domestic and foreign markets, upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relations, and maintain a stable and good development momentum in China's economy.

Serbia declares highest state of readiness and the president of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
South Commune quoted the Serbian presidential office as saying that in view of the Kosovo Special Forces occupying a watershed lake at the Ghazivoda hydropower station controlled by Belgrade in northern Kosovo, President Vuccic ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest level of combat readiness.
On 29 September, the Minister of Defense of Serbia Wulin declared that the Serbian army had entered a full-fledged state of readiness.
Mr. Wulin stressed that as long as the order issued by Mr. Mukhic remains in effect, Serbia will continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo and responds to any direction of the incident.
According to the Russian Tas News Agency, on September 29, Vucic said in an interview that he has already informed about the current situation with other parties such as the United States, Russia and Europe, and will travel to Moscow on October 2 to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked if Serbia needs Russian military support like Syria, Vucic responded negatively: "I don't want a major military conflict on our territory."
Mr. Vucic also said that the entry into full-fledged combat readiness of the Serbian army was only intended to form a deterrent to prevent the conflict, but it was also a clear warning: no violence in Kosovo would ever be tolerated.
The increase in the readiness of the Serbian army is related to two major moves on the Kosovo side.
According to the Serbian side, recently Albanians have been blatantly arresting generations of Serbs living in the area in northern Kosovo and these arrested Serbs have not violated any law.
Mr. Vucic said that since Marco Yulic, head of the Serbian government's office in Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and seized by the Kosovo Albanian army on 26 March this year, there has been an uninhumane arrest and expulsion of Serbs in the region where ethnic Albanians have been subjected to violence against them.
In addition, more than 100 people, including the ROSU Special Forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, which had recently been self-proclaimed, occupied positions near the water supply lake at the Ghazivoda hydropower station, entered ecological and sports centres near the dam in the northern part of the region and blocked all roads nearby, which were controlled by the Serbian side.
Mr. Vuchic noted that this military adventurous action in Kosovo was carried out at the encouragement of Western countries and that the actions of the Kosovo army had not been previously informed by the Serbian side, a violation of Chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement as well as an agreement between the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and Seko.
Wuczic has shouted to NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, criticizing Western countries' hypocrisy on the Kosovo issue.
The root causes of this conflict are still centuries-old grievances between the Serb and Cypriot communities in the Kosovo region.
Regarding Kosovo &apos; s ownership, the Serbs and Albanians differed from one another.
Serbia sees Kosovo as a national buoyant and cultural cradle, since Serbia established its most powerful country here in the 12th century, while the Albanians only migrated extensively after the Ottoman invasion and defeat of the Serbian army to the north.
The Albanians, for their part, maintained that the original tribal Illyrians living in Kosovo in the 4th to 5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Albanians and therefore since ancient times it has been the territory of the Albanians.
Subjective political division has led to intense ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts that have resulted in fierce antagonism between Serbs and Albanians in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovo Albanians first declared independence for Albania.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living in the Balkans migrated to Turkey, and the proportion of Serbs rose relatively. In Serbian opinion, the practice of "only taking back their own land" was seen by the Albanians as a pillage of "great Serbianism", which provoked bicommunal conflict.
Kosovo became the Balkans' "poison drum."
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian army and police led to a bombardment by NATO forces of the South African Union composed of Serbia and Montenegro.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia.
Since then, despite the news that Serbia will normalize its relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it has not been possible to conclude agreements dominated by multiple forces such as the United States, Europe and Russia due to historical national grievances and geopolitical constraints.
Just a month ago, for the first time, Vucic explicitly advocated segregation of Serbs in Kosovo from Albanians and renewed openness to bicommunal contradictions.
Electricity communications are still disrupted due to earthquakes in Indonesia with tsunami relief difficulties
According to figures released by the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency in the early hours of March 30, a strong earthquake and tsunami that erupted in Donggala County, Central Sulawesi province, have killed 420 people.
VilemRampangilei, the head of Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said the figure was only a preliminary estimate of the city of Palu, central Sulawesi province, about 80 kilometers from the earthquake, due to the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many of the city's densely built hotels, shopping malls, warehouses and other people destroyed by the earthquake have not yet been recovered.
Local time on September 29, 2018, the Indonesian road, a bridge destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis collapsed into several sections.
Due to the severe damage caused by electricity and communications facilities, the earthquake in Donggala County and neighboring Sigi district are still unconnected "lonely islands", which can not be counted.
Indonesia's vice president, Kara, said the number of dead or thousands.
Electrical interruptions, communication disruptions, road blockages, damage to airports... Relief work after the earthquake and tsunami is difficult.
Due to power outages, some hospitals and rescue settlements in the city of Palu depend on fuel for electricity generation.
The road to and from the city was blocked by landslides, and large transport vehicles including tankers were inaccessible, making fuel supply very tight.
Indonesia's Minister of Social Affairs Agus said emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothing, food and household goods packages were not yet delivered to the affected areas due to road damage.
Disaster relief shipments from the capital Jakarta are being transported to the affected areas by air transport aircraft.
In view of the damage caused by the earthquake to the Palau airport command post and runway, in order to ensure safety and security for rescue, all commercial flights have been suspended with only military aircraft carrying relief supplies and personnel.
Viranto, Indonesia's integrated minister of political, legal and security affairs who commands the rescue in the earthquake zone, has called for the restoration of power supply and commercial airport flight services as soon as possible to ensure the operation of relief agencies such as hospitals so that more rescue workers and volunteers can reach the disaster zone.
On 28th, a number of strong earthquakes took place in Donggala County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, where the magnitude 7.7 earthquake at 17:02 local time triggered a tsunami that caused major disasters in Palu City, Donggala County and Shiji District.
China Xinxin Beijing October 1 (Journalist Yin Li) is empty, clear and full of sunshine...... Recently, Beijing has continued to open the most beautiful blue sky mode, bringing thousands of people in Beijing on social platforms flowering pictures, showing happiness in the continuous brush screen, saying "under the blue sky and white clouds, 'drunk' beauty skyline, this is Beijing's best business card."
Since August, Beijing has ushered in the "Bluest Sky".
In the city of Beijing, people can be seen at any time or anywhere with their smartphones or single-handed cameras.
Weibo, WeChat friends circle and other social platforms, everywhere you can see the home, Tiananmen, bird nest, huong...... Various buildings show different beauty under the blue sky screen.
Some netizens said that such a "big picture" is Beijing's best urban propaganda film; and other netizens joked that if such blue sky brush screen for a long time, people with cervical vertebrae disease can be cured; more netizens hope that "this blizzard will make the winter of spring and summer brighter, so that the heavenly shadow of Beijing would be brilliant."
Why do people in Beijing love the sunshine?
Only because the people who lived in this city in the past were suffering from smog, which led to a special desire for blue sky, and after Beijing's "blue sky defense war", continuous improvement of air quality, smog less, blue sky more, people see in their eyes happy in heart, obtained happiness is also an extraordinary contribution.
On the day of National Day, Beijing's weather is clear.
At 8:00 a.m., most of the city's 35 air quality monitoring stations were shown as "first-level" green.
The social platform's spontaneous "Bluest Sky" theme photography contest is still ongoing.
Why is Beijing so blue recently?
According to the relevant head of the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, in August this year, Beijing's average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter, making it the best record for the same period in nearly five years.
In September, the real-time concentration of PM2.5 was more frequented.
The emergence of the "blueest skies" is a major factor in recent meteorological conditions are generally favorable, and more importantly, Beijing has consistently carried out air pollution management, vigorously promoted clean air action plans for nearly five years, environmental benefits continue to release, resulting in reduced total pollutants emissions in the region, which have laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.
Beijing officially promulgated and implemented the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan for 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, the official continues to guide non-capital functional deflation, promote energy cleanification replacement and pollution reduction work, total elimination of coal-fired boilers 4923.
Beijing has thus become the first major city in China to achieve full-scale natural gasization.
Data show that between 2013 and 2017, Beijing's average annual PM2.5 concentration cumulatively decreased by 35.6%; the number of air quality days to meet standards increased by 50 days; the number of first-tier best days increased by 25 days; the number of heavy pollution days reduced by a total of 35 days, and the incidence of heavy pollution was significantly reduced.
At the same time as air quality continues to improve, according to the new round of PM2.5 source analysis, Beijing officially released the three-year plan of action for Beijing City to win blue sky defense in September this year, focusing on diesel vans, dusting, volatile organic matter management and other key areas of control, optimize adjustment of transport structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land use structure, strengthen regional protection and control, focus on strengthening urban fine-tuning management, comprehensively promote green development, strive to make "the bluest skies" stay in Beijing city, no longer "expensive", let it return to people's photo album background rather than protagonist.
During this year's national holiday golden week, the relevant departments of the city tourism commission, business, urban management, public security and other departments will strengthen law enforcement checks on the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the tourist "six black" turmoil, illegal offenders once verified, will be subjected to severe superstition punishment according to law.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a seminar to strictly crack down on illegal "one-day tours" and deployed special actions to further crack down on illegal "one-day tours".
The meeting revealed that the "six black" turmoil linking the interests chain of black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, and black nets has intertwined in the city since July 28 to start a special action to crack down on illegal "one day tour".
Specific actions have been carried out so far, the whole city has received 39 "one day tour" complaints, down 63% year-on-year; since this year, the entire city has accepted 270 "one day tour" complaints, down 62% year-on-year.
In recent two months, the whole city has seized 248 "black cars", investigated 158 violations of tourist and passenger business, closed shopping "black shops" and entertainment venues 29, found 13 "black clubs" and 27 "black conductors", confiscated 26,000 illegal advertisements, dismantled 31 pieces of illegal "one day tour" billboards and 3 blocks of public transit holiday station cards, investigated all kinds of travel offenses 1789, various functional departments have filed 181 cases, from a heavy fine of 4.48 million yuan, detained 111 people who were involved in traveling crimes.
After the rectification, illegal "one day tour" chaos was basically curbed, and the "one day tour" market order appeared to be stable and good.
In recent years, the city has continuously increased its crackdown on illegal "one-day tours".
In 2016 and 2017, the city tourism commission received "one day tour" complaints of 1,612 and 897 cases, which decreased by 79% and 44% respectively year-on-year, but illegal "one day tour" continues to be repeated and often rebounded, and formed a cross-cutting "six black" chaos in the interests chain such as black tickets, black guides, black company, black car, black shop, black net.
In particular, the illegal pickup of passengers on the street is "black ticket", an illegal website that publishes false tourist information - "black net", a travel agency or non-travel agency operating qualifications institution or individual (the "black company") engaged in illegal "one day" tour, no guide license or irregular practice guided tour guide hired by "black company", its use of untourist passenger qualifications vehicles or tourism passenger qualifications to provide passenger services for illegal "one day" trip, and eventually they bring tourists into the designated tourist shopping store called "black shop".

Among them, "black car" and "black shop" became the two toughest priorities in special operations.
According to the report, without black cars, illegal "one-day tour" can not be carried out, black cars are both easy to find, remember and detect, but also a single value of fixed assets.
The relevant departments use road traffic surveillance probes to increase the supervision of key "one-day tour" routes for tourist buses, with technical and physical defense and other scientific and technological intelligent means can find a timely detection of "black cars".
Tourism shopping "black shop" due to the small number, sit-in operation, also became a strict focus.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and crackdown on illegal "one-day tour", in every special action, if any violations are found, each functional department shall be severely superseded by law.
In August this year, the city also held a seminar on legal issues related to toughening illegal "one-day tour" and discussed means and measures for combining administrative penalties with convictions.
The city tourism commission said that in the future, more regular travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing's "one-day tour" and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" so as to further excavate the living space of illegal "one-day tour", which is currently being studied.
In addition, the city tourism commission has continuously improved the e-ticket information system of tourist missions to ensure that each team is included in the supervision of e-ticket platform.

Active treatment, China's survival rate of preterm births for 29 weeks or more has reached the level of developed countries.
30 September (Chen Jing Lu Yanqiang) The National Center for Children's Medicine and the Pediatric Hospital attached to Fudan University revealed on the 30th that it introduced Canada's advanced methods in the prestigious "China NICU hospitalization of preterm birth quality improvement project".
Results of the project show that after positive treatment, China's 29 weeks or more preterm child survival rate reached 98%, has reached the level of developed countries, but there is still a large improvement in the survival rate of premature children with minimal foetal age and uncomplicated births.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been focusing on neonatal care.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai fell to 3.71%, which is significantly below the national average and reaches the advanced level of developed countries.
"China's NICU hospitalized preterm birth quality improvement project" through four years of unremitting efforts, has greatly improved the survival quality of premature babies.
Professor Cao Yun, director of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Fudan University's Pediatric Hospital affiliated with Fengtian University, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, attention is paid to reducing the quality of preterm child survival, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the prognosis of neurodevelopment, improving the overall outcome of children, which is important for improving the overall survival quality and population quality of premature babies, is an important concern in the pediatric and neonatal communities within China and abroad, as well as a key issue of this project.
"China's NICU hospitalized premature birth quality improvement project" through four years of unremitting efforts to include tens of thousands of preterm births in the country for 33 weeks and below, resulting in a 1/3 reduction in domestic childbirth age and infant birth weight mortality, while the incidence of serious complications of preterm birth is significantly reduced, greatly improving the survival quality of preterm children.
Through the establishment of a national network for improving quality of newborns, introduction of collaborative quality improvement concept, radiated all over China's 25 collaborating hospitals, and established a set of cooperative methods that are suitable for domestic conditions to improve the prognosis of preterm births, improve the level of neonatal care complete, systematic and effective cooperation quality improvement method.
The Fudan University affiliated pediatric hospital is working with the National Neonatal Forces to develop guidelines for treatment of neonatal infections in accordance with the project, providing reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
It is understood that in the "China Prematuration Quality Improvement Project", pediatric hospitals introduced the EPIQ method to 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces throughout the country, and are committed to addressing the problem of preterm birth infections that plague China's neonatal care rooms.
After more than 10 years of continuous improvement, Canada's national survival rate for preterm births without complications increased by about one-third, and Canada is now one of the best countries in the world for preterm births.
The EPIQ method is now applied to all of Canada's national NICUs and has been adopted by six countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the results showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, premature birth infections fell by 35%, while antibiotic use declined by 20%.
In the future, Fudan University affiliated pediatric hospital will continue to promote and implement this approach nationwide, with a view to comprehensively reducing all complications of preterm births and improving the quality of care for newborns throughout the country.
At present, there is an indisputable fact that the level of medical care in various regions of China has been different and uneven.

The Day of Remembrance is resurrected, and more so wakes up.
To open up the heavy history, behind each martyr's name is a living life.
They also have hot youth, sincere love, and entangled families.
However, because they firmly believe that "theism of our faith is the truth of the universe" in order to "exempt the sufferings of the next generation," they are willing to sacrifice everything for themselves.
"One day I'm going to be crying for China."
Through time and space, the Angels set up a spiritual roadmap that guides the way forward.
"Where to come from, where to go", "what kind of person to be," read Yield, it is not difficult to get an answer.

For various reasons, many primates did not even leave their names.
Innumerable spirits pour ideals with blood, practice faith through life, remember their English name, and pass on their spirit, is the root and soul of the nation.
This "hero monument" is not tolerated for any damage or destruction.
For a while, historical nihilism and over-the-counter entertainment have flown.
Various practices that distort history, derogate from the spirit, challenge justice conscience, misunderstand value judgments, and cause outrage and vigilance in society as a whole.
The hero can't forget the blasphemy.
For the act of touching the bottom line, you can not listen to it, must dare to brighten the sword, with the rule of law and justice in defense of good dignity.
On May 1st, the Hero Martyrs Protection Act was formally enacted.
From the point of view of judicial practice, some judgments in cases are very fast people, both to effectively maintain the image of radiance and glory according to law, and to release the positive energy that is admiring heroes and admirers.
A chasing nation cannot be without a hero, and an ideal country cannot be without a pioneer.
Remembrance of pioneers and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are millions of memorial facilities throughout the country, and more than a million people visit the martyrs' gardens every year.
The heart of man is the most solid foundation.
Let the cherished heroes, defending heroes, learning heroes, and caring for heroes take a fresh turn, let the spirit of enthusiasm integrate into the national bloodstream, a "hero monument" will firmly stand between heaven and earth, deep in people's hearts.
Reuters Brussels, Sept. 28 - After Italy's contempt for EU demands and surprise the market with a massive budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational position against Italy on Friday, but if Italy sticks to too bold targets, the EU might take a more aggressive stand.
Italy's skeptical European government goal is to have a budget deficit equivalent to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next three years, indicating that there are still no debt cuts just under cut demands.
Moskovisi, the European Commission's Executive Committee for Economic Affairs, said on Friday that "we have no interest in the crisis between the commission and Italy," taking a cautious response as EU recommendations and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that before Italy formally presents it to the Executive Committee in mid-October, market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budget plans.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday and Italy's bond yield hit its highest for three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the European Commission may veto Italy's draft budget, something that the commission has never done to any country.
The European Commission's vice president, Dong Blosky, later said at a meeting in Riga, Latvia, that Italy's current fiscal plan "appears to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Pact," referring to the EU's financial regulations.
But he didn't say what that would trigger the EU response.
The bidders may submit an application for participation in the open tender by 26 October this year.

Experts from the national film-free cotton field observation and discussion exchange activities walked into the test fields, listening to representatives of the team of Chinese engineering institutes.
China Xinxin Xinjiang Shaya September 30, 2019 (Gengdan Dan Wang Xiaojun) is located in the testing base of membrane-free cotton cultivation in Xinjiang Shaya County, with a "no inferiority" compared to the next layered cotton, a cluster of white cotton competing for "opening", hanging full of branches.
On September 27-28, the national field observation and discussion exchange event was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
The reporter learned at the observation conference that the "Chinese cotton 619" and its accompanying cultivation measures as the main system of membraneless cotton technology, initially achieved the goal of non-membracing cultivation of cotton fields, reduced the pollution of the ecological environment and raw cotton in Xinjiang.
The chief scientist of China's engineering academy, famous cotton genetic breeder, and the country's modern agri-industry technology system (the cotton system) has given Zhou State Model to the Party Committee Secretariat of Zhejiang Agrarian and Forestry School about the growth of non-membrane cotton.
"Our integrated membrane-free cotton technology can completely achieve the cultivation of cotton without flooring, it can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and achieve green planting cotton."
Introducing the Chinese Academy of Engineering's Fellowship.
Xinjiang is China's most important cotton production area, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 there were 35 million acres of cotton grown in Xinjiang, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton.
Since the introduction of earth film in China in 1982, all kinds of crop coatings in Xinjiang area have reached more than 50 million acres, and the annual use of Earth film is about 300,000 tons.
Among them, cotton floor covering reached 100%, cotton field coating accounted for about 60% of the use of land membranes in Xinjiang.
The production of membraneless cotton is measured, and the yield of cotton can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg.
With the continuous increase in the amount of land membrane investment in Xinjiang, low recovery rate of residual earth membranes, gradual increase in the number of debris in soil, and a series of problems such as damage to soil structure, seriously affect agricultural sustainable development.
Removal membranes not only cause serious pollution to the soil, but also have a great impact on the quality of cotton fibers.
At present, more than 1/3 of Xinjiang's cotton fields have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, the area of cotton harvesting in Xinjiang was about 14 million acres.
The cotton harvesting process yields a large amount of surface, the crushing membrane on the cotton plant, and the crushing membrane in the original cotton is difficult to remove during raw cotton processing, nor can it be completely removed during subsequent textile processing, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the national field observation and discussion exchange event was held in Xinjiang Shaya County.
In order to focus on solving cotton field membrane pollution, simplifying the planting of cotton technology and improving the efficiency of cotton fields, he led his team through eight years, implementing "Chinese cotton 619" non-membrane cotton technology cultivation, for the green development of Xinjiang's agriculture.
Introduction, through innovative breeding new ideas, the cultivation of early-ripe, salinate, low temperature and rich land cotton new product line "Chinese cotton 619".
"In the conditions of non-membrane cultivation in the southern region of Xinjiang, a series of supporting measures such as membraneless planting machinery, seeding depth improvement, dripping belt submerged under membraneless conditions, suitable sewing density screening, reasonable chemical regulation."
At present, Aksu, Kurle and Aral have established a non-membrane cotton demonstration base, producing 4,800 kg per hectare.
No membrane cultivation of cotton, achieved rich production, baking, environmental protection, and improved comprehensive benefits.
Zhang Donghai, agro-artist of the 3rd Division Agronomic Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of research and demonstration of membraneless cotton cultivation technology, the production of membraneless cotton seeded cotton can be fully achieved by yielding 320 kg to 350 kg, or even possibly higher.
"The prospects for the promotion of membrane-free cotton cultivation technology are great."
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, membrane-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is still a certain gap in economic efficiency compared to flooring cultivation.
"The support for cotton acquisition prices will be conducive to future promotion."
Fujitsu said that next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research on membraneless cotton and large-scale promotion and application, make the industry of membraneless cotton big and strong, completely solve the problem of soil pollution caused by the surface membrane.

China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a speech to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Relations on Friday that at present, Sino-U.S. relations have once again reached a crossroads, and if the two sides can actively and inclusively look at each other, expand deepening and positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions, they can open up better prospects.
"China-US relations are our common asset, and we need to take care of each other."
He expressed the hope that all sides of the two countries will have knowledge to maintain the healthy and stable development of China-US relations with practical action, and jointly promote Chinese-US relations in the right direction.
Wang Yi once again stressed that China will certainly come out of a different development path than the traditional major powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determines that China will not and cannot repeat the trajectories of national supremacy, and also determines that China will not become the United States, will not challenge the United States, and no longer replace the United States.
Wang Yi said in a speech entitled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Opponents", that the deep-seated problem currently facing is that some American friends believe that China will also be powerful and even challenge and replace the United States' leadership in the world.
"This is obviously a major strategic miscalculation."
But this self-imagined suspicion is spreading, amplifying the existing contradictions, spawning new doubts, and making it more difficult to resolve specific issues between China and the United States.
Wang Yi pointed out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
The Chinese have never been able to expand their genes.
We believe that countries can coexist, exchange and learn in harmony.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China will neither replicate foreign models nor require other countries to replicate their practices.
Earlier Wang Yi met with former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger in New York, saying that Sino-U.S. cooperation will win and fight inevitably lose.
China has always been committed to developing long-term healthy and stable Sino-US relations, achieving non-conflict, non-confrontational, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.

The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal will retain President Trump's ability to implement a 25% tariff threat against imported cars, while at the same time allowing passenger cars, pickups and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico to be largely exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes the so-called "Chapter 232" tariffs on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a quota of 2.6 million exempted passenger cars each year to export to the United States.
Under a subsidiary arrangement, the pickup produced in both countries would be fully exempted from tariffs.

According to foreign media reports, in a care center in the suburbs of Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, two young lions play and play together, it is difficult to see any abnormalities, but they are not unique.
The University of Pretoria announced: "This is the first lion ever born by artificial insemination - the world's first pair."
Institutional scientists are working on the reproductive system of mother-in-law African lions.
Ganswind, director of the Institute for Mammal Studies at Pretoria University, said the two young lions born on August 25 were quite healthy and normal.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally reached the breakthrough.
"We harvested sperm from a healthy lion," Ganswindt said during a media visit.
Next, the researchers used to artificially inseminate lions when their hormone levels reached an appropriate level.
"Fortunately, the result was successful."
He said the researchers "did several attempts, but unexpectedly didn't spend too much effort."
He said the aforementioned research breakthroughs can be replicated, and scientists hope to use this technology to save endangered large cat species.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature noted that lions have been extinct in 26 countries in Africa, and the total number of surviving wild lions has plummeted by 43% over the past 20 years, with about 20,000 remaining.
African lions are listed as vulnerable animals by this group.
"If we don't do something for this animal, they will face extinction."
He said the new technology did not require lions to be reared, but only injected sperm into conceivable lions, as North America and Europe have done with captive elephants.
South Korea's exports fell the biggest in more than two years, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
Indeed, South Korea's average exports increased every day last month.
In addition, early-released initial value data shows that exports in the first weeks of September increased by two digits before long holidays.
South Korea's exports fell year-on-year to the largest since July 2016, down more than a 5.7% drop from an estimated Reuters survey of 11 analysts.
The initial value released on Monday showed exports in September amounted to $50.6 billion, down from $51.2 billion in August.
While the growing U.S.-China trade dispute could also afflict other export-dependent Chinese neighbors, South Korea's exports to China grew by 7.8% in September, expanding for its 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea's exports to the U.S. declined 11.8% due to a decline in oil product sales.
South Korea's memory chips and oil products overseas sales increased by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, although the market is concerned that the so-called chip "super cycle" may have peaked.
"The impact of the trade conflict will be unavoidable, however, as South Korea's exports rely heavily on the U.S. and Chinese markets."
Imports fell by 2.1% to $408 million, not much like the Reuters survey's forecast growth of 3.1%.
The initial value of the trade surplus in September was $9.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion in August.
The Ministry of Industry said that thanks to the United States and EU countries, global manufacturing will remain buoyant, which is a favorable factor for South Korea's exports.
"The increase in export prices caused by rising oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year."
"But the continued trade conflict between the United States and China, coupled with increased market volatility after rising interest rates in the United States, is a negative pressure on exports."
Exports per working day increased to $2.6 billion in September, up from $2.1 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival fell on September 24-26 this year, so in September only 19.5 working days, four days less than the same period last year.
South Korea's exports grew 4.7% in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchase Managers Index, South Korea's manufacturing activity rose in September but was supported by domestic orders as orders from China and Japan declined, which could threaten another export outlook.
North Korean media criticizes U.S. not relaxing sanctions against the DPRK
North Korea's Labor News released a comment on September 30, criticizing the United States for not relaxing its sanctions while seeking dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, calling it "an inconsistent" practice.
U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo said on the 14th that "in order to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, it is critical to comply with sanctions against North Korea", stressing the United States' position to continue to abide by UN sanctions resolutions.
In Singapore's joint statement, the two sides pledged to establish a new DPRK-U.S. relationship that is compatible with the desire of the people of the two countries to look forward to peace and prosperity.
The United States, on the one hand, has stepped up sanctions pressures and called for dialogue, an approach that is unquestionably contradictory.
If we want to establish new DPRK-US relations, build a permanently consolidated peace regime on the Korean peninsula and achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it is necessary to put building trust in the first place, starting with what can be done, and settling each step by step.
The U.S. should understand that the sanctions crackdown does not work for North Korea.
The article says that even the "North Devonsk" before "Kazan" also lauded the U.S. military.
"We're going to meet powerful potential adversaries. Just look at the 'North Germansk' submarine is enough."
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Fogo, also praised the submarine "North Devonsk".
"This submarine is impressive to see how the Russian Navy develops and uses resources, and its main efforts in research and development are first of all strengthening the submarine fleet," he said.
But the journal National Interests still believes that the United States maintains its advantage over Russia in this area.
"I believe that Western countries still have asymmetrical advantages."
Earlier it was reported that the Russian Navy will install the "Kazan" submarine in 2019.
"Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnodar", "Arkhangelsk" multi-purpose submarines are upgraded to "Vacuum Tree-M", with a drainage capacity of 13,800 tons, diving depth of 520 meters, personnel strength of 64 people, underwater speed of 31 knots, will carry mines, torpedoes and "calibre" and "Okinawa" cruise missiles.

This was his first time in the forum.
ignoring the U.S. threat!
The EU or will reach a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. government has announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, even urging other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But U.S. allies don't seem to have listened.
Iran's foreign minister, Zarif, told The New York Times on Tuesday that despite the U.S. threat of sanctioning any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the European Union to sell crude oil.
The core purpose of the agreement is to try to create a new payment mechanism, i.e. replace dollar transactions in an easy-to-trade or home currency manner.
The purpose of the approach is to hope to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from hindering financial transfers.
At the same time, while the EU is working to facilitate the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if it is achieved, this will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the United States which opposes the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
In an hour of interviews, Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the deal has the ability to "deprive" traditional U.S. allies, it effectively breaks the American side's attempts to cut Iran's revenues.
"This ensures that we sell and profit from oil," Zarif said, according to the 2015 agreement, countries have a legitimate right to trade with Iran.
Federica Mogherini, head of EU foreign policy, said in a statement: "No sovereign country or organization can accept anyone else to decide who they can trade with."
However, she also predicted that before the next US government sanctions begin in November, U.S. leaders could take a range of financial measures aimed at banks, businessmen and countries with commercial ties to Tehran.
In May, the U.S. government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that the agreement was defective and said it could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuels.
The U.S. then threatened to ban companies that bought Iranian oil and other goods from doing business in the United States.
This threat led some companies to evacuate Tehran, and Iran's currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and French officials have said the U.S. government could "take a presumption."
No doubt, according to a recent Turkish media report, the US sanctions did not seem to have a significant impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil minister, Zangane, recently revealed that no other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iranian oil.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Rouhani believe that a series of U.S. actions are aimed at "tempting" Iran to break the deal.
Zarif also disdained a series of oral attacks on the US side, and when asked if the United States would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed, "It's a regime change strategy that is the real purpose of the U.S."

Reporters learned from the National Committee on Health and Wellness that compared to decades ago, the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased, but the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
Experts pointed out in this regard that maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is "preventable disease", vigorously promote scientific fitness and reasonable diet.
According to the National Health and Health Commission's recently released "China Youth Health Education Core Information and Disclaimer" (2018 edition), the key to maintaining a healthy weight is rational dieting and scientific movement.
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not conducive to health.
The health risks behind the "small fat pier" cannot be overlooked.
China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention nutrition and health said that overweight obesity jeopardizes the normal growth and development of adolescents, has a negative impact on their mental, behavioral, cognitive and intellectual abilities, and even leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood fat in children.
At the same time, adolescents' overweight obesity can easily continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes in adulthood.
Dingshan said that in 2010-2012, nutrition and health testing of Chinese residents showed that the overweight rate of children and adolescents aged 6-17 in China was 9.6%, obesity rates were 6.4%, plus 16%.
At the same time, overweight obesity in children and adolescents is a feature of boys higher than girls, cities higher than rural ones, and overweight obesity rates have risen significantly in recent decades.
How Do Teens Deal With Overweight Obesity?
Zhang Li, Deputy Director of the Scientific Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of the National Sports Administration, pointed out that the main cause of youth obesity at present is due to excessive caloric intake and insufficient physical activity.
For this simplicity of obesity, attention should be paid to scientific exercise plus reasonable dietary control.
Zhang Li pointed out that maintaining a healthy weight, the most important concept is "preventable disease", which is an important part of comprehensive CP education for schools, parents and students, universal overweight and obesity hazards, and raising prevention awareness among adolescents.
Adolescents should undergo regular medical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, detect prematurely, scientifically judge whether there are problems with overweight and obesity in order to take timely interventions.
For adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Steel Strong recommends that in addition to actively scientifically arranging meals and sports, teenagers are in a special physiological stage, should avoid the use of hunger or half-hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and should not blindly take weight loss drugs.

China Xinxiang News Agency Yichang Oct. 1 (Guo Xiaoying Liu Min) Newly revised "Three Gorges-Gzhou Dam Water Supply Terminal Transit Traffic Regulations" (hereinafter referred to as "Transit Procedures") officially began implementation on October 1, and three Gorges submerged aircraft after two years of test flight, formally unified with the ship's gates.
On the first day of the implementation of the new regulations, the navigation of the Three Gorges-Guzhou Dam waters was well ordered.
The Yangtze Three Gorges Air Navigation Administration issued its first security inspection plan at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out an inspection of 160 ships with a total of 124 vessels.

The scheduling regulations add to the "classification control" principle of ship's over-the-ship dam planning, according to the lock and subship function position clearly defined the prioritization of ships across the dam, and adjusted the short passenger boat crossing to the same priority level as model vessels and good faith boats.
It is also two weeks after the test operation of the submersible, officially unified scheduling with the lock.
The long-range and wide demonstration vessels of the Sichuan River and Three Gorges Quay District, as well as new energy power ships, have also been ranked among the top priorities for the first time.
At the same time, the scheduling regulations adjusted the "navigation and dispatch management waters" from the previous 180 km of near-dam water to Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to 541.8 km of Shizhongjiang Bridge Waters, and divided into "core waters, near-dam waters, controlled waters, scheduling waters".
This move is conducive to the ship's choice of suitable water for locking, reducing the backlog of dam areas for gated ships.
The scheduling regulations also based on the existing ship's dam, stand-off characteristics, proposed good faith restrictions such as cancellation of claims for violations by ships and delayment of 24 hours.
After the three isthmus water storage, the conditions of navigation in the Kuo district were improved, promoting the rapid development of Yangtze River shipping.
According to data, the annual cargo pass volume of three fjords and Guzhou Dam vessels increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 138 million tons and 140 million tons in 2017 respectively.
Three Gorges submersible aircraft tested 5,767 ships over the past two years, passengers 162,200 people, cargo volume of 1,7128 thousand tons.
Zhang Zingyuan, Deputy Director of the Three Gorges Passenger Administration, said that "the Regulations" has a positive effect on promoting integrity over-the-counter management, maintaining the navigation order of the two dam hubs, and unwinding the ship's downtime pressure in the dam area.

In September, China's comprehensive PMI lap-up increased manufacturing PMI lap-down.
China's National Bureau of Statistics released data on 30 September, the comprehensive PMI output index in China was 54.1%, higher than last month and annual averages of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that Chinese enterprises production and business activities generally remained stable.
The manufacturing production index and the non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the integrated PMI output index, were 53.0% and 54.9%, respectively, a year-on-year decline.
Among them, China's manufacturing PMI is 50.8%, a decline of 0.5 percentage points.
Zhao Qing River said that this month's manufacturing PMI has five main features:
First, the basics of manufacturing are generally smooth.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, 14 sectors of PMI are located in the expansion zone, among which pharmaceutical, special equipment, electrical machinery and other manufacturing enterprises PMI are located at more than 53.5% high operating level, faster growth rate.
The second is a slight fluctuation in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, down 0.3 percent and 0.2 percentage points respectively from last month, with supply and demand maintaining a state of boom but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively, below the previous month's 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points, with both peak temperatures falling to a year-long low.
Fourth, the cost of enterprise raw materials procurement has increased.
The price index for the purchase of primary raw materials is 59.8%, up 1.1 percentage point from last month, and the factory price index is 54.3%, as compared to last month, which is the annual high.
The fifth is that large enterprises operate robustly, and the business situation of small enterprises continues to improve.
Large enterprise PMI is 52.1%, as compared to last month, this year the index has been in the expansion range of 52.0% or more, and this month's production index and new order index have improved, which is the main driving force for manufacturing to keep expanding; medium-sized enterprises PMI is 48.7%, lower than 1.7 percentage points last month, located in the contraction zone; small enterprise PMI is 50.4%, higher than 0.4 percentage points last month, rising for two consecutive months.
In the same month, China's non-manufacturing business activity index was 54.9%, up 0.7 percentage points from last month, rising for two consecutive months.
Zhao Qing River believes that the non-manufacturing industry in general continues to maintain a stable and good development momentum.
The index of business activity in such industries as road transport, securities and real estate continues to be below the critical point with a decrease in total business.
Reuters Nagoya Nov. 5 - Japan's central bank president, Yoshida Dongyan, said on Monday that the central bank realized that long-term implementation of ultra-lenient monetary policies could squeeze financial institutions' margins and potentially destabilize the country's banking system.
He said the Bank of Japan needs to maintain its large-scale stimulus program, given inflationary downturns and uncertainties in overseas economies, while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under continued monetary easing, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly impacted," Mr. Heda said in a speech to business leaders at Nagoya.
He said the banking system could be turbulent if financial institutions are more proactive in taking risks to compensate for the impact that low interest rates have had on narrowing margins over the years.
"While these risks are not significant at present, the central bank will closely monitor developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures," he said.
Earlier Monday's record of the Bank of Japan meeting showed that at its September limousine session, the Committee on Policy discussed rising costs for long-term easing policies.
The meeting record shows that one member said if the economy continues to expand, "the Bank of Japan has more room for policy elasticity in the future."
The record shows that another member said the committee should discuss how long the Japanese central bank could maintain its stimulus policy, given its limitations.
He said the Bank of Japan would assess the financial risks posed by loose policies, while also considering uncertainties surrounding Japanese economic prospects, which could affect global demand due to Sino-US trade frictions and rising protectionism.
"The impact of such problems on the Japanese economy is temporarily limited," he said.
"But how the problem persists, the impact on the Japanese economy may grow," he added.
"It is necessary to pursue a strong monetary easing policy consistently while considering both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," he said.
Despite the increasing drawbacks of aggressive stimulus programs, such as long-term low interest rates eroding financial institutions' profits, inflationary downturns have forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the program.
Japan's central bank maintained its monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the global trade war, he ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future.
On June 1, 2018, Cardiff of the United States, a corporate logo on Tesla's electric car.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO Musk have agreed to pay their respective $20 million fines to financial regulators, who will also quit the company's chairmanship but remain CEO.
The settlement will set a final line for Tesla's two-month turmoil.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission's settlement of the securities fraud charges disclosed on Saturday will give investors a chilling breath.
Investors who feared protracted legal battles would only further hit the still losing electric car company.
The SEC indicted Musk on Thursday for fraud, saying its August 7 tweet misled investors.
He is considering privatizing Tesla for $420 per share and has secured financing.
The SEC said the tweets were in fact unfounded, and their market turmoil had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could bolster Tesla, which has been hit by Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, head of asset management at Boston Common, said the settlement should give Musk more oversight while not taking "destructive" measures to drive him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds Tesla's battery maker Panasonic shares.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla must appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors and a board of directors to develop control over Musk's external communications.
"It is in the best interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareholders," SEC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charges on Thursday caused Tesla's market capitalization to evaporate about $7 billion, which was $45.2 billion at Friday, down from GM's $47.5 billion.
The SEC retracted its request to remove Musk from the company's leadership in a settlement agreement.
Many investors say the penalty would be disastrous.
"I think this is the best possible outcome for all relevant people," said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a "neutral" rating and called the SEC's penalties "from fine-tuning" for Musk.
"He's still a CEO for Tesla."
Neither Musk nor Tesla acknowledged or denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responded to a request for comment.
The settlement agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
Beijing Morning News (reporter Wang Ping) Beijing Morning News reporter recently learned from Beijing Construction Group that 2019, one of the core building blocks of Beijing World Gardens Park - Beijing World Gardens Performance Square project will first adopt a multi-color ETF puzzle membrane structure, 5440 square meters of film structure will be presented with deep red, deep green, orange, blue, red, green six colors, under the stripe of laso steel thread to show the shape of "butterfly wing".

General Secretary Xi Jinping made a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium, injecting strong confidence into the broader stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "let entrepreneurs unload the burden of thinking and lightly move forward" provokes a strong resonance among the majority of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
The vitality of the market comes from people, especially entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurship.
In the 40-year history of reform and opening up, there are hundreds of thousands of stories of entrepreneurial entrepreneurs and innovation, and the growth and growth of entrepreneurial groups continue to drive the breakout of China's economy.
For a while, people in society have made some negative and skeptical statements about the private economy.
The so-called "private economic outfield theory" and the "new public-private partnership theory" caused some entrepreneurs' doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have an impact on some export enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structure leads to transformation and upgrading pressures; some policies are inconsistent with each other, policy effect is superimposed, or the working style is simple, resulting in some initially good policies having the opposite effect.
Factors are intertwined, the private economy encounters difficulties, some private enterprises run in difficult situations, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
In this context, correcting the misunderstandings of understanding, removing the entrepreneur's ideological burden and making enterprises one-on-one want to develop, the government one-on-one wants to promote development, which is related to market confidence and development expectations, has a particularly deep real meaning.
The symposium once again emphasized the "three unchanging" important argument: "The status and role of non-public economy in our economic and social development has not changed!"
From the in-depth promotion of concise decentralization, establishment of power list system to creating a rule of law environment for protecting entrepreneurs' legitimate interests, creation of a fair and competitive market environment, shaping an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society, in recent years, the Party Central Committee has given unprecedented attention to entrepreneurs and institutional safeguards.
The colloquium also explicitly proposed policy initiatives to strongly support the development and growth of private enterprises in six areas, and launched a series of practical actions dedicated to "lightly forwarding" private enterprises.
These are a great inspiration for the entrepreneurial community and give more hope to all sectors of society.
The mist is dispersed, the approach has been set up, and the key is to implement it.
We must constantly create a better development environment for the private economy, help private enterprises to solve difficulties in development, help achieve China's economic transformation and upgrading; we must make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovation vitality and creativity potential.
China's economy enters the process of reaching high-quality development, requires more entrepreneurs to demonstrate their ambitions, and also provides greater space and stage for entrepreneurial creativity.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening of reforms and removing obstacles, the private economy will usher in better prospects for development and opportunities, towards a broader stage.

Hanshan chicken soup exports to China 20 times for four years or more related to the growth of empty nest youth - Xinhua
In four years, China's exports of chicken soup have increased 20 times. Analysis: Increasing the number of young people with empty nest
Last year, South Korea exported more than $100,000 to China, a sharp increase of about 20 times from four years ago in 2013.
The analysis believes that this increase is related to the increasing number of young people in China's empty nest, which leads to easy food sales, and the increased attention of young people to nutrition.
The data was published on the 5th day by the Korean Agricultural and Aquarian Food Exchange (AT).
Last year, South Korea's exports to China amounted to $1003.39 million and weighed 218.59 million kilograms, a sharp increase of 2094% and 3668.8% respectively from 2013.

As of this year, China's single-family family broke the 200 million mark, and is expected to increase to 30% of the total population in 2020, local food companies have also targeted "one-food families" to launch various convenient foods.
In addition, the analysis also indicates that avian influenza is the biggest factor impeding the growth of chicken soup in mainland China.
AT said that from November 2016 to April last year, the outbreak of avian influenza in South Korea, relevant departments completely banned chicken soup exports to China, resulting in a sharp decline in export volume.
Exports to China in 2016 amounted to $840,000, and exports fell to $100,000 last year due to bird flu.

The river port is the largest port in Yunnan's China-Vietnam border, located in Red Riverzhou Hekou County, Yunnan Province, with a view to the rivey of Vietnam's Old Street City and one of the country's ports.
With the continuous deepening of the construction of the country "Belt and Road", as one of the most convenient routes connecting China to Southeast Asia, the flow of entry and exit from the river ports has steadily increased.
At 7:30 a.m. in the morning, sunlight had just revealed a corner, and the area of the river's mouth-to-ceiling was set up early on by local people and tourists coming to watch the flag lifting ceremony.
At 0745 hours, the flag lifting ceremony began on time, and the members of the National Gate Guard at the river gate border guard checkpoint shook their spirits and escorted the flag to the footsteps.
After the commanding officer gave the lifting of the flag directive, the lifting hand struggled to spread an arc with his arms, and the bright five-star red flag as "the eagle's wings" generally stretched out the surface of the flag, accompanied by the national anthem excited and strong melodies slowly rising up.
"The celebration of National Day Flag Raising at every significant time node such as New Year's Day, Spring Festival and National Day not only shows the image of China but also stimulates the patriotism of all ethnic groups in the border."
The commemorative officers who participated in the flag lifting ceremony said.
It is reported that the national gate commemorative army responsible for the flag lifting ceremony of the river port border checkpoint consists of more than 40 officers and soldiers from various positions at the river port border checkpoint, from three people to a large scale commemorative army, this team has been through more than 60 years of history, since the formation of the country's foreign military activities ceremonial tasks have been carried out more than 70 times.

During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, some positive messages were released around the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon recounted the DPRK's "inreversible" abandonment and said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong Un could meet before the end of the year.
The U.S. State Department then said Secretary of State Pompeo would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the promise of the US-DPRK summit in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, the North and Korea broke the ice to open the road for dialogue, held a meeting between the leaders of the DPRK and the United States. The situation on the peninsula has been slowed down and the principle of dialogue in resolving the Peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
First, the fact that "the essence of the Peninsula issue is a security problem" has not changed, and achieving peace on the peninsula is key to properly and balancedly addressing the legitimate security concerns of all parties, rather than stifling pressure on each other and emphasizing their own claims.
Second, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned have diverged on the steps and ways to achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula, and because of the long-standing lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the "who first and who after" game thinking is still strong.
At an open meeting of the Security Council on the Korean Peninsula, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York, various voices around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK have once again highlighted the two "no change" points regarding the peninsula.
Secretary of State Pompeo insists that sanctions on North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Russia's foreign minister, Lavrov, stressed the principle of "action-based response" and said: "The downward trend in sanctions should be synchronized with North Korea's steps on its path to gradually abandoning nuclear weapons."
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to fully, fully and accurately implement the Council's DPRK-related resolutions, but pressure is not a goal, implementation of sanctions and promotion of political settlement are the requirements of the Council's resolutions, both cannot be ignored or chosen alone.
As Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in relations between North Korea and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Security Council to consider launching reversible terms at a timely date, thereby encouraging North Korea and all parties concerned to take greater steps towards denuclearization.
Looking back at the past, denuclearization of the peninsula and every progress in the peace process require sufficient political courage from all parties.
At present, in the face of the growing expectations of the international community to promote a political solution to the Korean Peninsula problem, all parties concerned should demonstrate their political vigour and make political decisions, implement commitments and resolve problems, continue to take steps towards each other, along with advancing the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establishing peace mechanisms on the peninsula.

Health centers and health stations provide flu vaccination services, especially on national holidays
The Health Service has ordered 150,000 doses of the four-valent flu vaccine in 2018-2019 this year, and at this stage it is a priority for high-risk people to receive free vaccinations. In order to facilitate residents' holidays, the health centers and health stations under the Department of Health provide services especially during the National Day holiday (October 1 and 2) from 9:00 am to 1:00 noon.
In addition to the above-mentioned measures, health centers and stations under the Department of Health have extended flu vaccination services from Monday to Friday until 8:00 p.m. Since September 30 at 4:00 p.m., they have been vaccinated for more than 3,714 people in the same period last year.
Free vaccinations include the following Macao residents: persons under 6 months to 18, aged 50 and above, pregnant women, all patients with chronic diseases including obese (i.e. those with BMI of 30 or more), as well as staff in nursing homes, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, all health workers, and Macau residents who work at gambling venues.
At the same time, other persons deemed necessary to be vaccinated by the Health Service, including the public sector, will have an initiative to contact the agencies concerned when they are placed on a list.
In order to facilitate vaccinators and reduce provincial vaccination time, the Health Bureau will send medical personnel to China's secondary schools, primary schools, kindergartens and nurseries between October and December this year for collective flu vaccination of young children, small and medium-sized students, teachers and employees; in addition, the Health Bureau will arrange staff to go to elderly and disabled homes, a large number of public sectors or other institutions.
If students and young children who fail to participate in collective vaccinations, they can be vaccinated by Macao residents' ID cards, health service user cards, flu vaccination cards (if any), student documents, employee certificates or professional documentation from December 3, 2018.
The Health Service reminds residents that between September 2017 and August 2018, those who have been vaccinated against the flu vaccine from 2017 to 2018 still need a new season of influenza vaccination starting in September 2018, as the composition of the influenza antigen contained in the Northern Hemisphere Flu Vaccine has been updated, targeting the Northern Hemisphere's 2018-2019 winter and seasonal flu in summer 2019.
Macao's flu peak usually occurs in January-March each year, more late than the temperate zones (such as northern China and Japan), and the health department calls on high-risk people such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, obese and chronic patients who are most likely to develop complications following influenza infection and frequent exposure to high-risk individuals to be vaccinated as soon as possible.

Reuters Tokyo, Oct. 1 - The Bank of Japan's short-view survey quarterly report on Monday showed that the confidence of large Japanese manufacturers in September hit their lowest level in more than a year because of rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production to put companies under pressure.
The survey showed little evidence that escalating global trade frictions have hit the confidence of large manufacturing firms.
But the risk of a full-blown trade war has crippled business prospects and could threaten corporate capital expenditures.
Active capital expenditure is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the Bank of Japan's view that robust economic expansion would help drive inflation to accelerate its target of 2 percent, even though there are indications that businesses are gradually shifting costs to customers.
"With concerns stoked by the global trade war, confidence in manufacturers tends to stagnate due to slowing exports and weak factory production," said South Wuzhi, chief investigator at AFP.
"Confidence is still high. And I don't think that confidence will continue to decline because corporate profits are improving and prices are rising."
The short-view survey showed that the September large manufacturing boom judgment index fell from positive 21% three months ago to positive 19%, deteriorating for a third consecutive season.
The market's mid-point is positive 22.
In September, the large non-manufacturing boom judgment index fell from positive 24% in June to positive 22%, deteriorating for the first time in eight quarters.
The Reuters investigation is positive 22.
The survey showed that in December, both large manufacturing and non-manufacturing market conditions were stable.
Investors don't care about the decline in the short-view forecasting index, and the Japanese stock market.N225 climbed to a 27-year high on Monday as the continued depreciation of the Japanese yen helped improve the export earnings prospects for Japanese enterprises.
Capital expenditure is robust.
Despite a decline in corporate confidence, the latest short-view highlights robust enterprise capital spending plans that benefit from renewed capacity and increased investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages caused by ageing populations.
The central bank's short-view survey showed that large enterprises planned to increase capital expenditure in the current fiscal year by 13.4% in March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
South Wuzhi said that all enterprise capital expenditure plans for the fiscal year increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy era.
"There is still room for further growth in capital spending given the small-scale enterprises to increase their profit projections from now on, but this largely depends on the impact of trade wars on corporate confidence," he said.
The short-view survey shows that the ability of enterprises to transfer costs is enhanced, with a positive 7 per cent output price index for large enterprises, one of the highest levels in a decade, an encouraging sign reflecting Japan's efforts to fight deflation.
The index that measures the employment situation of large enterprises touches negative 23%, which is the most tightest level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefit from robust corporate spending, Japan's second quarter has rebounded since its contraction in January-March this year.
But the escalating summer trade frictions and disruption of supply chains are shattering Japan's export-dependent economic prospects.
In United States dollars, the rate of import and export of services increased by 16.4%.
The Ministry of Commerce's website press release cites the head of the service and trade division, saying that the total import and export of emerging services in January-August exceeded 1 trillion yuan, increasing faster than the overall.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services amounted to 1138.39 billion yuan, an increase of 20.9%, higher than the overall growth rate of service imports and exports by 10.4 percentage points, pushing the share of emerging services up nearly three percentage points.
In terms of service exports, in January-August, service exports continued the rapid growth momentum since this year, with export growth faster than import growth rate of 5.7 percentage points.
Among them, the top three areas of growth rate are telecommunications computers and information services, personal culture and entertainment services, insurance services, with a growth rate of 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5%, respectively.
The head of the service and trade division also noted that the share of emerging services imports in January-August has also gradually increased.
In January-August, emerging service imports grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of services imports, an increase of 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year.
Among them, financial services, intellectual property use fees, telecommunications computers and information services imports increased by more than 20%, at 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2%, respectively.

Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 in the German Bremen Convention and Exhibition Centre, attended by more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, expert scholars and young students from all over the world.
The President of the International Astronautical Federation, Jean-Eif Legar, delivered a speech at the opening ceremony saying that global spaceflight is no longer just a handful of countries and institutions involved, and this year's number of participants has increased significantly compared to the previous session, indicating an increasing number of institutions and individuals are joining.
He called on countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of aerospace.
China's Deputy Minister of Industry and Informatization and Director of National Space Administration Zhang Keqiang introduced China's space program when he attended the exchange event, and said that China would expand international cooperation in the field of space to contribute to the cause of human space.
The participation of relevant institutions such as China Space Science and Technology Group Corporation, China Space Engineering Group Company and a number of representatives of private enterprises demonstrated the latest achievements of China's aerospace industry, including various types of launch vehicles, satellites and applications for space science and technology.
The International Astronautical Congress, held annually since 1950, is the largest event in the world's aviation industry.
The 5-day Congress is co-sponsored by the International Astronautical Federation, the International Academy of Astronautics, the University of Bremen Centre for Applied Science and Microgravity Research and the International Institute of Space Law.
Reuters Beijing, November 5 - China's foreign trade center released a press release on Sunday saying that the Guangqiao exhibition will show that China's foreign trade situation remains complex and severe, with 80.6% of enterprises expecting to export better than last year or flat in 2018.
But considering the continuous increase in domestic raw materials, labor and other integrated factor costs, as well as the increased impact of trade frictions between China and the United States, exhibitors also believe that next year's export situation is not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Guangqiao Conference, Xu Shuang, Deputy Secretary-General of Guangqiao Meeting, Press Spokesperson and Deputy Director of China's Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of buyers from outside Guangqiao meeting and export turnover have decreased year-on-year.
189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions attended this session, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Export turnover of RMB 206.494 billion (combination of USD 29.86 billion), a decrease of 1% year-on-year.
From the market point of view, trades for Japan, ASEAN 10 countries, "BRICS", South Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, 2.5%, and traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, 0.8% respectively.
From the point of view of the industry, transport tools, machinery and equipment, construction and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, textile clothing, household appliances decreased by 13.0%, 6.7%.
Xu said that as a barometer and wind gauge for China's foreign trade, the current state of sourcing and export trading data shows that next year China's foreign trade development still faces many uncertain and unstable factors.
But with the in-depth advancement of supply-side structural reforms, as well as recent national and local policy measures such as "six stability", China's new momentum for foreign trade development is accelerating accumulation, and corporate market diversification continues to make new progress, these are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
"Combining all the factors, it is expected that China's foreign trade and exports will continue to grow smoothly throughout the year, with further improvement in quality and efficiency."
China's Customs Administration announced that exports grew by 14.5% year-on-year in September, imports increased by 14.3%, trade surplus of $31.69 billion in September, export growth and trade surplus were the highest since February this year.
Despite the escalating trade frictions between China and the United States, China's exports in September still significantly outpaced expectations, strong foreign demand, enterprises to seize export before imposing tariffs on the U.S. yuan exchange rate depreciation, or main support factors, also show some degree of Chinese foreign trade resilience, but the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war on confidence, the impact on the industrial chain can not be underestimated, analysts believe that the challenge of China's foreign trade may appear in the fourth quarter or next year.
The Reuters investigation revealed that the U.S. fund manager in September proposed an increase in cash holdings and continued to be cautious as the United States and China began their latest round of reciprocal import duties, and there were no signs of a detente in the dispute.
But according to 12 fund managers involved in the survey, North America's asset allocation has risen to its highest since June 2017, while UK, eurozone and especially emerging markets have declined.
The global share of stock allocations averaged 56.6% and bonds accounted for 35.5%, largely in line with last month's survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
A fund manager at a large fund company said: "Some economic data has brought confidence in the market, but trade wars are still the biggest concerns, so it's best to be prepared to enter when markets fall back."
But fund managers still favored stocks in September, especially U.S. equities, even though the U.S. shares were considered to be priced too high.
Today, China's open landmark Shanghai, the world's first large national-level exhibition on import theme - China International Import Expo has officially opened its doors.
A show is like a "window" that gives the world a better understanding of a city and a country.
Through this "window" in the exhibition, people see moving towards a higher level of "opening China"; by using this "window" in the exhibition, we welcome the world's mutual benefit and win-win with China's "reform and opening up."
"For a country, open as a cocoon butterfly, although it will experience a moment of pain, but will be replaced with new life."
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of the open road reveals an important reason why China can.
Looking back at the reform and opening up for 40 years, China dared to enter the world market in the sea, although it has encountered whirlwinds and waves, but always faced all risk challenges with an open posture, constantly releasing internal driving forces, and continuously improving competitiveness.
It can be said that China's real-world achievements have powerfully interpreted the value and meaning of openness.
Standing at the new historical starting point, holding an import-focused exhibition is a major decision made by Comrade Xi Jinping's central Party Central Committee to promote a new round of high-level openness to the outside world. It is a major step in China's initiative to open markets to the world and its practical action to support economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing strong and clear will for "China's opening doors won't close, but only get bigger."
The number of exhibitors from all countries is high, the booth "one difficult", which is the most affirmative and best response to China's development of an open economy in a broader, wider area and deeper level.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built a high wall of trade protectionism, returned to the old path of unilateralism, increased international concern about the prospects for free trade, and added many uncertainties to the world economy that is recovering.
In the context of such an era, this event at Huangpu River Bank reflects China's defense of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets and share future Chinese confidence and responsibility.
Walk fast, and walk far away.
China's open heart and embrace of the world not only strongly promotes its own development, but also brings a sprawling "China Opportunity" to countries and regions around the world.
In recent years, China has promoted and promoted the co-construction of the Belt and Road, initiated the launch of the AIIB, established the Silk Road Fund......China offers a series of international public goods, provides real export markets, development opportunities and jobs, so that national enterprises can take advantage of China's development "fast car".
The Expo is also such a public product, a large platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On top of this platform, more than 3000 enterprises in more than 130 countries and regions shine on the market with a variety of distinctive quality products and services, taking a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to national enterprises, domestic consumers are actually benefiting.
By building this "optimised and improved" platform, we provide a variety of channels of quality supply for consumer upgrades to meet the people's individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening door opens and expands, the flow of goods is easy to use, and the footsteps towards a better life will be more solid.
From a more macro perspective, the meaning of the Expo has exceeded the scope of economic and trade, but instead look at the future, convey open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced, win-win ideas, and form a consensus to jointly address today's challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; China is good, the world is better.
We look forward to bringing the world with greatness and success; we are more hopeful about moving toward a higher level of "open China" and working with the world to build a glorious future for human destiny community.
Foreign media: The United States and Canada reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement includes Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, as well as a temporary non-imposition of tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
According to foreign media reports, a Canadian source revealed on September 30 local time that the United States and Canada have reached a framework agreement on NAFTA.
The agreement included Canada's opening of its dairy market to the United States, as well as a temporary non-imposition of tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
On 27 September, the United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on updating NAFTA, but the United States and Canada were unable to reach an agreement prior to the August 31 deadline set by the U.S. to extend negotiations until September 30.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canada's Foreign Minister Friland said that Canada would only sign a favorable agreement, "focusing on substance rather than timeline." We will continue to negotiate in the hope of reaching an agreement which is in the national interest of Canada.
More than 90% of Brazilian women voters say that the presidential candidates do not take into account the needs of women.
According to the South American Diaspora Network, data released by the National Geographic Institute of Brazil (IBGE) recently showed that more than 90% of Brazilian women don't think presidential candidates take into account the needs of women.
At present, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million people, and if all Brazilian women are brought together to form a country, then the country's population will be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice the size of Spain's national population.
In Brazil, women make up 52% of the total number of voters and men make up 48%, while women make a very high proportion of voters, but in Brazilian Congress there are only 10%.
Among the 193 countries around the world, Brazilian women are ranked only 154th in political participation, higher than Arabs.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still failed to achieve the right they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that this phenomenon exists because of the effects of ancient patriarchal societies, racism and the co-operative role of capitalist values.
"Politics should have been made up of citizens claiming civil rights, identity, access to public goods and the same society as multiple social groups. But Brazil's politics is a monopoly on a particular group with no majority of its population being represented."
A previous study by Locomotivea also noted that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel elected politicians were able to represent their rights, 90 per cent disapproved of decision-making by politicians and 93 per cent disagreed with the current government's governance policies.
"We need to reverse the underrepresentation of women in parliament, and Brazil's political system continues to be affected by inequality. To date, there are still serious gender, class and racial discrimination in its political sphere."
Despite women's lack of rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 percent of women believed they could make a difference in democratic elections and 72 percent were interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women less biased.

On the same day, more than 200 flights took off at the T2 terminal in Guilin IIjiang International Airport.
The design of the new terminal building is inspired by Guilin hill nails, viewing as a "mountain water crown", looking close to the "dragon climbed field" sight and roofing ceiling in Guilin mountain waters.
The new terminal at Guilin Airport can meet the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people per hour, applying intelligent baggage sorting system, security integration platform, face recognition and other "smart air port" technical means, planning to cover a variety of business areas such as catering, department stores, tax exemption and leisure entertainment.
As growth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is largely uninvigorated, the United States is increasingly becoming the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, in New Jersey, the United States, a containerized cargo ship parked inside the port.
Because current U.S. growth has benefited from the time that tax cuts have garnered fiscal stimulus, the country's economy is also closely watched by the outside world.
"As the United States recovers full employment, economic collapse is inevitable."
He said the only question was when it would happen, and in his view he might just not push back ahead.
Despite Barclays' optimism about the U.S. economic outlook before the end of this year, the bank acknowledged that it was more difficult to predict longer timeframes.
"With a lack of more sustainable investment growth to boost economic growth potential, current fiscal-inspired growth will be difficult to sustain," Barclays economists said in a study.
"At a time of lack of investment growth, the economy's risk of hard landing in 2020 will rise," they said.
A series of business surveys will roughly show that major economies are in the economic cycle phase at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and U.S. manufacturing survey, scheduled to be released next Monday, will be garnered attention with the service industry survey being published on Wednesday.
But the focus of next week's data will inevitably be on U.S. non-farm employment data, which will be released next Friday, providing clues as to whether tighter job markets are driving a significant increase in wages.
Its importance is not only because it is important for the profitability of enterprises and consumers' purchasing power, but also because a pay jump or an increase in overall inflation could troubling Federal Reserve (Fed/FED) officials.
"Salaries will be of great concern, as they may have risen exponentially again from the previous month.
September's increase may not exceed 3% over the same period as last year, but we can fully expect to break it next month," economists from the Dutch International Group (ING) wrote in a study.
As holidays in China and other parts of Asia result in the region's dim data next week, European politics may become a source of market fluctuations.
The Italian government ignores its previous financial commitments to the European Union, and other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether or not they will strongly oppose Italy's decision. Tria does not support it, he wants to abide by EU rules.
As Brexit negotiations enter a critical phase, the British Conservative Party's annual meeting in Birmingham may also spark.
At the same time, as Brazil holds much-anticipated presidential elections next weekend, concerns around emerging markets are unlikely to weaken.
[Summary] After the ship's completion, it will be delivered to the Eastern Sea Division of China's National Oceanographic Administration and Chen Zhi, Chief of the Marine Early Warning Monitoring Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the vessel would be put into use for the development of China's offshore marine observing system and advancing global ocean observation.
On September 29, China's first 3,000-ton large floating ship "Wangyang Red 22" was submerged in the Chinese fleet.
After the ship's completion, it will break the current equipment bottleneck in China's protection work in large buoys, submerged and laid out, recovered and reclaimed.
The "Sunshine Red 22" wheel is mainly used for the regular patrol maintenance of boulders/submarines, periodic laying, recycling, emergency laying and reclamation of boulders/submarines, recovery and restoration work, while also having the ability to carry out integrated marine survey missions such as fault surveys.
The new ship has a total length of 89 meters, the width of the model is 18 meters, the depth of the model is 7.2 meters, and its endurance is 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of Wu Ship Group, said: "Wangyang Red 22 is China's first large floating-float operation ship and the only domestic working vessel with a ten meter high boulder operating capacity to further enhance our country's large beautic safety capability."
It is understood that after the completion of the vessel will be delivered to the Eastern Sea Division of China's National Oceanic Administration, and Chen Zhi, Head of the Marine Early Warning Monitoring Service of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the ship will be put into use for the development of China's offshore marine observation system and promotion of global ocean observations.
"This ship also has large buoys and laying repair operations, as well as marine comprehensive investigation capabilities, is our first integrated vessel dedicated to the operation of mid- and far sea buoys and ocean comprehensive investigation.
With such a buoy operating vessel, our ocean observations and marine surveys will have strong leverage in the future."
The 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series in Qingdao Station "Mazerun Cup" was postponed to October 1 due to the impact of typhoon "Tana Mei", which originally scheduled to start on September 30, and before the race held in Qingdao Ofan Center met with a total of 12 water wing biathlon fleet captains from six countries and regions.
Due to the typhoon "Tana Mei", the strong winds in the harbor pool continue, maximum wind speed even up to 24 knots, the launch signal was delayed from 30 p.m. by nearly 90 minutes, and the wind speed is still not reduced, tournament referee Annie Mdrant announced canceling the first day of the game, delaying the game until the afternoon of October 1.
"The strong winds blowing from the shore continue, and the sea conditions are really too intense."
"In such a case, no one knows when the winds are shattered against the navigator."
Close to the city's playing field, cancellation is the smartest choice in terms of current conditions."
All ready-made crew members are still somewhat disappointed.
"The boat is ready to stop, and we are in good condition."
Max Richardson, the helmsman of Qingdao's team, said: "But I know that the rematch is the right choice, and hopefully today we will be able to play a little bit."
Omica Wilkinson, the New Zealand team's "star of hope" for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, said: "Losing a day makes the game more interesting.
Because today's score will increase, and there are only two days left for the game.
"You're going to be especially desperate."

Despite the global financial market turbulence, the Hong Kong Financial Authority said on Monday that foreign exchange fund investment income in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, but better than last season, because under the Sino-U.S. trade war, overseas stocks rose high and foreign currency losses were significantly narrowed.
According to the latest data of the HKMA, in July-September 2018 foreign exchange funds received investment income of HK$1.6 billion, which is significantly lower than the same period last year's HK$61.8 billion, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
At the legislative meeting, CFC President Chen Delin said that at the beginning of the Sino-U.S. trade war, Hong Kong and emerging market stock indexes ran counter to the US stock index, until the end of September and early October after the U.S. stock market index successively peaked, the market sentiment began to reverse, as investors gradually realized that the trade war was also detrimental to the United States itself.
"A change in market sentiment is a good thing, and if the trade war has only unilateral effects, it will not help to resolve things."
"If the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, volatility in financial markets will continue to rise."
In the third quarter of this year, FX Fund's share investment losses in Hong Kong narrowed from 8% to 4.7 billion kong yuan compared with the previous quarter, and overseas equity investment gains increased significantly by 172% to 12.8 billion kong yuan; foreign exchange losses amounted to HK$16.2 billion, bonds revenues were reduced by 24% and 31% respectively on a quarterly basis, mainly reflecting the general increase in the United States dollar against major currencies during the season and the U.S. fertility rate fell below its three-point level in mid-September.
The foreign exchange fund is mainly used to support the Hong Kong dollar.
Since 1983, Hong Kong has introduced a linkage exchange rate system linked to the United States dollar.
For the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen said that economic and asset market uncertainty has increased, downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is robust, well-protected, and strong seismic resistance.
"Hong Kong's international investment position is abundant, with a net foreign asset value of $1.4 trillion equivalent to 4 times the GDP, more than Singapore's 2.5 times and Japan's 0.6 times, enough to cope with its downturn or reversal."
The recent decline in Hong Kong dollar interest rate and the expansion of the U.S. dollar margin, Chen Delin pointed out that the combined value of Hong Kong on September 21 has risen more than 400 basis points, the market is generally believed to be mainly related to the increase in Hong Kong dollar interest rate, after which the Hong Kong dollar against the U.S. dollar hovered around the level of 7.80-7.84, until the recent decline in Hong Kong dollar interest rate, with the expansion of the United States dollar spread, may attract the market for Hong Kong dollar, buy the US dollar encumbrance activity increased, so that Hong Kong dollar again triggers weak exchange guarantees a period before.
But he believes that with the Hong Kong bank interest rate hike cycle beginning, HK dollar interest rate normalization is underway, and the situation of future HK dollar interest rates below the US dollar interest rate will change.
"The Hong Kong dollar interest rate will be more aligned with the U.S. dollar interest rate trend, and we must be more careful in managing risks, prepared to cope with market fluctuations."
Since the Hong Kong dollar is very abundant, the Hong Kong dollar depreciation rate further declined, three-month depreciation fell from 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, with the U.S. dollar spread from 46 basis points to 51 base points; a monthly depreciation reached a five-month low, with the U.S. dollar spreading from 120 bases to 127 foundations.
From May to mid-September, the Hong Kong dollar spot exchange rate was closest to $7.85 to $1 for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the outflow of funds from some of the promotions after the completion of the escrow and large-scale promotion activities, weak exchange guarantees were repeatedly triggered in May and August following the first trigger in April.
The HKMA has purchased and extorted the USD at a level of 7.85 in accordance with the associated exchange rate system to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong exchange rate.
In May and August, the Monetary Authority purchased a total of about HK$52.1 billion under the weak exchange guarantee mechanism.
Is there a new tax law for foreigners?
When the relevant head of the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation asked reporters on the 30th, he said that in order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will consider continuing preferential arrangements for foreign people, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
Reporters asked that the newly revised personal income tax law adjusted our country's individual income tax resident taxpayer determination criteria from one year to 183 days.
Please ask if there are any preferential arrangements for outsiders, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, in the next step when implementing this law?

In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new personal income tax law will consider continuing preferential arrangements for foreign nationals, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
There are no "thresholds" of the moon's center: quality certification promotes improved quality.
With the growth of the "two-child economy" and the prosperity of the mother and baby market, from the north to the three or four lines of cities, various grades of monthly meetings have been established everywhere.
The current very hot months will meet the consumer demand of the masses, charging from tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, but at the same time in an embarrassing situation, this institution has no threshold and there is still a gap in regulation.
The State Administration of Market Supervision recently carried out the 2018 National "Quality Month" series of activities, and journalists visited a five-star lunar center in Tianjin to visit the certification experience of maternal and child care services.
In general, the monthly centers provide neonatal care, nutritional meals, post-natal repair plastics and other services.
In this month's center, the reporter sees that nurses check newborn breastfeeding daily, and professional amulets provide fine care services such as bathing, touching and so on.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from the early wound care of the moon, to mid- and late lunar beauty care services, provide Chinese medicine treatment and beauty care programs, help moms restore my beautiful posture.
A new mother told reporters that she had booked the month before eight months.
The monthly service projects directly affect the comfort of the mother's month and physical recovery, some small monthly meetings can only provide some simple monthly services, there are disinfection and hygiene irregularities, easy to cross infection, diet is a single unscientific problem.
The head of the lunar center said they were the only five-star lunar center in Tianjin to be certified by Class B service.
"Although some customers did not understand the meaning of Level B certification at first, it is important for the long-term development of enterprises to benefit from rigorous and standardized process management through certification.
Pan Lifeng, Deputy Director of the Certification and Supervision Division of the General Administration of National Market Control, said that service certification is based on customer perception, attention to organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics, is an important part of the national quality infrastructure, has a positive role in improving the proportion of quality services supply, enhancing the international competitiveness of Chinese services.
China since 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification program has experienced a process from scratch, gradually developing, emerging such as financial services certification, mother-to-child care service certification, commodity after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, healthcare service certification and so on.
According to the State Administration of Market Supervision statistics, at present there are more than 130 service certification institutions in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 effective certification certificates.
Pan Lifen said that it is necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, gradually expand the coverage of service certification in health, education, sports, finance, e-commerce and other fields, and facilitate supply-side reform and quality improvement in the service industry.
Reuters Hong Kong November 5 - After two consecutive months of falling prices at the top, Hong Kong's financial administration president Chen Delin said on Monday that it is time to observe whether the city has entered the downside cycle and if confirmed, can consider the tightening policy of subsequent relaxing counter-cyclical measures in due course.
Chen de Lin also pointed out that if the price of the building is adjusted, the first time it will be affected by people who are going to work at the peak of the construction market, but it is expected such as a sharp fall in the price of the Asian financial storm in 1997, and citizens have a low chance of selling property.
Chen delin led a number of senior members of the Financial Regulatory Commission to attend the Legislative Council briefing, saying that if it is confirmed that the building market enters the downturn cycle, there can be continuous relaxation when appropriate.
"But now we see only a few weeks of data, relaxing is still too early, and there is still more time to see whether the building market enters the downside cycle."
Since 10th of 2009, the Monetary Authority has introduced eight reverse cycle measures to significantly tighten mortgages for various types of properties, including lowering the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to pass rigorous pressure tests, etc. in order to improve banking risk management and seismic resistance.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest rate hike cycle, the price index for all-Hong Kong private residential buildings in August and September fell two consecutive months, with a monthly decline to 1.44% in September.
But the cumulative increase in the first three quarters of this year is still 10.2%.
According to HKMA data, the financial situation of households measuring Hong Kong's seismic ability to cope with financial risks is still healthy, in the second quarter of this year, there are 66% unsecured homeowners in Hong Kong, which is higher than the average of 60% in 2009-11; the average number of newly issued mortgages and new granted loans and interest rates are 47% and 34%, respectively, compared with 64% and 41% respectively in 2009-11.
But Chen Delin said that the high seismic resistance does not mean that already employed citizens will not suffer from economic downturn, because the property valuation will fall, and people who buy buildings in peak times will be the first to rush.
While the Monetary Authority tightens bank lending to mortgage lenders, mortgage lenders can also obtain high-performing mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or by developers.
Chen Delin said that now, together with mortgage loans to developers, the number of borrowers can reach 85-90%, if the price falls by one percent, there will be negative assets (i.e. property market value drops below the level of total outstanding mortgage loans).
However, Nguyen Guoheng, vice president of the HKMA, said authorities estimate that developers provide high-value mortgages, accounting for only 2-2.5% of bank mortgages, still low.
At the peak of Hong Kong's negative assets in 2003, there were more than 100,000 cases of negative assets, accounting for 22% of supplyers.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets in seven consecutive quarters.

The systemic red plaque lupus is a chronic and difficult condition that affects the entire body's plagiarism, which has been considered "incurable" in the past.
Because of its lesion mechanism is unknown, diagnosis and difficulty, lack of effective treatment methods can not be rooted.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at Tsinghua University's School of Life Sciences and the director of the Rheuminous Immunological Center at Peking University, found that human immunoglobulins have molecular variants that increase the susceptibility of systemic red plaque lupus, and this variation is involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, both teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body is an important cause of systemic red plaque lupus.
According to one of the authors of the article, Sun Xiaolin, North Great People's Hospital, chestnut country team collected nearly 2000 large samples of systemic patients with red plaque lupus and conducted research, found that in patients with immunoglobulin variant have produced pathogenic cells and a wide variety, a large number of autoantibodies, renalitis, arthritis, pulp meningitis, vascularitis and other inflammation incidence and severity significantly increased.
Liu Wanli's team discovered the immune signaling pathway activated by this immune molecular variation, and promoted the pathogenic mechanism of B cells to secrete a variety of autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the two teams are strong and united, fully fulfilling their respective advantages, achieved a close bond between basic research and clinical applications.
Liu Wanli's team is committed to the study of B lymphocyte immunorecognition and immune activation, while Chestnut-King national team has long been engaged in clinical research on systemic red plaque lupus.
"This study is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and for the first time in academia to institutionalize that immune globulin gene abnormalities will trigger systemic red plaque lupus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment."
This is not short-term care, but in accordance with the law.
The lawyer carries an axe to court?
At first the news was indeed very irritating, and it also exploded in the legal circle.
The law of Fujian Quanzhou City subsequently fined 500 yuan to the lawyer involved, and writtenly advised the Qianzhou City Bar Association to investigate and deal with it.
According to the Xinjing News report, a formal briefing by the Quanzhou City Law Enforcement Association said that the two lawyers' actions did not involve illegal violations and were not punishable under the law.
From a number of reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou Municipal Law Council is not short-term or confrontational, but has been recognized by the Qianzhou Central Court.
An event that might have triggered tensions within the legal community would eventually be properly resolved.
The reversal of the situation stems from a more complete restoration of truth: the axe carried by an attorney with the same type and model as the defendant's murder weapon, but not scratched, only in the proof-of-fact process to provide auxiliary evidence, without intimidating actions or subjective intent to "jeopardize the security of the court".
There are four very important details to consider whether or not the actions of a lawyer involved in violation of law and violations: first, the local court has previously held two sessions, only presented an axe photo, from the point of view of defense, showing the axe originals is necessary; secondly, the axe was purchased one hour before the meeting, not lawyers unwilling to seek the consent of the judge, but objectively unable to contact the judge; thirdly, the whole axe was not used excessively or improperly; and fourthly, the interlocutor publicly recognized the fault for the first time and apologised to the court.
Consolidating these circumstances, it can be seen that the lawyer involved "to bring an axe in court" is not malpractice, just for defense.
After clarifying the whole fact, the Quanzhou City Law Association did not smooth the boat, but borne pressure to make a decision not to punish.
This decision also withstands the test of fact and law.
As for bringing an axe as a control tool to the court without permission from the court, it is indeed easy to cause unease and misunderstanding.
For safety and prudence considerations, the previous fines and judicial recommendations of the Quanzhou Central Court are also inexorable.
In order to safeguard the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from harassing lawyers, the Supreme Law in 2014 issued the Rules for Security Inspection of the People's Court Judicial Police.
Since the rule has been promulgated, many lawyers have taken the example of a few incidents that are jeopardizing the security of the Tribunal due to security breaches.
In such very individual cases as the state of Spring, communication in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding is not difficult to eliminate.
The Bar Association, as a self-discipline organization in the lawyer's profession, undertakes a dual mission of punitive and legal protection.
In the past, individual law-making organizations have been criticized for their bias towards chastising, failing to guarantee.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association, from the point of view of the process or results, is commendable, and sets an example for more legal associations to perform their correct duties.
On October 1, what taxes will affect our money bags?
Xinhua News Agency Shanghai October 1, 2019 New personal income tax law will come into effect on January 1, 2019, in order to allow the majority of people to enjoy the tax reduction dividend as early as possible, from October 1, the actual wages and salaries earned by taxpayers will be deducted at the starting point of $5,000 a month, and apply the new tax rate scale.

A tripartite trade deal between the US and Mexico will bring new opportunities to 500 million people.
According to foreign media reports, a joint statement by Canada's Foreign Minister Friland and U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer published on the Canadian government website said that the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a tripartite trade deal, which would be called "USMCA" (the three-nation agreement between the two countries).
Earlier, Canadian CTV News quoted senior U.S. sources as saying that Canada and the United States had bridged their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post, citing two informative sources, reported that the agreement between the United States and Canada on September 30 would retain NAFTA as a tripartite trade deal, with the three heads of state signing new agreements within two months.
"Today, Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed to a new trade deal - the U.S.MCA (USMCA), which will provide high-standard trade deals for our workers, farmers and companies that will lead to more free markets, fairer transactions, and more sustainable economic growth."
The current NAFTA was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
After Trump took office, he announced plans to revisit the agreement and sign a new deal.
The three countries started this negotiation process in 2017.
Early Okinawa communique elections due to the death of an ex-commissar and ambitious ambitions were announced in the early morning of local time, and Yucheng Danny, who opposed the relocation plan for Japanese and American military bases, was successfully elected.
The election was counted on September 30, and the final results showed that Yucheng received a total of 396.632 thousand votes, making it the largest in Okinawa County's history of knowing elections, with more than 80,000 votes than its main campaign opponent Zoe Shinjuku.
A total of four candidates participated in the election with a vote rate of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa County Knowledge Election.
Yucheng told the media on the 1st day that the results of the election showed that the county people did not want to let Mr. Hung know about his efforts, he will continue to work with the Japanese government and the U.S. government on anti-theft plans for the relocation of American military bases and the closure of the all-time base.
The U.S. military base is located in the city of Ino Bay, Okinawa County, and has long been criticized by the Japanese and American government for having previously agreed to relocate it to the wild ancient areas of the town's name, but the people of Okinawa strongly objected that they would be able to completely relocate the base from Okinawa.
With regard to the relocation plan strongly opposed by the county people and the request to withdraw permission for landfilling on the ancient shores of the wilderness, Yucheng said that he did not stand in opposition and divisive positions with the central government at first, hoping that the two sides will fully exchange views and demonstrate the intention to resolve through consultation.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning that he would take this result seriously and will make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and ease the burden on the base.
Japan's chief official, Song Yiwei, said at a press conference on January 1 that the government's approach to relocating U.S. military bases as soon as possible had not changed.
At the same time, he also expressed his desire to negotiate with Yucheng.
Yucheng will officially take office in Okinawa County on the 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds grew, North Dakota farmer Paul Thomas has grown more and more soybeans in his land.
This shift peaked this year and he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans in 5,000 acres to an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to replant staple crops in the U.S. agricultural area before 2019: corn and wheat.
U.S. farmers planted more soybeans than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The plan to replant other food crops is because in the context of President Trump's trade war against China, U.S. farmers are facing a dilemma for selling soybeans.
China usually buys about 60% of U.S. exports of soybeans, but because of the trade war, almost zero purchases of U.S. soybeans in recent months led to soy prices falling to a ten-year low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping that he can earn more by reducing reliance on crops that depend on China's demand.
Thomas says soy prices are "a painful blow to us."
He said there was no need for China to buy, and soybean spot prices near its farms were $7.10 per bushel, while the cost of coverage required was $8.50.
U.S. farmers recorded a record high in soybean cultivation this year, and harvests are also expected to hit a record high.
Just at such an easily stunned moment, they were hit by a trade war.
In response to Trump's tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China imposed import duties on imports of U.S. soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will publish its first estimate of the area to be planted next year, which will include considerations for the impact on tariffs.
This projection is expected to confirm the civilian agency's expectation of a reduction in soybean seeding area.
According to a report seen by Reuters, Informata Economics forecasts an increase of 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) in maize cultivation in 2019 and a reduction of 7% to 83 million acres in soybean cultivation.
Informa also expects that wheat cultivation in the U.S. will increase by 4%.
Soy soybeans planted before retaliatory tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, about 15 million more than a decade ago.
The area of corn cultivation has increased by less than 5 million acres since 2008 to 89.1 million acres, and this year's wheat cultivation is 47.8 million acres, close to its lowest level in 100 years.
Aaron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Farming Association, owns a total area of 3,600 acres and nearly half of it is used to grow soybeans this year but plans to cut in the future.
He said it could increase maize cultivation by up to 20% on his farm in northern Illinois; the state is the largest soybean planting state in the United States.
Soy production per acre is lower than corn, but less fertilizer is needed, which makes soybeans generally cheaper to grow.
If farmers move to end-of-life corn, the cost may increase but will benefit a number of businesses including Andersons Inc's fertilizer salesmen.
Patrick Bowe, executive director of Andersons, told Reuters that he expected the replanting of corn would be conducive to fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from farmers' re-sewing of corn.
Sutilawa, director of Hongman airport management in Bangkok, Thailand, held a press conference on 29 April to apologize for an incident involving a Chinese citizen at the airport and said that Thailand welcomes Chinese tourists.
On the 27th, Loungman airport security guard clashed with a Chinese man who was denied entry.
Sutilawa said that the actions of the security forces involved were serious irregularities and that the airport administration had suspended him from office and established a commission of inquiry to investigate the matter in accordance with procedures, which would quit the security services if it was true.
Thailand's immigration agency has now arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
Sutilawa apologized for the incident that undermined Thailand's image, and said it attached great importance to the matter and was willing to do everything possible to reduce the impact of the incident on tourists who were beaten and would send a letter of apology to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said that Langman Airport is willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand, and the United Thai Immigration Service has established special entry routes for Chinese tourists in Bangkok's Suwannap, Luongman, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Huihai and other five Thai international airports.
He said that the next step will be to rectify the area of landing signs, specify the cost of landing tickets, and improve the quality of service and communication capabilities of staff.
After the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learned about this, contacted the parties for the first time to understand what happened.
At the same time, a communication was made with the head of the Thai Immigration Bureau, Airport Authority and Tourism Sports Department to ask the Thai side to thoroughly investigate the incident, severely punish the perpetrators, and will continue to maintain close communication with the Thai side, properly handle the matter, and safeguard the legal interests of the parties.
Xinhua International Times Review: Defend multilateralism, China understands unity.
In the midst of a reversal of unilateralism, international rules and multilateral order have been stunned.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism has entered a critical period.
As a responsible big country, China is working with the international community to uphold multilateralism and promote multilateralism continuously.
Faced with the new situation and challenges, China makes a loud voice on the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Secretary of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi said in his speech at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly, multilateralism in the new era should adhere to the goal of win-win cooperation, based on rules and order, with a focus on fairness and justice, and driven by effective action.
At the same time, China calls for building a global pattern of development cooperation based on the United Nations as its core, North-South cooperation as its main channel and complementing South-South cooperation, and calls upon all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflect the mainstream of the international community.
As Espinosa, President of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly, said that "the United Nations needs to promote multilateralism and uphold a rule-based international system more than ever."
International Monetary Fund President Lagarde said the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultations.
In recent years, with the adjustment of the comparison of global economic and political forces, a number of emerging market and developing country groups have emerged, playing a greater role in international major multilateral mechanisms, providing new impetus to multilateralism.
Standing on this dimension consideration, China advocates the construction of a large family rather than clapping small circles, adhere to the principles of multilateralism such as co-working and co-building rather than winning people's food, conforming to the trend of the times, is an inevitable choice to deal with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common claims of most countries in the world.
There are advanced ideas and more solid actions.
China's Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China's international and regional cooperation initiatives such as the "Belt and Road Initiative", the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, 16+1 Cooperation, promote international regional cooperation, improve complementarity with existing international institutions and order, bring innovative vitality to multilateralist cooperation, and contribute to advancing the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As defenders of the international order and practitioners of multilateralism, China's actions are becoming increasingly powerful in the United Nations on this multilateral stage.
Good offices for international hotspots, addressing climate change, engaging in peacekeeping operations, making efforts to reduce poverty and alleviate poverty, and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As Secretary-General Guterres said, China has become an important pillar of multilateralism.
When the world's "trust deficit" increases and populism and polarization trends rise, it is the moment when the world needs multilateral cooperation most urgently.
At such a historic juncture, the international community must work together to translate consensus into action, firmly defend multilateralism and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

5th "Personal Impairment Month" to Focus on Sexual Education for Disabled Teens - Xinhua
In recent years, the topic of sexual education for young people in China has been widely discussed, but the challenge is still difficult for disabled teenagers.
Recently, the comprehensive sexual education challenges and practical strategies workshop for persons with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How sex education for children and young people with disabilities is an important topic of this seminar.
The report on sexual related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of disabled children and young people in China shows that the proportion of disabled children is more sexually harassed and sexually assaulted than healthy children.
For children and adolescents with disabilities, more attention is also given to "sexual protection" in society.
This seminar aims to explore the promotion of comprehensive sexual education for children with disabilities and adolescents in China from the three aspects of family support, school education and institutional services, providing support to children with disabilities and adolescents from the source, so that they can enjoy their right to self-love as others.
Experts believe that for a long time, the Chinese social public's awareness of disabled groups has remained on an insufficiently in-depth level.
Affected by factors such as traditional ideas, China's comprehensive sexual education for persons with disabilities, especially children and adolescents with disabilities, is not sufficiently in-depth.
However, in recent years, with the support of UNESCO and public welfare people, sexual and reproductive health education practices and implementation paths have been well-developed for Chinese disabled people throughout their entire cycle.
The report shows that children and young people with visual, hearing, intellectual and limbic disabilities may have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding of intimacy than the general population, but overall they have developed to be convenient and enriching.
The Symposium on Comprehensive Sexual Education Challenges and Practical Strategies for Persons with Disabilities was hosted by the Shanghai People's Public Welfare Foundation, jointly supported by the UNESCO Office in China, the International Federation of Disabled Persons (France) Beijing representative office and the United Nations Population Fund representative office in China. In order to develop a comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education practice and implementation path within the context of Healthy China Grand Strategy, policymakers, educators, researchers, social service organizations, parents representatives and other stakeholders in the field of special and integrated education are encouraged to understand the international policies regarding comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of children and young people with disabilities.
Reuters Beijing, September 30 - China's central bank on Sunday announced the planned short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets data show that by the end of August this year, the central bank's foreign currency has been zero for its long-term and futures contracts for 12 consecutive months.
The central bank's previous data showed that by the end of last August, the central bank held a total foreign currency short position of $6.044 billion on its forward-looking and futures contracts, which is unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the short-head position valued at SDR (special drawing rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the central bank's long-term foreign exchange position has been zero.
The data was first published by the central bank at the end of March 2016; it showed that in late February 2016, the central bank's foreign currency had a more than $2.438 billion position on its forward-looking and futures contracts with $289 million.
For the first time, September data released at the end of October showed a net increase of $16.401 million to $45.301 million.
The central bank has previously said that the foreign currency's long-term and futures short position on the domestic currency mainly reflects the FX forwarding operation of the central bank with commercial banks to meet the requirements of corporate foreign currency liabilities hedging, will continue to provide long-term safekeeping products in accordance with the principle of real demand, and the central bank's long-term operations have less impact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20, this year, on the K158 trains, a Joe classmate in Zhengzhou to read the Big Three took a car to the crane.

From the perspective of public opinion, although most of the final result is that the hegemony has been condemned by the public, administrative punishments in the public security department, and even included in the integrity blacklist, the public still feels not "unhappiness": why not let the hegemony be punished on the spot?
Why can't he stop his immoral or even illegal actions on the spot and punish them afterward?
And the unreasonable behavior of the "hegemony master", how can only a male passenger "unbearable" to drag it away?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with policemen, and short-distance trains generally do not exist; even if there are policemen, they worry about the possible arrogant reaction of the hegemony without taking mandatory withdrawal measures.
Repeated hegemony events have made people realize that it is necessary to force the helmsman on the spot to be taken away from or even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This requires that our train troopers dare to take strong measures in time, and trains without policemen should be configured as soon as possible to ensure timely stopping and combating violations.

Activate rural consumption, rely on the normalization mechanism to clean up the market, guide healthy consumption needs, and enhance the sense of farmers' consumption.
According to the data, the consumption potential of rural residents continues to be released, and retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5% in the first half of this year, up 1.3 percentage points from cities.
In a poor village in a western county to visit, the whole village has only one convenience store, entering the store, some goods seem to have met, "Golden Dragonfish" labeled "golden dragon oil", "Wangchai" became "wong milk", "the cottage" many goods.
Over the years, similar phenomena have often been exposed, some rural fake and bad goods are named cards, names are similar, packaging is similar, falsifying, insurmountable.
A consumer survey published in a western city shows that the problem of rural merchants is serious, 66% of users bought counterfeit goods in supermarkets off the country line, including more than half of food.
The relevant departments rectify the rural market, shouting year after year, why is "Lee Ghost" still unstoppable?
Unlike the urban market, farmers' awareness of defending rights is relatively weak, coupled with a lot of rural remoteness, in blind areas where regulatory power is insufficient, so that fake and bad goods can nourish the soil.
A commodity multi-head pipe, some departmental pipe price, some pipe production, some pipe market, function crossover, year after year forfeiture, centralized management of a wind, counterfeit hide from the wind, and slowly come out, just finished old fake, new fake again.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanism, the rural market is difficult to purify, the illegal cost is low, and the interests are large, causing some illegal traffickers to stir up the "uphill and downland" twisted mind, some rural areas become a "disposal market".
From saturation to well-being, the majority of farmers are moving towards developing consumption.
Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued "A number of opinions on improving the institutional mechanism for promoting consumption to further stimulate the consumer potential of residents", which proposed to promote the upgrading of rural residents' consumption ladders, with the aim of making the majority of farmers "able to consume" "will be consumed" "daring to consume", so that rural consumption really flourishes.
On the one hand, we should deepen the reform and eliminate many barriers to market regulation and management shortcomings, due to locality, improve food safety, product quality supervision network, and continuously reduce the space for rural counterfeiting and selling counterfeit.
On the other hand, it is necessary to increase law enforcement and regulate "macular blood vessels", and do not allow counterfeiting and corruption in rural areas to spread.
Strict punishment of pit farmers is the caregiver, no matter how much concealed the falsifier hides, it should not be a reason for the breeding of false and bad goods, the relevant departments should clearly define their duties, the grassroots regulatory power sinking, which link issues, to hold accountable, let the falsified and solder there are no hiding places.
Strictly check the market access, impose strict qualifications on the producers and operators, keep the market circulation closed, let the products come straight, go clear, find a way from the source and roots, make legitimate distributors safe to operate, so that farmers can buy reassurance.
Activate rural consumption to guide healthy consumption needs.
With the upgrading of consumption, many farmers not only pursue a saturation and eating well, but also pursuit of culture, health and other high-quality life, can not equate the rural market with "low quality" "cheap" painting.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce coverage to the vast majority of rural areas, open two-way sales channels between urban and rural areas, promote the integration of offline industrial development platforms and online e-commerce trading platforms, support the expansion of new consumer business models into the rural market; promote the conditions for townships to integrate commercial and trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing and other organic combinations; improve the modern rural circulation network system, optimize the integration of inventory facilities resources, effectively reduce the cost of rural circulation.
To create a clear and reassuring market environment for the countryside, so that farmers do not worry about their consumption, rural consumption can be more and more prospering, to improve the sense of acquisition and happiness of farmers' consumption.
Since November 1, China has reduced some of the most-favoured-nation tariff rates for goods, and the total level of tariffs will be reduced to 7.5%.
According to the decision of the 26th Standing Meeting of the State Council, the Committee on Tariff Tax Rules of the State Council issued an announcement on March 30, and since November 1, 2018, it will reduce the most-favoured-nation tax rate for some goods.

At the same time, with the overall level of tariffs, especially for medicines and consumer goods imports, the tariff rate is accordingly lowered.
In order to follow up on the implementation of the decision-making deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported medicines from May 1 this year, since July 1 reduced import duties on automobiles and parts, and some consumer goods for daily use, and implemented the third step tax reduction in information technology agreements.
The reporter learned from the State Council Committee on Tariff Tax Rules that since this year, after several successive independent adjustments, China's total tariff level will fall from 9.8% to 7.5% last year, with an average drop of 23%.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs will facilitate the balanced development of foreign trade, promote a higher level of opening-up to the outside world, and also contribute to the integrated use of both international and domestic resources in order to advance structural reforms at the domestic supply side.
The relevant head of the committee said that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, initiative to reduce the total level of tariffs is the practical action of General Secretary Xi Jinping in the spirit of an important speech at the Boao Forum on Asia, as well as China's own high-quality development needs to further expand openness and expansion of imports. This action and initiative shows that China will firmly pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy, while strengthening its own development momentum, but also to make China's development better for the world.
On September 29, the regional public brand announcement of "environmental and rural people" agricultural products in Gansu Province will be held in Tianjin Nankai District.
Red Army mink, black beans, mountain children's pastoral songs of Montenegrin goats, exquisite buckwheat tea, paper-cut films, pure handmade slippers... a piece of finely packaged agricultural products is placed on the stands, they have a common brand name called "Range and Villagers".
"Creating a regional brand of 'circular people' has effectively solved the development bottlenecks of'multi-dispersed, small and weak' agricultural products in circles and counties, and is also a powerful vehicle for fighting poverty." On 29th, Gansu County hosted the Regional Public Brand Launch of 'Circular People' Agricultural Products at Nankai District Tianjin City.
Ring County is located at the crossroads of Shaanxi Ganning three provinces, as "the national advanced food production county", "China's small and sloppy food country," "China's leather and shadow country", a long history, resource accumulation.
Lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat face, lamb face soft and other places snacks are often remembered by the tourists in his country.
As the level of urbanization in China continues to improve, the urban population is rapidly increasing, and a large number of rural young people leave their hometowns to start urban life.
China's agricultural brand research expert Yang Xiaojia said: "Now the pace of urban life is fast and stressful, more and more people begin to miss rural life as a child, but, 'the most beautiful memory is in the countryside', 'rounder' brand design is named after the national conditions and grievances of people who flounder around the county outside.
The climatic conditions of the ring and county are special, long sunshine time, large differences in day and night temperature, with unique characteristics of small and mixed food planting conditions.
The domestic production of more than 20 small miscellaneous grains, is the country of China's small miscellaneous grains, production is the leader of Gansu, and quality is in the forefront of the country.
Wang Xiaoli is a young woman in Tianjin to attend the seminar as a volunteer, she said: "The most dear people of the hometown, the best taste of the hometown, the 'round country' brand has drawn up our too many sorrows and memories, remembering not forgetting more food there, hoping that the 'round country' brand will go further, the bigger it will be."
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the National Food and Materials Reserve Board of Science Research Institute, said that by testing more than 900 sets of indicators data, various detection data for agricultural products such as buckwheat, buckwheat, black beans and other crops in the county highlight, many physiologically active substances in mixed grains are higher than standard data, "the rural people" has an inherent advantage to capture domestic high-end mixed grain markets.
Jiangxi County Committee Secretary Chai Chun said that through the release of the "Zhongjiang people" brand, it can further improve the quality, standardization, scaled innovation and development level of high-quality agricultural products in Jiangsu Province, which is conducive to shaping a good overall image of China's rural agriculture, and rapidly improving its visibility, competitiveness and added value.
Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.2% in July compared to the previous month, an increase above expectations, which warmed the market's expectation of a rate hike for the Bank of Canada next month.
If the rate hike is real, it will be the fifth time in more than a year for the central bank to raise interest rates.
Analysts who visited Reuters previously forecast a 0.1% increase.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries were growing.
The data is noteworthy because the central bank earlier this month anticipated that temporary factors could drag on third-quarter GDP data.
Bank of Canada President Poloz promised on Thursday that the central bank will continue to gradually raise interest rates and will closely monitor economic data.
The next time the Bank of Canada announces its interest rate will be announced on October 24.
Due to Canada's economic growth and near record low unemployment, the Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Kaifeng Macron, said the country's third-quarter GDP growth is expected to reach around 2%.
"This will be higher than the 1.5% expected by the Bank of Canada, and thus become another reason for expecting a rate hike next month," he said in a report.
The overnight index exchange shows that the market's forecast for the ECB rate hike in October has risen from 76.46% to 78.27%.
For the first time in 65 years, the Koreans jointly visited Hanjiang into the seagate.
South Korea's Ministry of Defense confirmed on Friday that the Korean side launched a joint visit to Haikou waters in Hanjiang and Linjin River on the same day.
The initiative is a pre-emptive preparation to guarantee the free navigation of civil vessels on both sides.
The announcement provided to the media on the same day by the South Korean Defense Ministry shows that this is the first time since the 1953 Armistice Agreement between the two sides has conducted a joint visit to the Haikou of Hanjiang.
In September of this year, the North and South Korea signed a military agreement that agreed to jointly explore waters such as Hanjiang into the sea口 in November to ensure future environmental protection and development of tourism.
In October, the Koreans planned a joint expedition to the waters during general-level meetings.
On November 5, a joint inspection of the Korean and Korean waters was officially launched.
The joint mission consists of 20 Korean military and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Defense, in this visit, both personnel did not carry weapons and prohibited the use of words and actions that stimulated each other.
"Because there is no military demarcation near the sea crossing, the area was an unexpectedly high-altitude zone, but through joint inspections it will become a new peace zone in the future."
The total area of the joint Korean-Korean exploration is about 70 km long, with a total area of about 280 km2.
South Korea's Defense Ministry said it will send six ships to detect the depth of seawater and so on, providing basic information for safe navigation in the waters; as soon as the investigation is completed, a navigational map will be provided for civilian vessels.
In October 2007, North Korea held a summit meeting in Pyongyang to reach an agreement on the joint use of Hanjiang and Linjin River into the seagate, but subsequent negotiations were stranded due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to a military agreement signed in September by the Koreans, future ships of both sides need to inform each other in advance before navigating in common waters.
According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia on Nov. 5, recently, Chinese citizens Guo Yucheng and Maun Xin lost ties during Mongo Tourism.
It is understood that the two men are blue sky rescue team members, on October 19, the two people contacted their domestic relatives and friends, saying they will immediately go to the mountains near Lake Kusugur, and share their location through WeChat, after which they have lost contact.
The Chinese Embassy in Mongolia has always attached great importance to protecting the legitimate rights and security of Mongolian citizens, and attaches great importance to consular protection and assistance.
After learning the above two tourists disconnected news, the embassy immediately launched a consular insurance emergency plan, trying to seize the golden rescue time and fully work.
The Embassy maintains close communication with the family of the parties, assists families to immediately report cases to the police and provides them with a list of translations for choice.
For the first time, the embassy met with the head of the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Relations, the Directorate General of Police and Emergency Situations, to inform about the situation, requested the Mongol side to conduct search and rescue as soon as possible, and maintain close communication with the Mongol side throughout the search and rescue process, ensuring that the latest progress is timely.
At the same time, the embassy assisted families in revealing people's events and launched a wide range of actively seeking people in Mon Chinese and Chinese enterprises, provided effective clues, and provided relevant assistance to several blue sky rescue team members who were assisting in rescue.
Under the strong impetus of the embassy, Montaigne dispatched a rescue team for the first time and promised to waive search and rescue costs.
The Directorate-General of Police and the Department of Emergency Situations instructed the police and emergency departments in Kusugur province to conduct full search and rescue.
Due to the fact that Lake Kusugur is located in the northern border of Mongolia with Russia, it is remote, widely dispersed, transportation and communication extremely inconvenient, and now Mongolia has entered a severe winter, temperatures are low to about 20 degrees below zero, local police and emergency departments have overcome huge difficulties, almost all the police force, and launched local herders, through horse riding, walking, visiting herders, etc., carpet search and rescue on a wide range of days around the two people's unconnected position.
At the same time, in view of the special situation in the pastoral areas, Monfondo has been publishing people's revelations through the broadcasting cycle for many days.
The relevant staff of the domestic Blue Sky Rescue Team have also come to Mongolia and actively participate in the rescue.
The safety of the two unconnected people has always touched our hearts.
To date, the two have been disconnected for more than 10 days and the embassy has received some clues, but they have not yet been found, and search and rescue operations are still under strain.
The embassy will always follow the principle of "people-oriented", continue to pay attention to this matter, promote Mongolia's continued full search and rescue and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties.
The embassy calls on compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia, if they learn about the relevant clues, please contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia for the first time.
Former bodyguard claims Michael Jackson puts tape on his nose for headlines
Michael Jackson's former bodyguard claims that the late singer deliberately made some odd acts intended to intentionally incite the media.
Matt Felds, now a real estate developer and owner of the martial arts/dance chain, told The Metropolitan Times that Jackson believed that if he was no longer an "mystery" in the eyes of the public, his personal fascination would cease.
In order to get on top of the news, he reportedly wore a mask and taped on his own nose in order to spark heated debate.
We'll tell you the real thing. You can have your own opinion.
"He knows how to manipulate the media. He fully knows how to make headlines," said Fides, who made Jackson's 10-year bodyguard. "The approach works in 90% of cases by wearing a mask on his face, or sticking with a tape on his hand, or sticking it onto his nose."
He added: "The result is disobedience, and this is very sad."
Fides also talked about allegations of child sexual abuse by Wade Robson and James Sefchak against Jackson, which have been aired in the controversial Emmy Award-winning documentary "Leaving Dream Island".
Robson and Sefchak both claimed they had been harassed by Jackson as a child for years.
Fides claims: "The whole pedophile is bullshit... this guy has multiple girlfriends and has a legal marriage with Lisa Marie Presley, which is his life."
He claims that Jackson's abuse of children at Dream Island ranches is "impossible" because he 'almost' doesn't stay on the farm.
He said: "They say there are several boys around, but that's not the case."
Jackson's winery denied all charges against the deceased star, who denies all charges against him before his death in 2009.
The government has 15 tax officials retiring due to corruption.
New Delhi:
In the fourth round of action to combat corrupt and other malfeasance, the government forced another 15 tax officials to retire.
According to article 56 (J) of the Basic Rules, the Central Indirect Tax and Customs Commission responsible for supervising taxes on goods and services and import duties imposes a mandatory requirement that 15 senior officials retire due to corruption and other charges.
This is the fourth round of dismissal of corrupt tax officials since June this year, with a total of 49 high-ranking tax officers in the first three rounds being forced to retire, including 12 officials from the Central Direct Tax Commission.
Sources said the move was in line with Prime Minister Modi's address to the nation in Red Fort, when Modi said that some of the tax sector's victims could abuse power, harass taxpayers, or take excessive action against honest assessors or minor or procedural irregularities.
"We have recently taken strong measures to force a significant number of tax officials to retire and we will not tolerate such behavior," he said.
Nearly half of retired officials are those arrested by the Indian Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly receiving illegal benefits. One was arrested for bribery of Rs 15,000.
In June, the government forced 15 central indirect tax and customs committee commissioners to retire on charges of corruption, bribery, smuggling or even collusion. Prior to this year, the Government had enforced the retirement of 12 high-ranking officials of the State Revenue Service under section 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (Suspension) Rules for corruption, sexual harassment, and large amounts of unknown assets.
In August, the government forced 22 officials of the Central and Central Commission on indirect taxes and customs to retire. Article 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (Retirement) Rules of 1972 provides for a periodic review of the performance of public civil servants in order to determine whether they should remain or retire in the public interest.
Under these provisions, the situation of government employees under Articles 56(J), 56(1) or 48(1)(b) of the Basic Rules of 1972 shall be reviewed in accordance with the circumstances referred to in Article 56(J) of the 1972 Basic Rules and pursuant to Article 56(1) of the Basic Rules or Article 48 of the Central Public Service (Suspension) Rules for a period of 30 years before they reach the age of 50-55.
A Maine Woman Gets 500 Letters From Joint Health Insurance In Five Days
Stephanie Ray said her mailbox was ripped up from Thursday to Monday by a letter from the insurance company.
"The first wave started last Thursday and I received 46 letters," she told CNN. "I immediately called Joint Health Insurance and informed them that I had received 46 identical letters."
But the letter was followed, with more than 500 copies as of Monday.
The letters were sent to her son who lived in a private nursing home with autism, she explained. But when the letter was scrapped, it did not mention her son's name, but rather "the respected Minneapolis Department of Health and Public Services - Cincinnati," she told local media.
These letters are all claims for $54 or $0 outside the scope of joint health insurance coverage, Ms. Ray said.
When she asked why the joint health insurance company had received a large pile of letters, she was told that it was due to coding problems, she said.
In its statement, the Joint Health Insurance Company informed CNN that they were tackling this problem and could not provide more details given privacy requirements.
"We have identified the root causes of the problem. We deeply apologize for the incident, we have contacted the family and asked about their situation," the health insurance company said.
Ms. Ray said there was a message at the bottom of each letter calling people to achieve paperlessness. "I think these letters they sent wereted half the trees of the forest," she said.
Antonio Brown says he's not yet ready for retirement
Antonio Brown said he would not retire from the National Rugby League, and just a few days ago he trumpeted on Twitter that he had left the National Rugby League.
The four-time full-time receiver tweeted on Thursday: "I'm in very good condition now, why am I going to retire right now."
He was released by the New England Patriots after playing a game last week. In the last six months, Antonio Brown had been abandoned by three different teams.
Brown, who lost Nike sponsor status last week, said he would start from Miami and train one day a week in high school.
31-year-old Brown also had a tweet with Los Angeles Rams security guard Eric Wedell, who often fought him during the Baltimore Ravens.
HSBC Bank Converts Crime Testing Tools to Open New Business
HSBC Holdings has transformed the algorithm used to detect financial crime into a means of opening up new business opportunities, which was previously forced to be established by money laundering scandals, the bank's head said.
The system combines relevant data on customer banking and corporate ownership with public data on directorial positions, marking the right potential customers for HSBC bank employees and providing ways to contact them through existing customer relationships.
HSBC's overall revenue strategy is to seek greater returns from its massive physical network and customer data, and the use of data and artificial intelligence to try to increase revenues is an integral part of this strategy.
"This is the first time that investment in financial crime prevention has been used for commercial purposes, and such a pioneering business is inherently low risky and efficient," said Stewart Nevisen, global head of HSBC Customer Network Bank.
HSBC declined to disclose how much the new system is expected to bring, but said the overall "network gain" initiative has generated hundreds of millions of additional gains.
This is also an important step in HSBC's efforts to maintain its global business, as some analysts and investors have previously said the bank should cut down or exit markets that yield less than the cost of money, such as the U.S. market.
In 2012, HSBC reached a $1.9 billion settlement agreement with U.S. authorities for failing to stop drug dealers from money laundering through its Mexican subsidiary. The hundreds of millions of dollars invested in financial crime compliance were part of the deal.
By mapping the relationships between individual customers and companies, searching for unconventional trading patterns, or discovering previously unknown links between them, the system can achieve its original intent.
The system has liberated the workforce of more than 400 employees who do not have to manually check transactions and record them, but take on more customer-oriented service work, said Aderion Rigby, Chief Operating Officer for HSBC Trading.
HSBC's Nivison pointed out that they suddenly realized that as soon as a slight modification of the tool can be used to find "small green flags" for more attractive potential customers, rather than searching for "small red flags" in which violations occurred.
"We acquired customer datasets, combined with (UK) company registry data, and then reversed previous algorithms to find the potential of customers, which could be achieved through registries, corporate development or links to existing customers," Nevisson said.
The tool, which has mapped 22.5 million British entities and individuals, can identify a linked network in three minutes, while bank clerks often take three hours to manually build maps, he said.
Rouhani said Iran was promised that the United States would lift "all" sanctions in exchange for dialogue
European countries are eager to negotiate with Iran, all hinting that if Tehran is willing to engage in a dialogue, the United States will end sanctions against Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, the European signatories of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal urged him to meet U.S. President Donald Trump and pledged that Washington would lift "all" sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
"Three of the six countries - German Prime Minister, British Prime Minister and French President - have insisted on holding this meeting, saying that the United States will lift all sanctions," Iran's president said.
He said he rejected the proposal because negotiations would take place under "the U.S.'s maximum pressure and sanctions on Iran" and could not predict any outcome at all.
Trump quickly denied having provided any relief to Iran and tweeted that Tehran had asked him to lift sanctions as a condition for dialogue, but he "of course" refused.
In his statement, Rouhani also said that many countries expressed support for Iran at one-on-one talks during the United Nations General Assembly. "We discussed a number of issues with all nations who condemned the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and its pressures.
The government initiated a consultation on the review of dog breeding law
Fear of animal control and mismanagement, Scotland's dog breeding law is under review.
The Scottish Government has initiated a consultation to solicit public opinion.
Scotland's Minister of Community Security has pledged to "ensure community security and keep people away from undisciplined owners," with the aim of determining whether there is a need to amend laws against out-of-control dogs.
Scotland's parliamentarian Ash Denam said: "We are conducting two reviews of dog breeding laws because we are absolutely determined to ensure community safety and keep people away from the dishonest dogs owners and their out-of-control dogs.
The consultation aims to seek advice on how to improve the implementation of the 2010 Dog Control Act in Scotland, and next year we will review all dog control laws more broadly to assess whether there is a need for changes.
"Dogs will bring some responsibility, including keeping your dog under effective control, and I encourage everyone interested in this field to respond to our publicity advice."
The polling consultation will continue until January 15, including proposals to strengthen and clarify existing regulations, such as the question of whether a national dog control database should be established.
The Scottish Parliament's post-legislative inspectorate has been hearing testimony from victims and parents of children who have been attacked or killed by dogs, urging the government to review dog breeding laws.
Members of the Scottish Parliament were told that legislation is urgently needed to protect vulnerable groups and children.
The Committee was informed that in Glasgow and Clyde alone, 1,417 people were beaten by dogs to hospital emergency departments last year, including 255 children.
912 people were treated for the National Health Service in Lanarkshire, and 439 persons were treated for the National Health Service in Elshire, both of whom received the highest number in four years.
In July, members of the committee concluded that the current dog-raising law was incompatible with its purpose and called on the Scottish government to conduct a comprehensive review of all dog-raising laws.
The commission's head, Jenny Mara, said: "The Scottish dog law is inconsistent with the purpose. There are still many attacks against children, but existing laws that may prevent these attacks have almost never been enforced or understood."
"It is clear that the current dog-raising law has not come into effect. The current dog-raising law urgently needs reform in order to properly deal with uncontrollable and dangerous dogs, and we can try to build a system for preventing our children from being harmed by dogs."
The consultation, published on the government website Friday, reads as follows: "Uniform and effective law enforcement is key to tackling Scotland-related outlawed dogs."
The review focused on measures that could be taken to assist implementing agencies, such as local authorities, in using their own power to maintain community security.
Saudi Arabia for the first time to provide tourist visas, repealing Abaya robe regulations
Currently, Saudi visas are issued only to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday that it will provide tourist visas for the first time, opening this extremely conservative kingdom to holidaymakers in order to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
The launch of tourism is one of the core elements of the Vision Reform Plan for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for 2030, which aims to prepare the largest Arab economies in the post-oil era.
Just two weeks ago, the U.S. government accused Iran of launching a destructive attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, disrupting the global energy market and raising concerns about broader regional conflicts.
"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," Tourism Director Ahmed Khatib said in a statement.
"Tourists will admire the treasures we share - five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty."
Bloomberg quoted Hatib as saying Saudi Arabia will open online travel visa applications to citizens in 49 countries on Saturday.
Khatib said Saudi Arabia would also relax strict dress regulations for foreign women, allowing them not to wear a wrapped Abaya robe that remains the public apparel that Saudi women must wear.
However, he added that foreign women would be required to wear "simplified clothes," but did not elaborate.
In this desert kingdom with numerous Bedouin remains and archaeological sites, visas are currently restricted to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims who travel to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
Saudi Arabia started issuing temporary visas last year for tourists to take part in sports and cultural events to start the tourism industry, a rare move.
But this serious kingdom prohibits alcohol consumption and has strict social norms that are seen by many as obstacles to tourism.
Prince Mohammed is trying to change the situation through a comprehensive liberalization movement that has brought new cinemas, mixed concerts and sports feasts for Saudi Arabia.
Observers say the international community's criticism of Saudi human rights records, including last year's horrific murder against critic Jamal Khashoggi and crackdown on female activists, could further detract from attracting foreign tourists.
After the Sept. 14 attack by state-owned oil giant Aramco, fears of regional conflicts could also weaken Saudi appeal to holidaymakers.
Due to low oil prices, the government said it hoped tourism would contribute 10% of GDP by 2030, compared with just 3%.
By 2030, Saudi Arabia's goal is to attract as many as 100 million domestic and foreign visitors a year.
But Saudi Arabia currently lacks infrastructure to accommodate so many tourists, and officials estimate that the country will need 500,000 new hotel rooms over the next decade.
The government said tourism is expected to create as many as 1 million tourist jobs in response to high youth unemployment.
Saudi Arabia invests billions of dollars to build tourism from scratch.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia announced a multibillion-dollar project to turn 50 Red Sea islands and other original sites into luxury resorts.
Last year, Kedia's "Entertainment City" construction near Riyadh will include high-end theme parks, motor sports facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historic monuments, such as the hundreds-year-old Madenshale, which is home to sandstone graves left behind by the same civilization that built the city of Petra in Jordan.
Facebook hides the number of "thanks" in Australia's new test
Facebook said today that it has begun to hide the dynamic number of dot "favor" released in Australia, a test designed to ease social pressures and could be replicated globally later.
Today, Australian Facebook users can no longer see the number of dynamic responses and video views released by others, but they can still see other people reacting to their own dynamics.
"We don't want to make people feel like Facebook is a game."
"This time we wanted to test the usage of new versions. We want to take some time to look at user feedback from new versions in order to see if they could be replicated," the company said.
Facebook users around the world are more than a billion, but the social media giant is also under pressure to prevent the platform's impact on their mental health.
According to Australia's cybersecurity commissioner, one in five children in the country report they have been subjected to cyber-violence.
Before making this decision, Facebook tested a version of the hidden citations on another important social media - photo wall in July.
Tests of the wall began in Canada and then extended to Australia, Brazil and several other major user markets.
Facebook said the test was intended to "learn something as soon as possible through a small-scale test."
"While testing of the photo wall has already been carried out, Facebook and (photo wall) are different platforms so we may get different test data," the company said.
The social media giants have not confirmed how long the test will last.
"We'd like to see if deleting the applause would improve the user experience while limiting other positive interactions," said Mia Garrick, Facebook Australia Regional Director.
Lorenzo boosted to Category 4 hurricanes in eastern Caribbean
U.S. National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Lorenzo was upgraded Thursday to Category 4 hurricanes, and the storm's massive waves could impact winding islands and parts of South America.
At 11 p.m. at the National Hurricane Center, the hurricane's eye is located about 1660 miles southwest of the Azores. The eastern summer time is updated. The storm moves north-west and north at a speed of 14 miles per hour with maximum sustained wind speeds of 145 miles per hour.
The storm is not expected to land in the next few days, but Saturday's windward turn northeast could bring Lorenzo closer to the Azores next week. Meteor forecasters predict that the storm will weaken Monday to below level 3.
The storm's massive waves could cause life-threatening waves and tremors to the wind islands and northeast of South America.
Lorenzo is the second 4th or higher-level storm in the Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian reached Level 5 near the Bahamas Islands.
According to Colorado State University meteorologist Philip Klausbach, the Western Hemisphere (including the Atlantic and East Pacific Basin) has produced 16 named storms since August 21.
Phillip Clausbach tweeted: "This is the largest recorded number of named storms in the Western Hemisphere from August 21 to September 21, breaking the old record of 15 named storms created between 1984 and 2002."
Iran's Patriot Missile System Arrested in Saudi Arabia After Attack on Oil Facilities
After routine inspections of Patriot missile batteries at the Turkish military base in Ghaziantep, Turkey, U.S. soldiers debated.
The Pentagon announced Thursday that the U.S. plans to deploy a Patriot missile battery, radar system and about 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia due to an attack on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month.
In a statement, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote that Defense Secretary Mark Esper had "approved an increase in the force to prepare for deployment orders." "While no decision has been taken on additional deployments, they will remain highly alert."
The added force includes two Patriot artillery batteries and a final high-altitude area defense system, also known as the Sad anti-missile system.
The Saad anti-missile system is one of the world's most advanced missile systems, which can target and destroy missiles in the air. Sad intercepted bombs are fired by a launch vehicle to use kinetic energy to "crash down" ballistic threats.
"Importantly, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to regional partners as well as security and stability in the Middle East. Other countries have accused Iran of creating a disaster in the region, but we hope they can help bolster Saudi defense capabilities," Hoffman wrote.
The UN world leader said President Donald Trump has lashed out on Iran's role in attacking Saudi oil facilities. On Tuesday, the U.N. General Assembly said they should press Tehran to engage in diplomatic negotiations.
No responsible government should fund Iran's killings. Sanctions will not be lifted, but only tougher if Iran does not stop its dangerous practices."
On September 14, a strike at the world's largest crude oil processing plant and oil fields forced Saudi Arabia to close half of its manufacturing operations. As a result of the drone attack, crude prices have soared most dramatically in decades and again raised concerns about an outbreak of conflict in the Middle East region. While countries widely believe Tehran should be responsible for the attack, Iran has consistently insisted that it is not involved.
A stunt jumper crashed into a large trailer on the California Highway.
The 28-year-old woman jumped with seven others around 2 p.m. Thursday, California Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Ruben Jones told CNN.
These people took off from the Lodi parachute center, and CNN has contacted the agency for comment.
Jones said the wind was high at the time, and as the parachute team landed near Lodi Airport, the woman crashed into a truck.
Television interviewed Lisa Reyes when the woman crashed, Lisa Reyes was driving on Highway 99 and carrying her father and brother.
She told television: "The man struggled in the wind, but her body landed at a very, very fast pace."
Transfiguration of the central coast disguised as a child rapist is being strangled in front of victims in court
In May 2017, the man wore a set of leaf faux disguises and dragged her back into the bushes as a girl who was only 12 when she traveled to a school on the Central Coast.
He then tied the girl to the tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after his arrest, the police searched one of his residences and found a lot of items related to the uncovering of the case.
The man has accepted seven charges against the attack, and three other charges of seduction and sexual assault committed by the man against another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017 have also pleaded guilty.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a pavement, and when she turned back, saw him suddenly jumping out of the bushes with a large branch and a knife in his hand.
The man was then dressed in a single-handed leaf camouflage suit.
Although the girl repeatedly asked for a man to hold her hand, the man still locked her neck with his hands and hard dragged her into the bushes.
The man said to the girl, "Hush, don't call. Don't call, or don't blame me for being rough on you."
He held a knife in his right hand and tied the girl's hands and feet with nylonza, then tied her to the tree, which violated her for nearly an hour. After he let the girl go, the girl cried out and ran to school.
The man arrived at the workplace around 9:30 a.m. before he could not reply to several messages and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were stained with dirt, grass and leaves bark, he claimed to have been in a road anger accident, soared with another driver, drove the car into the bushes, and turned from the pavement.
The man's trial-trial hearing will continue on Tuesday.
California police have not been charged with shooting blacks
On Thursday, federal authorities refused to file civil rights lawsuits against the Sacramento police who shot an unarmed black man, sparking a number of protests and pushing for changes in state laws that limit the use of lethal force by law enforcement agencies.
The U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI said a federal review of the 2018 killing of Stephen Clark, 22, showed that there was "sufficient evidence" to prosecute two police officers, Terence Melkadante and Jared Rovinette, who would return to their positions for duty.
In March, the California Attorney General's Office refused to prosecute two California police officers after completing a nearly one-year case investigation. Attorney General Harvey Bessela pointed out that evidence suggests that the two police officers had reason to believe their lives were threatened as the man was approaching them and believed to have held firearms in his hands.
On Thursday, the Sacramento Police also issued a statement saying that their internal investigation did not reveal any violation of police regulations or training requirements.
"Despite the fact that this accident or the process leading to this unforeseen incident did not reveal a violation of police regulations, we remain determined to implement new strategies to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring," said Daniel Harn, director of Sacramento Police.
Clark's brother Stefan Clark posted a news release on Facebook Thursday, saying he was meeting with federal and local authorities at the time. "These people (in terms of accountability) are completely out of office," he wrote.
Authorities said the police were convinced that Clark had a pistol in his hands when he was close to the police, after fleeing the police's stalking and running toward his grandmother's backyard. The night before they heard reports of someone shattering car glass and slippery windows from an older neighbor's home, the police officers chased Clara.
When Clark was close to two policemen, the police fired seven shots at him.
Federal investigators examined relevant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, live video and recordings, police records, police reports and autopsy reports, to determine whether the police intentionally used force beyond objective and reasonable limits.
Legislators added an amendment to the oldest law in the U.S. that regulates the use of lethal force by police last month, which will become the strictest standard for using force in the United States after all officers are trained.
California's old standard makes it very difficult to prosecute gunmen, and even more difficult to try to criminalize them. This is based on the principle of "reasonable fear" that they can use lethal force when prosecutors or reviewers believe police have reason to worry about their own safety.
The new law, which came into force on January 1, requires police to use lethal force only in "necessary moments" of responding to a deadly threat to the police or surroundings.
Pope Francis warns tech executives to use artificial intelligence for public benefit
Pope Francis warned tech executives, diplomats and financiers on Friday that creating artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development competition increases the risk of social inequalities unless this work has an ethical assessment of public interest.
Francis spoke at a Vatican meeting with government envoys, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethicists. A handful of scholars and Catholic bishops attended the Congress on Public Interest in the Digital Age.
The Vatican hopes to have a place in the artificial intelligence prospects and dangerous debates, this three-day meeting is the latest proof of that idea.
The debates included technological advances in the war, a growing reliance on machines for future jobs, case studies of the Holocaust in Christchurch, New Zealand, and decisions made by social media companies after the mass shooting video spread.
In this speech, Francis praised the potential of technological progress and pointed out that machines in the early industrial revolution kept workers away from danger and avoided monotonous labor. But Francis also warned that increasing dependence on robots for profit could deprive people of their dignity.
"If technological progress is the cause of increasing inequalities, technology cannot be called real progress." If so-called technological progress becomes an enemy of public interest, then society as a whole will unfortunately degenerate into a barbaric era dominated by the strongest laws.
Organizers of the conference said they would like to take advantage of the participants' expertise and find appropriate advisors for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
The House of Representatives held a vote on Friday to stop U.S. President Donald Trump from issuing the "State of Emergency Statement," which Trump wants to use to fund his proposed border wall.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution that ended Trump's action with 236 votes to 174, and sent it to the president.[11] Republicans and an independent party expressed support for the resolution.
Trump may veto the resolution, which will be his sixth time blocking congressional legislation as president.
Neither House of Congress seems to have reached a two-thirds majority vote required to overturn the veto order.
Trump declared a state of emergency in February due to his failure to get the money he wanted to build the southern border wall from the Mexican government and Congress. The Trump administration plans to divert $3.6 billion from military construction funds for border projects.
Democrats accused Trump not only of bypassing Congress's "wallet rights," but also of using key defense funds to create unnecessary obstacles. A handful of Republicans in the House and Senate have also expressed concern that Trump's statement would lead to future "overriding powers."
Some Senate Republicans coming to the election next year are under tremendous political pressure on a state of emergency vote.
Google launches its 21th anniversary graffiti: A story you don't know
Today, Google celebrates its birthday with graffiti. The graffiti is a 1990s-style computer photo featuring the Google search page and date stamping on September 27, 1998, surrounded by colorful paper chips of Google's color. A smaller graffiti will be displayed on the search results page, whose logo is designed as a digitally shaped candle. This search giant was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, California when they were students at Stanford University.
If you think the company's founding date is the company's birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, however, the company never celebrated its own birthday on this day, at least not in the form of graffiti. Until 2005, Google used graffiti to celebrate its birthday on September 7 and later changed to September 27.
Initially, the search engine was called "network reptiles" and later changed its name to "Google".
"We named our system Google because it's a common spelling by Google (or 10,100), which fits in with our goal of building large-scale search engines," said Sergey Brin and Laurens (Larry) Page in a paper published in 1998 on the launch of prototypes for 'large search engines'.
The company was founded thanks to the investment of $100,000 by Andy Betorsheim, co-founder of Solar Computer Systems; in June 1999, the company raised $25 million from Red Sequoia Capital and Keppeng Huaying. Google moved to Mountain View office that year, which is still there. In 2001, the company's technology was patented.
Starting from a web search engine, Google is an affiliate company that operates in more than 100 languages worldwide and responds to trillions of searches every year.
"Today, Google has more than 60,000 employees in 50 different countries - from oil pipes, Android to treasures and of course Google searches - developing hundreds of products for billions of people around the world. Although we abandoned Lego servers, the company added only a few dogs, our passion for creating technology for everyone has been with us - from hostels to garages until today."
Trump denies Iran's claim that oil prices fell after the U.S. proposed lifting of sanctions
On January 10, 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani delivered a speech at a ceremony in Tehran, Iran.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani claimed Friday that the US proposal to lift all sanctions against Iran in exchange for negotiations led to a fall in oil prices. President Donald Trump and the U.S. State Department later denied these claims, leading to a rebound in oil prices from a low point.
The latest price of Western Texas crude oil futures fell to $55.91, a 0.9 percent drop before it was down to $54.79. Brent crude futures dropped to $61.89, a 1.4 percent drop.
"What sanctions will be lifted in the future remains to be discussed, but they (the United States) have made clear that all sanctions will be lifted."
Trump later responded to Iran, "Of course not!" he said that Iran wanted him to lift sanctions in order to hold a meeting.
According to Bloomberg News Agency, the U.S. State Department described the report as "unfounded" and added that the United States was determined to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero.
The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, blamed Iran for the attack. Tehran denies that it has played any role in the incident.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the US consumer news and commercial channels.
John Kildaf, the revitalizing capital, said: "For a long time people may not be optimistic about the deceleration of tensions in the United States and Iraq, which will allow large quantities of oil to immediately return to market."
"It's not just about Iran's production and exports, but also millions of barrels of oil in floating storage facilities as well as millions of barrels of oil staying at Chinese ports waiting for customs handling," Kildaf said.
Trump last year ousted the U.S. from a nuclear deal signed by Iran, the United States and five other countries under which they lifted sanctions against Iran in return for their commitment to halting its nuclear projects.
Iran has been the target of U.S. sanctions for decades, with Washington accusing it of recently attacking tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, which Tehran denied. Iran also shot down a U.S. military drone and announced plans to execute 17 suspected U.S. spies.
Afghanistan to strengthen security response to presidential elections
Afghanistan has carried out large-scale security operations across the country to prepare for Saturday's national presidential election.
The government will arrange for some 100,000 security personnel to guard polling stations in response to the threat of Taliban forces.
Many voters (especially those in rural areas) will remain at home due to fear of reprisals, while others say the voting system is prepared for powerful people and not suitable for the poor.
Royal News: How Princess Beatrice "graciously copes with hostile family members"
The Duke and Duchess of York announced Thursday that their eldest daughter, Princess Beitrice, was engaged to her boyfriend, 34-year-old real estate tycoon Eduardo Mapeli Moz. As the ninth successor to the British throne, the princess will marry Mapeli Moz next year.
"We have a lot of similar interests and values, and we know that this will greatly benefit us in the years to come full of love and happiness."
Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the parents of Princess Betrays, also expressed their excitement.
The Duchess of York wrote on Twitter: "I know how my mother feels, so I shed tears of joy.
Andrew and I are both the luckiest people because we have two great son-in-laws."
This royal wedding will be an opportunity for the whole Royal family to reunite, hoping that it will completely repair the relationship between Fij and Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sarah has been involved in one of the biggest scandals ever made by the royal family, her relationship with other members has become unusually difficult to deal with.
In 1992, five months after the announcement of a break with Prince Andrew, she and her "financial advisor" were photographed in a holiday home in St Tropez.
In these photos, there are pictures of a millionaire from Texas John Bryan kissing, sucking the toes and bows of the Duchess, said Prince Philip reacted most strongly to the scandalous behavior of the Duchess' daughter-in-law.
However, his actions against the Duke of York were reported to be "stunned" and Princess Beatrice claimed that her mother was a victim of "a despicable act that made her feel unwelcome."
Kate and William, who closed the door: The shocking habits of the couple were exposed
The Duchess' spokesman was unable to comment on the matter, but a friend of Ficci said: "Sala's daughters are very bored with how royalty treats their mothers and it is no secret.
"Some of the bills she has received are quite negligent.
"They have been blaming their fathers for allowing this to happen, especially Beatrice who has been begging Prince Andrew not to treat their mother as a deportee."
Last October, at the wedding of Princess Eugene and Jack Brooksbank, Philip and Sarah were photographed together for the first time in 26 years.
A second-wave strike in Oregon
About half of these employees earn less than $40,000 per year (hundreds of people earn less than $25,000 per year). At the same time, the average annual salary of the university principal is $500,000 and the annual salary of four college sports coaches is slightly lower at a total of $1 million.
As Alejandro Segurah, another information technology worker at Portland State University, said: "I am willing to take a strike because I think it is unfair that the wages paid to people do not guarantee their lives in the cities they serve."
The contract negotiations that began in February broke out in mid-August when the bosses made some particularly excessive suggestions - a slight increase in the cost of living, denial of qualification requirements for long-term university staff, and an increase in employee meals - which employees considered to be disrespectful or even cruel treatment. Fulmer said: "There is an unwritten class system in college."
"For decades, educators have been attacked. We've finally stood up and fought back. Corporate executives see their relatively hateful pay rising at a faster rate than inflation that class discrimination and the squeeze of the middle class can be reconciled."
The staff of Oregon State University is not the only group to act. Oregon is now a battle-pack filled with gunpowder, and the fuse has been burned warmly and brightly. Frey Maier's grocery stores are ramping up campaigns against employers, despite no formal strike plans; their trade unions - local 555th Confederation of Food and Business Workers - have called for joint boycotts and presented unfair labor practices on the chain.
In the healthcare industry, a strike (98 per cent) would be approved if 4,500 local 49-member members of the International Federation of Service Workers in Kessa Medical Establishments had not reached an agreement before the expiry of their existing contracts in October (only temporarily avoiding them through new interim agreements). In other areas of the industry, the Oregon Nursing Association representing more than 120 nurses at Astoria Hospital was stuck in contract negotiations with the hospital administration, whose final contract expired in May.
"The labor movement in Oregon is very strong, and it's really thorough. This is part of the national wave of labour growth.
We can only hope that the spirit of such collective action will further spread to Midwest agriculture, Southern manufacturing, Texas oil fields, Appalachian coal mines, Northeast Construction, Silicon Valley tech giants and any other area or industry in the middle. God knows that everything is worth paying for.
Political Civilization: The new award program was set up to bridge Westminster divides and honor those polite politicians
The new award program was set up to honor polite politicians.
After the reconvening of Parliament, Westminster ushered in an undisputed week.
In this debated week, parliamentarians face threats and remarks from Prime Minister Boris Johnson have sparked outrage.
In response to the differences, the "Political Civilization" award was unveiled last Friday, and politicians of the year were awarded a prize of PS3,000 for philanthropy.
Boris Johnson has been criticised for his tone used in the House of Commons
Lord Stewart, in announcing the award, said: "Everyone agrees that British politics is facing a crisis of trust and civilisation.
"Brexit disputes are intensifying and differences and sufferings are growing, and we firmly believe that politics must respond not to these trends but to resist them."
These awards are a small attempt by a group of people to bring the public's attention - dissimilar or non-political - to those who defend their justification in an elegant and polite manner, as well as those who can reach out and cooperate with people across differences affecting all of us."
The nominations will be announced in the sixth cycle, and the awarding ceremony will take place next March.
In an exclusive interview with the British Standard Latex today, former cabinet minister Anbul Rad accused Johnson of using provocative words that "does incite violence."
Johnson said he "deplored" the threat to lawmakers.
Jesse Phillips "frightened" after receiving the death threat of 'fearing'
On Thursday, Labour MP Jesse Phillips - another critic of Johnson - said a man was arrested after trying to "skip" the door of her constituency office, allegedly when the man shouted he was a "fascist."
Meanwhile, Liberal Democratic leader Joe Swift made a speech to the police after her young child was threatened.
Ellie Cooper, the daughter of Labour's senior lawmaker Ivite Cooper, posted a fast-track post on Twitter describing her concerns about her mother after Cox was murdered.
U.S. income disparities are the highest in history
Last year, the U.S. rich and poor income disparity reached its highest level since the 1967 Census Bureau began to produce statistics. Both Washington and New York were among the largest income disparities.
The U.S. may be the wealthiest country in the world, but its status quo is similar: super-rich can continue to grow at all costs, and poor families often rely on "to fund me" (a crowdfunding site) to pay medical bills.
One way to measure income disparities is the Kini coefficient. The Kini coefficient is at least 0, representing an absolute average of 1, and represents a presumption that a family has all its income throughout the country. Over the past 50 years, the Census Bureau has been tracking this indicator. In 1967, the United States' Kini coefficient was 0.397, but in 2018 it has climbed to the highest level of 0.485.
For example, the World Bank estimated South Africa's 0.63 Kini coefficient in 2014 and Brazil's 0.53 Kini coefficient in 2017 compared to below 0.4 for all EU countries.
New data shows that the areas where income disparities are most severe are often wealth-gathering, including Washington, D.C., New York and Connecticut, and of course some poorer ones, such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana. In Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota, these five states have the highest level of economic equality.
The Census Bureau's data also shows that median household income growth has stagnated, rising to more than $62,000. This is the highest level measured by U.S. community surveys, but it was only 0.8% in 2017 and 2018, a significant decline from the previous three years, which would have been virtually ungrowth if inflation were taken into account.
The new statistics are likely to bring the direction of campaigning for Democratic candidates nominated in next year's presidential election, which usually supports more taxes on super-rich and big companies.
In fact, these policies seem to only bring extra revenue to executives, while most other Americans miss the benefits of economic growth and record low unemployment.
A North Carolina man took five shots at the same lottery draw
A North Carolina man drew five times from the same lottery draw, including a $163,634 jackpot.
Garland Lancaster of Pickville told North Carolina Education Lottery Officers that when he stayed at the Westsam Brothers Company in Pickville, he bought five cash lottery tickets with his own five-set numbers and could make five draws on Monday night.
"When the draw, my wife helped me to write a number," said Lancaster, "when my wife handed me the paper and I checked out the lottery, I couldn't believe it. One line matched five digits while the rest matched four numbers.
One line of 5 numbers for Lancaster matched the winning number, earning him $163,634, while the remaining four figures matched their respective winners' numbers to earn him $250.
The winner said he intends to use the money to pay his bills and carry out some home repairs.
Tristan Thompson, Cole Cardesan's former cheating boyfriend, left another very provocative comment on her photo wall before rumors that he wanted to combine with Cardesan.
Tristan Thompson, Cole Cardesan's former cheating boyfriend, left another very provocative comment on her photo wall photos before rumors that he wanted to combine with Cardesan.
Earlier this year, the 35-year-old star completely abandoned the National Basketball Association player because Thompson was accused of stealing ties with family friend Jordan Woods - before Collier had cheated on their daughter, True, when she was nine months pregnant.
It was found that Tristan left another warm word of praise on the photo wall homepage of Coler.
However, 28-year-old Tristan refused to give up easily - leaving an embarrassing overtone on his ex-girlfriend's latest selfies.
In this blurred picture, Kohler stood before the rising sun and wrote in his mother's image: "May you have the courage to explore every dream of your dreams."
In a public comment, Tristan wrote: "The sun shines brightly on the beautiful you [the diamond emoji].
Fans were irritated by this comment, and someone responded: "Yes, the diamond you dropped."
Tristan betrayed her when she was nine months pregnant
Another fan warned: "Get out of the photo wall."
The third person wrote: "Colle, don't worry."
Just a few days ago, Tristan wrote: "Perfect", next to the heart-shaped eye expression, below one of Cole's other real-life photos, is a picture she modeled for Gales jeans.
The Sun reported that earlier this month, Tristan spent PS400,000 on Drake's proposal to buy a Porsche for Cole and want to combine it with Cole.
Earlier this year, he was accused of stealing from a friend of the Cadesan family, Jonathan Woods.
After his rap partner urged another "big move", Tristan decided to choose the pleasing gift, which is said to be Porsche 911.
Eventually, his friends said Tristan had won Colle's invitation to attend the "Taco" dinner at her residence on Tuesday - a step closer to reuniting with Cadesanne and their 17-month-old daughter, Tru.
One source said: "Tristan and Drake are good friends, and he has been inquired about Drake's advice when he plans to retaliate with Kardashian.
Tristan's infidelity made Cole heartbroken.
Drake told him that if he wanted to retaliate with Colle, he had to do his best.
"Despite the use of a stylish supercar to exchange a casual dinner may sound unreasonable.
"But after Tristan did these things, Kohler didn't immediately lay a red carpet for him."
The couple are TRU's 17-month-old parents.
In the new season's real-life show "Meaning with Cardassin" series of 16 trailers, Cole Cardassin tears lamented due to his boyfriend Tristan Thompson's betrayal.
The Sun reported last month that Tristan, after vowing to invite Kohler to a romantic Greek trip: "I'll get my family back."
While Cole was heartbroken by Tristan's constant misrepresentation during their love affair, he invited Tristan to attend their daughter True's first birthday party earlier this year.
However, the star's family reality show "Meeting with Cardesan" later showed that the incident ended with Koller's tears of hardening acceptance of Tristan's infidelity.
Failure of the baby hospital's freezing machine, damage to stem cells in 56 children with cancer
The failure of the Los Angeles Children's Hospital refrigerated machine caused damage to blood stem cells from 56 children, which were collected and stored as each patient began oncological treatment for future use.
"We apologize for the pain or confusion caused by patients and their families. If you do not receive a letter or call from our team, it means that your child will not be affected."
All patients have received basic treatment, with the exception of one patient. Chief Medical Officer James Stan says the patient does need to reassemble stem cells.
Letters sent to the patient's family in early September that informed stem cell loss messages were accidentally sent to children rather than parents. The court also apologized to their parents, saying they would monitor the message.
The hospital said that long-term storage of stem cell damage did not harm the health of any child.
One of the patients described it as "unbearable." 13-year-old Sean Anderson Coroner was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma (a cancer that is often found in the adrenal gland) and treated stem cells. The boy didn't get off his body all day, collecting stem cells from his blood.
"I'll try to fall asleep, but my body begins to trembled and then I begin to get crazy and start to cry," Corona told the ABC-7.
In November, Corona will have no cancer recurrence for three years. But his mother Elizabeth Anderson said she was worried that he might not be able to collect more stem cells from his blood if his cancer recurs.
Stan says patients are recommended to reassess stem cells only when a patient's condition relapse requires stem cells.
"We think this is almost unlikely, so we won't ask anyone to do it in advance."
The hospital has replaced the refrigeration machine, and sensor monitoring and alarm systems have also been upgraded.
"Obviously, this is a huge expense for us," Stan said. "We will contact each family directly in person to ensure that all their questions are answered."
Prince Harry takes his mother-in-law's footsteps across the Angolan minefield.
It was the sixth day that the Duke of Sussex visited Africa with his wife, Meghan and Archie. But on Friday morning, Prince Harry returned to Angola alone intending to inherit the remains of her mother, Princess Diana.
Harry, wearing a bright blue protective vest provided by the Halo Trust, successfully inherited his mother's legacy. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana left her footprint on a similar road through an area of deadly mines in Angola that was left behind during the civil war. This became one of the most iconic pictures of her short life.
On 15 January 1997, Princess Diana of Wales dressed in protective vests and masks visited a mined area cleared by the Aleutian Trust charity in Angola's Wanbo province.
Diana has been working to eliminate such weapons of war, but during her lifetime she failed to do so and died just a few months before the International Convention on the Prohibition of Mines was promulgated in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world was still unable to get rid of the threat of landmines. Prince Harry detonated a newly discovered mine that responded loudly and clearly to his mother's remains.
Prince Harry said that "mines are no healed wounds of war. By demining, we can help local communities achieve peace which brings opportunities."
Prince Harry detonated the most recent mine detection in Angola.
Thomas Cook's Pension Trustees Plan Spending Salvation Agreement
Thomas Cook's pension fund has begun negotiations with professional insurers on an agreement to save the bankrupt tourism group's retirement plan benefits.
Sky News was informed that Stevie Soo St, chairman of the trusteeship agency, is negotiating a buy-in agreement with several companies that would exempt most of Thomas Cook's 14,000 members from a significant reduction in pension payments.
Any deal with insurance companies may involve spending cuts, which are much smaller than the 10% cut that was triggered by shifting pension plans to a lifeboat on an old-age protection fund.
The discussion is still at a very preliminary stage - even if successful - the agreement will have to wait until the Pension Fund assesses the Thomas Cook program.
Thomas Cook's bosses are facing a probe into the cause of the group's collapse
The investigation could last for two years and if the Thomas Cook program did introduce a pension protection fund, spending on some 10,000 pensioners in the future would be reduced by 10 percent.
According to the news, several pension risk transfer experts and at least a new "superfund" integration company are negotiating an agreement with Thomas Cook's trustees.
Four days after the stalemate in Britain's oldest travel company, a message of trustees' efforts to ensure the welfare of their members sparked an international repatriation plan and left thousands unemployed.
Thomas Cook's deep bankruptcy sparked a fiercely blaming game, with board members, government ministers and auditors having to explain their respective actions in the months prior to the group's bankruptcy.
According to the latest data, Thomas Cook's four pension plans are well funded and have a PS100m surplus on the basis of an old-age protection fund.
In total, they hold assets worth about 1.5 billion pounds
However, Sky News revealed last month that the trustee asked Thomas Cook's proposed salvage agreement to add more concessional terms, which brought complexity to the conclusion of the deal.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy ended its 178-year solvency deal, prompting government insolvency services, accounting regulators and an influential parliamentary committee to initiate an investigation into Thomas Cook.
The Ministers have established a task force to deal with the crisis, which has made creditors slim in profits after the group's bankruptcy.
To date, only less than half of the overseas UK clients of Thomas Cook have returned home.
Just hours before its bankruptcy, Thomas Cook sent a final pleading to his lenders for a PS200m reduction in financing demand.
What's wrong with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended on Sunday night, but no agreement was reached and Thomas Cook was forced to seek new financing for more than PS100m, which was its last insanity. The company had lost PS1.5bn in half a year and the trading conditions were deteriorating.
Thomas Cook was created in 1841 by a 32-year-old furniture carpenter, a former Baptist missionary who began his day's train journey from Leicester to Raffleberg, where each person had only one shilling.
From then on, Thomas Cook became one of the world's largest resort companies and ushered in its 175th anniversary three years ago.
A spokesman for the pension fund said: "Some bankruptcy events, such as Thomas Cook's failure, are exactly why the pension fund was founded.
"We provide financial guarantees for the future of pensioners' fixed-income planners, and planners should rest assured that we will protect them."
Thomas Cook's pension trustee spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday.
The picture is that the newly born rhinos are rubbing their mother's nose and exploring new homes.
The baby named Strata was born in the Kotswald Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire earlier this month, and it is the first female baby born to Monty and Ruby.
This cub is healthy and well cared for, as can be seen from the photo, it's curious about the environment around him and sleeping with his mother in a straw bed.
In 2009, mother Ruby and another female named Nancy joined the Wildlife Park in hopes of birthing the first small rhinoceros in the park with Monty.
In 2013, Nancy gave birth to a female puppy named Astreed, the third female puppy born in the park for 49 years.
Jamie Craig, director of the Kotswald Wildlife Park, said: "We have made tremendous success in cultivating existing rhino populations.
"Stra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby's family, and our bull Monty has proven to be a great father."
"He is the perfect combination of a dominant bull and prudent parents.
"It's particularly satisfying that Ruby gave birth to a cow calf - which is crucial for the development of breeding programs, and Stella will eventually be transferred to another group hoping she can also become a successful mother."
Ruby had previously given birth to two male cubs, Ian in 2015 and Alan in 2017. Allen remained in the park while Ian was at the Turin Zoo in Italy.
When Allen was only a week old, he weighed about 11 inches.
Incarceration births are considered extremely rare.Females reproduce only once every two and a half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, female rhinos usually go through 16 to 18 months of pregnancy in order to produce a small rhino.
It is considered one of the longest gestational animals in land mammals, after only 22 months for elephants.
The newly born rhinoceros can stand up within an hour after birth. After birth, the rhinoceros will immediately try to suck, although in the first few days its feet may be somewhat unstable.
It will suck about a year of milk under the watch of her mother.
Their relationship is very intimate, with small rhinos staying with the mother for at least two years. The females will be very active in protecting their offspring and they will intimidate opponents if challenged.
Involuntary solo man Alex Minasian told Toronto police he was a member of the 4chan website organization
The man in the picture allegedly killed 10 passers-by in Toronto, who told police he was a member of an online sex disordered men's organization.
Alex Minasian, 26, said he was a member of the 4chan website's involuntary soloists forum.
After the attack on April 23, 2018, he now faces 10 murder charges and 16 attempted murder charges in Canada.
When asked about the dead, he told police: "I feel like I have completed my mission."
After the incident, attention was drawn to the world of online loneliness, anger and boredom.
Minasian said he had contacted a killer in California who was furious about the woman who rejected him.
He was accused of driving a rented van in a busy community in northern Toronto, crashing into the crowd. Eight women and two men were stabbed to death, aged between 22 and 94.
His trial began in February, but his ban on publication of police interrogations has been lifted today. Police interviewed a few hours after the attack.
Minasian said he had never made a girlfriend and was a virgin, admitting that he used the van as a weapon and saying he wanted to launch more attacks.
"Several other people I've met online have the same feeling," he said, adding that they were "too timid to take action to excite outrage."
The involuntary solo movement is an online subculture group linked to the deadly attacks of Toronto and California and Florida. This group advocates a feminized notion that men have the right to have sex with women.
Sociologists and other scholars studying this group believe that "involuntary soloists" have gradually become a popular anger against certain men who are angry at the rejection of women and tend to generate ideas of violent retaliation.
At online forums, hobbyists sometimes use "Chard" and "Stacey" as contemptuous slangs, referring respectively to men and women who are more active in sex life.
Minasian said he had discussed his sexual disillusionment on the 4chan website, a site where extremists have published opinions that are notoriously infamous.
U.S. court lines worry about the resurgence of gunshots, banning "clown" audience jogging to see
The largest independent stadium in the U.S. bans jogging audiences from viewing highly praised Clowns - a story about Batman's super reincarnation. While theaters have banned viewers from wearing masks or drawing faces, security concerns remain.
Most U.S. stadiums have banned viewers from wearing masks, drawing faces or carrying toy weapons because another Batman movie "The Dark Knight Rise" was released in 2012 when a major shooting took place in Colorado Orola City. At that time, the gunmen wore clown dresses, shot and threw tear gas at the audience, resulting in 12 deaths and 70 injuries.
However, the landmark cinema has announced that it is not allowed to see a restricted-grade movie called Clown.
"I want the audience to be more relaxed when watching movies," said Top Pictures Chairman and CEO Ted Mondoff, a Hollywood reporter.
Headquartered in Los Angeles, the company has 52 cinemas in 27 regions of the country and is the largest professional cinema line in the United States.
At the same time, Kansas-based U.S. multi-room theaters, the largest film chain in the United States, reaffirmed that cinemas prohibited "masks, painted faces or any objects that obscured their faces," but welcomed audiences wearing costumes.
The ban on masks and counterfeit guns is largely based on practical security considerations, but as the clown comes closer, there are fears that it will trigger a simulated shooting. The Los Angeles Police Department said police would "wait" around the theater on the day of the premiere, while the second-largest chain in the United States, King's Theatre, said they were implementing security measures developed "in cooperation with NATO".
The U.S. Army even warned soldiers to pay attention to "involuntary soloists," usually men dissatisfied with their lack of dating opportunities, who worship clowns and may imitate his cruelty.
The clown, directed by Todd Phillips, led by Jacqueon Phoenix and scheduled to land on the United States House line on October 4, is expected to record again. The film's protagonist was a descendant of an isolated, mentally unstable man who became a murderous madman, green hair, black face, and Batman's enemy.
Some commentators worry that the film may have a negative impact because it sympathizes with the antagonist and is too violent.
Midway broadcaster announced today that Ms. Melody Spence Cooper, chairman of the company, will publish a much-anticipated new book to help women entrepreneurs and executives develop their careers. The Success Trading Guide for Women's Friends shared many of her insights and perspectives, including how women speak at the negotiating table in order to get equal status, and how to use the female version of "Alumni Relations Network" to promote business development.
In his book, Spencer Cooper constantly cites anecdotes to interpret controversial topics, including the "#I am also" movement and Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign and its impact on the rise of U.S. women's empowerment.
In 2017, Spencer Cooper gave a groundbreaking speech at the Chicago National Association of Women Business Owners to promote self-priority. The author's own book was coinciding with it. The language style of the Guide for Successful Trade in Women's Friends is very sublime and every female friend can find contact with herself in the book.
Merloty combines personal anecdotes, success stories, setbacks and practical experiences with businesswoman Christie Hefner, the daughter of Hugh Hefner, founder of The Playboy, said: "The Guide to Successful Dealing with Women's Friends is very interesting and helpful. Melody brings together individual anecdotes, success stories, frustration lessons and real experience. From how to express her thoughts at a conference to when it's right for friends, everyone can benefit from Melody's story."
As chairman of Midway Broadcasting Corporation, she took control of the company in 1999 and successfully became one of the elite female broadcasters in the United States. Midway Broadcasting Corporation is a top-ranking women's family media company with multiple radio and interactive platforms.
T. Sean Taylor, co-author of the book, is a journalist, writer and founder of Tree Top's full-service media consulting firm.
Romania's military base in the Black Sea is worth billions
According to The Times, Romania will spend 2.5 billion euros on modernizing the Black Sea military base in order to counter Russia's growing power in the region. Documents released by local news sites prove that Mikhail Kogrignihanno Air Force Base, located about 200 kilometers east of Bucharest, will be consistent with NATO standards.
After Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began using its deep-sea base in Sebastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria to increase naval power in the Black Sea. Russia also hindered transport in the region, capturing three Ukrainian vessels last year in the Kerch Strait.
In February, 500 U.S. troops arrived at the Romanian air base. The British Air Force's European Typhoon Fighter Squadron has been stationed and completed its deployment.
Ukraine's "New Berlin Wall" Scandal Encircled Again
Poroshenko's eagerness to win the support of President Trump, who is increasingly concerned that political opponents will obstruct his re-election, cleared Julianne's path by pressuring Ukraine's attorney general Yuri Lutsenko (later dismissed) to investigate Joe Biden and his son in an effort to help him re-elect.
But it's unclear how the Trump administration would help him reverse the decadence ahead of the two rounds of Ukrainian presidential elections in March and April this year. In any case, he was hit hard by defeating Zelensky, whose officials soon became a new target for the Trump team to crack down on Biden.
While Democrats want President Trump to be impeached for his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have fought back in a self-made Ukrainian scandal. They recite an undisclosed claim that Ukraine had colluded with the Clinton campaign to reduce Trump's election chances in 2016, and claim that Biden used his vice president's position to stop Ukraine from investigating his son without much evidence.
For years, the Ukrainian people have been tired of watching their leaders continue to use power and privileges in exchange for personal economic or political interests; today most Ukrainians are ignoring perhaps the worst scandal that has hit the Trump administration in the White House since the Watergate incident overthrew President Richard Nixon in 1974.
Ukraine, which in the past had little American attention, has now become Washington's central stage, causing great confusion in Ukraine. This feeling is fraught with pride, and hundreds of years later under the shadow of a powerful Russian neighbor on the north, Ukraine is no longer seen as a dead water basin but an incredible turning point for the fate of the world's most powerful nation.
This week, Pavlo Klimkin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine under the auspices of Poroshenko, tweeted a thin message saying that "as a country leading to impeachment of the President of the United States" in the chronicle was "not an excellent prospect."
Pakistani netizen brother Kandel Baloch sentenced to life in prison for honour killing
Kaendel Baloch, famous for his social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
Pakistan's social media star Karendale Baloch's brother was convicted of murder on Friday and sentenced to life in prison, the country's highest-profile "honour killing."
Baloch is famous for his funny selfies and does not count anything by Western standards, but in Pakistan, which strongly dislikes feminism, she was strangled in July 2016.
Her brother, Mohammed Wassim, was arrested and a few days later he said at a press conference that he had no regrets for what he had done to himself, admitting that "of course" it was his murder of his sister, whose actions were "unbearable."
His lawyer Sadar Mehmud told the AFP that the court in the eastern city of Multan had found his client guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment, a high-profile sentence.
He said: "If circumstances permit, he will be acquitted by the High Court."
Earlier, Baroch's mother, Anwar May, told the AFP that she had hoped her son would be acquitted.
"He's innocent. Killed was my daughter, and killed was my son," she said.
Balloch's murder has become an international headline and calls for action to combat the so-called "honour killing" that a victim - usually a woman - is murdered for contempt of patriarchal social norms.
Women were burned, shot, stabbed and strangled for their freedom to choose their husband or - in the case of Baloch - for crimes such as "stigmatizing" their families by glorifying their gender.
Such murders are usually committed by close relatives, who can seek forgiveness from their relatives under Pakistan's blood debt and retaliation laws.
After three months of Baloch's death, the parliament passed new legislation that stipulates that those who kill for honour will be sentenced to life imprisonment.
However, whether or not murder is defined as an honourable crime is decided by the judge at his discretion, which means that in theory assassins can claim different motives but still be pardoned.
In the Balloch case, her parents initially insisted that they would not forgive their son.
But it was also saddened to think of losing his son, and they changed their mind saying they wanted him to be forgiven.
The international community &apos; s resentment of the murder has forced the Government of Pakistan to take unprecedented steps by declaring it as a successor to the victim together with its parents, however, which forces the case to continue.
Some of Baroch's well-known actions include performing strip dance for the Pakistani cricket team and wearing a falling scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
Her behavior has evoked some criticism and threats, but many people including young people believe that the Kim Kardashian figure can be seen as a bold, empowering political act that opens new ground for the country.
The "honour" killings are rooted in tribal social norms, which continue to prevail throughout South Asia and specifically regulate the behaviour of women, although men may also be victims.
Three Scottish students are ranked as the best in Europe
Three students at Dundee University in England were rated as the best graduates in Europe.
In the 2019 Global Undergraduate Awards, three students at Dundee University were ranked as Europe's best graduates in their respective fields, while five other students at the University were also recognized by the jury.
Scott Sherdrick graduated from molecular genetics and won the European Best Graduate Award in Life Sciences; Chester Conford applied to Master of Mental Health Care Science, winning the awards for nursing, midwifery and full-time health care; and Lora Nebbs won the award for Visual Arts.
Despite the fact that all three students were in the final round of a global general election, they slammed into their final fierce race with 3,500 students from around the world.
Professor Blair Grab, vice president of education at Dundee University, said: "To reach this stage, our students and graduates face a rivalry with the world's top university students.
"Thousands of students from all over the world are incentivizing competition for undergraduate awards, and Dundee University's students are representative of these winners, which also well reflects the quality of our students and the level of education they have received here.
"Welcome warmly to Scott, Chester and Lora for their extraordinary achievements as well as to other Dundee student representatives who have been highly acclaimed."
The other five Dundee students are also recognized in the world's top undergraduate award, which recognizes their top academic performance and shares them with global audiences.
The five recognized students were: Nicholas Gallagher and James Osborne (both life sciences students), Ferentz Xiaomishikawa Specific (medical), Kathleen Scott (anatomical science) and Wako Yoyama (Philosophy).
The selection further praises the best undergraduate academic performance in the school and helps students and succeeding graduates from all over the world build a bridge of collaboration.
The oldest archaic cluster "The Queen's Court"
An international team of astronomers, using the Spartan, Keck and Gemini telescopes, discovered about 12 galaxies that existed around 13 billion years ago. This is the oldest original cluster to date. The largest of these was the blemish found by the Spartan telescope ten years ago, named after a queen in ancient Japanese mythology.
In the present universe, clusters can contain hundreds of galaxies, but how these clusters are formed in astronomy remains a big question. To understand the formation of clusters, astronomers look for possible origins in the ancient universe.
The team of astronomers was led by Yu Yi, a researcher at the Japanese National Astronomical Observatory. He explained: "The original cluster is a rare and exceptionally dense galaxy system that is very difficult to detect. To solve this problem, we used the wide-view field of the Spartan telescope to map the vast range of the sky and look for the original cluster."
On a map of the universe drawn by the Spartan telescope, the team discovered a suspected protocluster galaxy Z66OD, which was 15 times denser than normal galaxies at that time. Subsequently, the team carried out subsequent spectral observations using the Keck Observatory and the North Gemini Telescope to confirm that the 12 galaxies were stored 13 billion years ago and are the oldest known protocluster so far.
Interestingly, one of the 12 galaxies in Z66OD is a large galaxy that was discovered through the Sbarru telescope in 2009 with massive amounts of gas. Zhang Ze Zhongmei, a team member at the National Observatory of Japan and University of Tokyo, said: "It is possible to find protostar clusters near such mass objects as Bhimihu. However, we are surprised that Bhimihu is not located in the center of the original cluster, but on the edge of its 500 million light-years away." Ironically, the mythical Queen Bhimihu is also believed to have lived an isolated life.
Nancy Pelosi as daughter of Christine Pelosi
A new book about Nancy Pelosi, the president of the U.S. House of Representatives, is about to be published, and the author is familiar with her daughter Cristine Pelosi.
The Nancy Pelosi Road will be released on November 26. Christine Pelosi's work describes how a five-year-old mother became the first female president of the House of Representatives, and her current leadership to the House Democrats under the Trump administration. According to him, Kristen Pelosi's new book would intertwin her mother's "professional and personal experiences."
Cristine Pelosi currently serves as a Democratic strategic analyst with The Campaign Camps and Game Camps 2.0. Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has filmed many documentary films about contemporary politics.
Warren's money to buy lemonade donated to an anti-abortion charity
When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Democrat of Massachusetts) bought a drink from two girls running lemon sodas in August, she might not have realized that the $10 she had purchased would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
"Our daughters think that [Warren] is friendly," said Dan Michel, a Trump proponent and one of the girls' fathers, to The Washington Freedom Lighthouse. "She came over and told us she should vote for her. Our daughter told us she was a good man but we didn't agree with her politically... because she advocated women's right to choose abortion, we said we should donate her money to an anti-abortion career."
On August 8, Warren stopped on an Iowa campaign bus trip in front of a lemonade booth with two 11-year-old children: Siena Michels and Audrey Billings.
"Come to Haran City, Iowa, for a while before a lemonade stall. When life gives you lemons, there is a significant structural change!" Warren wrote on Twitter.
After the photo was released, the girl named Michels urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020. However, their parents explained Warren's position on abortion. The girls and their parents decided to contribute to the Foundation for Life Education and Defense, a non-profit organization that supports anti-abortion legislation.
Michels said: "My daughter tells us she wants us to vote for her." "We talked about abortion, saying maybe we should donate money to the anti-abortion cause.
Why Reclassification of Herpes and Zika Virus: The Effects of Biotechnology
Recent research suggests that the way people perceive viral structures needs to be realigned because they are actually more diverse than previously known, and these findings may have a significant impact on their classification, our understanding of how they form, evolve, and infect hosts, and how they can be designed to respond to vaccines.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began to obtain high-resolution images of the virus, discovering a detailed structure of the viral shell; the shell is an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein used to protect the genetic material of the virus. Most of the viruses' shells are typical quasi spherical shapes, presenting a twenty-sided symmetrical structure like a 20-sided dice.
The shell is the protective layer of the virus, and when scientists discover the structure of the shell, they suggest that the shell has different sizes and carries a different number of genomes so that the virus can infect its host in different ways.
Why is this important?
When designing drugs that target viruses, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve efficacy.
Two researchers at the Institute of Virus Information conducted a special study on the structure of the virus, one from San Diego State University's theoretical biophysicist Anthony Luke and another from York University's Mathematician Biologist Retton Diwalock concluded that many viruses have been largely misclassified for 60 years, including common viruses such as single herpes and Zika.
Although we have obtained structural images of low-temperature electron microscopy, the researchers did not mathematically describe different viral structures.
Luke said: "We have found six new forms of protein composition in the 20-sided shell. As a result, many viruses do not only use two widely known crust structures. At least eight methods can now be used to design their 20-sided shells."
The researchers used the generalization of parity principles to observe how proteins wrapped around twenty-face husks.
Their findings, which will be published in the journal Nature Communications on Friday, September 27, also show that viruses belonging to the same structural genealogy based on their composition of proteins would adopt a consistent twenty-face shell layout, which provides a new method for studying virus evolution.
biotechnological applications
Structural biologists can now use this information to reclassify the structure of the virus, which will help reveal the molecular and evolutionary relationship between different viruses.
It will also provide guidance for the design of new molecular containers for nanotechnology and biotechnology applications, as well as help scientists identify specific strategies for protein assembly in casings. This could provide a more systematic approach to developing antiviral vaccines.
Luke said: "We can use this discovery to target the assembly and stability of the casings to prevent viruses from forming when they are infected with host cells or decomposing them after it is formed. This may help identify and identify antiviral targets for viruses that share the same twenty-face layout."
This new framework accommodates previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the viral shell structure and identifies common geometric patterns in the long evolution of virus from humans to bacteria that infect all organisms.
The new blueprint also provides "a new perspective on the evolution of viruses, showing a new way in which larger and more complex viruses evolve from simple viruses at an evolutionary timescale."
Application of Buildings
Geometry can also be used for new building design and construction.
Inspired by the landmark dome designed by renowned architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologist Donald Kasper and biophysicist Alon Kruger introduced a geometric framework that has been categorized according to the geometry of the viral shell since the 1960s. However, with the gradual advancement of molecular imaging techniques, an increasing number of three-dimensional rebuilding of the virus's shells, including herpes and Zika, have separated themselves from this classic geometrical framework.
Luke explains: "This study will introduce a framework that is more general than the classic Caspa-Crugg structure. It is based on local aptitudes formed by proteins interacting inside the shell. This approach has found six new twenty-faced housing layouts, while restoring two classic layouts from Kaspa-Crugg's multifaceted Caspa-based."
Pastor of Violent Boys in Wisconsin sentenced to 30 years in prison
A former pastor accused of sexually assaulting a boy in Wisconsin decades ago was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Thomas Eriksen, 72, was sentenced to the highest prison term on Thursday and faced two charges of sexual assault against boys in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he served as a pastor at St Peter's Catholic Church.
Four men appeared in court on Thursday to testify about the impact of sexual assault on their lives, one of whom was for the first time publicly exposed.
Eriksen apologized to the victims in court, saying he began to realize the impact of his actions on the victims. At least 11 men claimed they had been assaulted during Eriksen's tenure as a pastor.
Erikson was revoked in 1988.
Ingesting too much of this condiment may damage the liver.
Cincinnamon made from the inner skin of cinnamon, is a popular blender, flavoring for various foods, and even itself has become a unique taste.
This ration has some impressive health benefits, such as reducing the risk of life-threatening diseases such as heart disease, cancer and even diabetes, so being welcomed is inevitable.
In this case, if the human body consumes too much cinnamon, there are some side effects. We should ensure safety.
According to animal studies, if too much cinnamon is consumed, it may increase the risk of cancer. Scientists say that in the long run, cinnamon can destroy our DNA and thus cause cancer.
Possibly damaging to the liver - according to studies, too much lavender intake can also lead to liver toxicity and damage. This is based on several studies on the effects of excess lavender intake on the human body.
It is presumably because cinnamon contains aldehyde, a compound that causes an allergic reaction to the human body after heavy intake. However, only people who are allergic to cinnamon can develop oral ulcers.
It can cause breathing problems - more than a common precaution, because cinnamon is delicate and easy to inhale, may cause coughing and vomiting, and cinnamonaldehyde also stimulates the throat.
This is very good, especially for those with high blood sugar.
Tennessee Abortion Waiting for Judges to Determine
In a 48-hour abortion waiting period in Tennessee, a federal judge must decide which expert to listen to.
During a four-day trial, which ended Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee tried to prove that the law requiring women to go to clinics at least 48 hours apart could give them time to reflect on their decision to abortion. The lawyers from five abortion clinics (the state's total of seven abortion clinics) argued that the law did not bring any benefits but would create enormous burdens.
Experts on both sides agreed that some women seeking abortions were in fact unthinkable, while some feminized women regretted their decisions afterward. But the experts' divergence is that this part of them accounted for a lot or less among women seeking abortion and whether Tennessee's 48-hour waiting period had any impact on these women.
On Thursday, the state's lawyers presented a study of Utah's 72-hour waiting period. The study found that eight percent of women who first went to clinics said they were no longer looking for abortion.
Anthony Biggs, a social psychologist at the University of California San Francisco, was asked about the study and agreed that certain women would change their thinking about abortion or they wouldn't have an idea at first. But she pointed out that the study did not prove to be forced waiting periods in Utah for women to change their minds nor found it to benefit women in other ways.
Biggs also confirmed that so far, there is no evidence that abortion can lead to mental health problems in women. She said a national study comparing women who successfully made abortions before the deadline with those who had passed the deadline and were rejected by clinics found no difference between rates of depression and post-traumatic stress.
During the cross-examination, Biggs noted that the study did not track the mental health outcomes of women who changed their minds after waiting periods, although only three such women were found in the study. She refuted the testimony of Prisila Coleman, a psychology professor at Bolling Green University, Ohio, earlier this week, who said abortion was linked to mental health problems.
Coleman testifies that most of the scientific literature related to abortion has a political tendency to support abortion.
On Thursday, a gynecologist and obstetrician in Memphis City testified to the state that he joined a highly controversial network organization trying to block abortion efficacy. The British doctor noted that through this work he "personally contacted women who changed their ideas about abortion."
Tennessee's waiting period law came into effect in mid-2015, and Pedrasa said he had witnessed a lot of women who wanted to block their effects after taking abortion pills.
The head of the clinic has previously confirmed that waiting periods can cause financial difficulties and pressure on women. The head also said that two requests for visits pose a coordination challenge for both patients and clinics, resulting in abortion postponed to far beyond the 48 hours required by law, which compels some women to seek surgical abortions, making them more likely to suffer complications.
According to the Gut Maher Institute, a research organization in support of abortion rights, 14 states across the United States have enacted laws requiring women seeking abortions to go to abortion clinics twice as long as Tennessee is one of them.
When deciding whether Tennessee's waiting period violates the U.S. Constitution, District Judge Bernard Friedman must determine whether it imposes an overburden on women seeking abortion. Some subjective criteria lead to some of the waiting periods laws being repealed and others continuing to be retained, depending on the state's actual situation.
Thursday, after the parties submitted their own evidence, Friedman said he would make a ruling as soon as possible.
The problem escalated, and the French chemical factory fires were extinguished.
Along with the stench spreading to large areas, French authorities and Normandy residents are cleaning up residues of chemical plant fires.
A lubricating oil plant in Rouen lost fire on Thursday and no injuries were sustained, but residents across the nearby Seine River expressed concern about potential health risks and consequences.
The head of the local administration said on Friday that after nearly 24 hours of effort, the fire was extinguished Thursday night.
French authorities have warned that after the fire was extinguished, a special smell could spread to neighboring areas.
French Interior Minister Christophe Castane said people with health problems should stay at home until Friday night.
The cause of the fire is under investigation, and the plant is listed as one of the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
LNG investment record in 2019 and China's highest growth
LNG investment has reached $50 billion since the beginning of the year, a record high level, said Fatih Birol, director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), at an industry conference.
"This year, 2019's investment volume broke the highest record (final investment decision) for the first time - $50 billion," Birol said at a liquefied natural gas producer-consumer conference in Tokyo, Reuters cited Birol's comments.
Unsurprisingly, the driving force behind investment growth is rising energy demand in Asia; China is expected to outpace Japan and become the world's largest liquefied natural gas importer.
"The largest growth comes from China. In the next five years, one-third of global demand for liquefied natural gas will come only from China," Birol said.
It's no surprise that the volume of investment has increased, with the U.S. and Canada completing most of its investments.
In a report released in December 2018, the U.S. Energy Information Agency said it was expected that by the end of this year US liquefied natural gas exports could double to 8.9 billion cubic feet per day. This would also make the United States the world's third largest liquefied natural gas exporter after Qatar and Australia.
Canada currently has only one ongoing liquefied natural gas project - Canadian liquefied natural gas - but its final annual capacity could reach 28 million tons. The project cost $31 billion and is led by Shell, with minority stakeholders including Malaysian National Oil Company, China Petroleum, Mitsubishi and South Korean Gas Corporation.
At the same time, Qatar is intensifying its efforts to maintain its top position in global competition for liquefied natural gas exports. Qatar and Iran are currently co-owners of the world's largest offshore gas fields - the northern gas fields, and Qatar has lifted a new drilling ban on this field with the goal of increasing annual export capacity by 43% to 11 million tons per year.
According to the world's leading business information service providers, global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to reach 550 million tonnes by 2030.
Viola Davis recorded the Jimmy Canmore Live Show, igniting a true heart-to-heart journey to play Michelle Obama's role.
Viola Davis feels some pressure to play Michelle Obama.
The actor said on Thursday in Jimmy Canmore Live Show: "I'm terribly scared."
It was announced last month that Davis would be the former first lady in a series of adaptations to The First Lady. Davis said the screenplay was great, but she acutely realized that it wasn't so easy to perform well.
"I don't care what I've achieved in my life, I've had an Emmy Award, an Oscar and two Tony Awards, but if I messed up this time, it will be a decisive moment of my life."
Davis said she was waiting for her PR staff to call and say, "Don't hang up, I am Michelle Obama - scolding you."
Davis also considered the audience in Season 6 (final season) of Atonement.
She said, "Listen, I don't want to make those who look at me crazy."
Judges care about drinking choices on the night of teen violence
A teenager who had committed violence against his foes was sentenced by the judge, while also expressing concern about the teenage boy's choice of drinking before he had perpetrated such violence.
19-year-old Kieran Cleveland beats a 17-year-old teenager, who considers the latter to be the culprit that led him to break up with his ex-girlfriend.
The Oxford Royal Court was informed that shortly before the violence in March, Clifton drank moderation at a fat fox bar in Wattlington, Oxfordshire.
Judge Nigel Dalley told Clifton, who confessed to causing actual bodily harm (ABH), that alcohol "played an important role" in the violence that night.
But he talked about Cleveland's choice of drinking: "Drinked Coca-Cola and Italian raspberries? I was surprised you weren't sick!"
Clifton from Chalgrove was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 12 months, ordered to complete a 15-day rehab and 160 hours of "unpaid work" and paid PS750 compensation.
"It sounds weird, but it's really fun: in the warmest world of news.
A pink blanket: Jane Austen classic novel, a strange young man's love show, fantasy fiction "Six Crows". Jordan Hiki's version was woven by her grandmother and appeared in most of the photos on her photo wall account tour page, with various books, giving an attractive sense of comfort. Now, do you want to get into the life of her pictures, roll this blanket, a cup of coffee, put it all down, read the new novel 'Be true in love'?
Hicky is a user of the "Chasin", which has been retweeted by more than 35 million photo wall posts, while popular Chasin bloggers have over 100,000 followers (compared with about 69,000 in the New York Times).
Colombian President Says Leader of National Crime Group Los Pelosi Killed
The top leader and founder of the Los Pelosos crime group was shot dead in an operation led by the Colombian National Police, President Ivan Duke declared on Friday.
The gang is one of the most famous criminal organizations in this Andean country, and the fighting involved has crippled hundreds of thousands of lives in the eastern part of the country's border with Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Kintro, another name Pacra, was a left-wing opposition who commanded more than 440 gang members.
Pacra, 49, who was wanted by police for terrorism and murder, positioned his whereabouts in North Santander on Thursday.
"Our goal is clear - to crush the organization completely," Ducker said in a statement that he had travelled to the United States this week to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations.
Kintro is responsible for organizing the killing of several human rights activists and community leaders, the statement added.
Duke has been criticised by some of the international community for failing to take more action to stop killings throughout the country.
Another boss of Los Pelosos was also arrested in the operation, the statement added, but it did not mention details of Kintro's death.
"How dare you do this?" Tongberry's speech at the UN inspires Dutch climate protestors
On Friday, thousands of Dutch youth strikers took part in the global climate change protest, blocking local traffic and questioning their leaders "How dare you do this"?
On 27 September 2019, in The Hague, Netherlands, a protestor held the portrait of Greta Tunbery, a Swedish activist for environmental protection, and called on the government to take action against climate change.
The number of marchers in The Hague exceeded expectations, with organizers estimated the number of protesters to be around 35,000. Police were forced to change the parade route and lead the protest team to places that could accommodate more people.
Tombery, 16, gave a passionate speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York this week. Millions of people around the world have joined climate change protests on Friday to boost the UN Climate Action Summit.
"When people continue to join the protests, strikes will have a great impact not only on today but also on the future, and we can see people from all walks of life involved," protestor Rendel Rustema said.
Protesters pierced the city centre, shouting flags and holding photographs of Belli on their hands with slogans that read: "For Greta's beauty," "Don't be like a stupid old antique," and "You die because of age, we are dying from climate change."
"I understand their concerns and believe that people have heard their calls," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Lutte told reporters in a weekly routine press conference, when the protesters marched near him. "We have put forward some costly plans to deal with these problems.
At the start of the Climate Action Summit, Thomberley's brief speech was horrified by a summit aimed at mobilizing governments and businesses to break the international community's paralyzed status of action on carbon emissions, despite decades of constant warning scientists about the effects of climate change that last year's global carbon emissions still reached record highs.
"It's all wrong. I shouldn't be sitting here. I should go to school on the other side of the ocean, but you are looking for our young people to hope." How dare you do this?" she said with a passion and trembling voice.
With 17 million inhabitants, the Netherlands accounted for less than 7% of its total energy generation using renewables in 2017, compared with Germany's 15% and Sweden's more than 50%.
The Dutch government has committed to halving carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 by 2030, but only achieved a 13% reduction by 2017.
On Friday, Tombery also participated in climate protests in Canada when the leaders of the United Nations Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) were meeting in Montreal to discuss emissions-reduction targets for the aviation transport industry.
Suicides have surged and the situation facing the military is unoptimistic
This year, suicide rates among active military personnel soared to historic highs and the continuation of this situation was very fatal, with Pentagon officials saying the situation was depressing and is currently actively responding.
On Thursday, Pentagon data released showed that suicide rates and total suicides in the Army, Navy and Marine Corps were rising, with only the Air Force declining. The number of suicides among reserve and National Guard members was also on the rise.
Earlier this month, the Navy reported that three crew members who served on the aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush had ended their lives in a week or so, highlighting difficulties with identifying servicemen and finding ways to prevent suicide.
When asked about the suicides of aircraft carriers, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said: "I hope I can tell you that we have found an answer to prevent future suicides in the armed forces.
The total number of suicides in the U.S. Army increased from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to the Pentagon, the highest risk factor is for young conscripts, at least 60% of whom choose firearms as a means of suicide.
Elisabeth van Vink, director of the Pentagon's military resilience office, said: "Our numbers don't go in the right direction." She said that treatment for most military personnel was not much different from civilians, adding: "It is difficult to be comforting."
The military and defence leaders expressed disappointment in that regard, and resolved to take additional measures to enhance the force's resilience, train its personnel on how to respond more effectively to stress, and encourage troop personnel to seek help when needed.
She and director of the Suicide Prevention Office Karen Oves said it was difficult to identify servicemen who might be in distress or have suicidal thoughts, sometimes a sudden impulse decision, with little warning beforehand. They said it was hard to find the cause of suicide because there were too many stressors that caused suicide.
They also acknowledged that servicemen were reluctant to seek help on their own initiative because they feared it would affect promotion or security checks. The military leaders said they had to work harder to address those issues seen as impeding development.
Marines Commander General David Berger said: "In addition to physical health, gun training, training and education, the Marines must also freely discuss life's difficulties, mental health and suicide issues. We must build a community where seeking help and assistance are important decisions made by marines and sailors."
This year, the Pentagon first took into account statistics on suicides among its spouses and families. Van Wink said the latest figures were in 2017, but officials are working to improve their ability to collect family-related data.
According to the data, 186 families committed suicide, of which 123 were spouses and 63 were family members between the ages of 12 and 23.
The vast majority (nearly 70 per cent) are female spouses under the age of 40, while 70 per cent of families who commit suicide are male. About half of those who commit suicide have reached the age of 18 and most of those who are younger are young people between the ages of 15 and 17.
Seth Meyers laughed dumbly in Donald Trump's "Tango and Cash" impression
Thursday, late night show host Seth Meyers brought a moment of relaxation for the week that had been very repressed due to mass shootings, he teased Donald Trump, but intermittently he couldn't help laughing himself.
The comedian mentioned the scenario of Trump's visit to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where victims of mass shootings over the weekend were being treated and his campaign was still owed more than $500,000 for a political rally in February.
The event also resulted in a one-time suspense owing to the failure to pay on time.
"This is a consistent reassignment by Mr. President, and I am surprised that his office desk was not flooded with unrecovered DVDs."
Then he began to imitate Trump in the 1989 hit film Tango and Cash, but soon he couldn't help.
After a bullet was found in the woman's skull, the man burst into prison.
A man in Georgia was sentenced to 25 years in prison for firing at his girlfriend, as his girlfriend realized when he went to hospital for headache treatment that he left a bullet in his head and survived.
According to news outlets, 39-year-old Gerantei Kane was sentenced Thursday on charges including a serious crime of possession of firearms when he attacked 42-year-old Nicole Gordon in 2017.
Gordon, who suffered from severe headaches and memory loss, was examined last year by a doctor who found one bullet in her skull.
Gordon told police that she did not remember being shot, but did remember the quarrel with Kane when her windows were broken and she fainted. She thought she had been injured by a broken glass; she was packed in his mother's home.
Men's fashion show in Paris Fashion Week T-Tai Show
As Miss Gaga sings in her 2008 hit song "Roman's Death," "Walk, walk, fashionable baby."
An editor said that a male model had taken those words into account, and his T-T shows blew the eyes of other models, and on Wednesday's Paris Fashion Week he served as the closing model for John Galliano Magira's Spring 2020 series.
The male model named Leon Daim, who is 20 years old, has conquered the audience with a unique T-Tai Magic Cat step, he takes an exuberant step, pushes his feet forward by force, uncontrollably, and maintains a strong determination in his eyes.
Dressed in a belt, white shorts and knee-long boots, he wore a pupil's hat. The form was heated online. In a cat walk video, the latter seemed to smile at him as he walked around Fashion Editor Anna Wintour.
Many have hailed the young German model, who has taken part in drafting campaigns by Gil Sander, Fay and South Korea's hard-fashioned menswear brands, famous for its unique sense of fashion.
Actor and Beverly Wife star Lisa Lina describes Leon as her "soul special", while fashion designer and singer Rihanna watches him on the Photo Wall app.
After the release of Lion's show video, a fan wrote on Leon's page: "This video and off-site is really too distinctive. Another fan also said that "Great Eleon", while makeup artist and tycoon Pat McGra provides makeup for his performance, as well as makeup artist in this performance, leaving him with flashes and flames.
The best acclaim may be Tim Brocks, a specialite editor of fashion business reviews from fashion websites.
"You're an undiscovered young man when you set off, but it's a hot-handed star back!" Blanks wrote in the title of Photo Wall app on Wednesday, citing this classic phrase in the movie Fourty-second Street.
He added, "@leondame makes the cat go great @maisonmargiela I think they're all true." No one is "like Damm!"
Earth-magnetic storms will occur in late September
According to the Space Weather Forecast Center of the National Institute for Atmospheric and Marine Research, geomagnetic disturbances are expected between September 27 and September 29. High-speed solar winds can lead to moderate geomagnetic storms (G2)
The Russian solar activity research laboratory at the Lebedev Institute predicts that the disturbance will begin on the night of September 27 and reach the strongest level by the next morning to noon. Planetary index can jump to 5 kp levels.
Geomagnetic storms can affect people with cardiovascular problems. Doctors warn that some may have angina, dizziness, headaches and inattention.
If more serious disturbances occur, the grid can also fluctuate. Satellite signals that provide navigational information will also be weak.
The spectacular aurora will appear in the sky above the two poles, which is the most beautiful sight of this phenomenon.
Sony works with Disney again to launch Spider-Man's third film
Disney and Sony are now pre-emptive, and Spider-Man's return is due.
The two companies announced Friday that they will co-star in the third film, Spider-Man, starring Tom Holland.
According to a press release issued by both parties, the unnamed film will be released on July 16, 2021, produced by Disney's Marvelfilm and its president, Kevin Finger.
According to the press release, Amy Pascal will also make films through Pasca's film industry, as she did in the first two films that lead starring Holland.
In a press release, Figer said: "I am very pleased that the Spider-Man tour will continue in Marvel's film universe and I can continue to do so. The whole of Marvelfilm is excited as well as myself. A powerful idolater and hero whose story spreads around the world and is loved by audiences of all ages."
The protocol also allows Spider-Man to appear in Marvel's future films.
Fig acknowledges that this collaboration has made the ability to fly through the wall unique among superheroes.
"Spider-Man is exactly the only hero with superpower and can cross the movie universe, so as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprises the future will bring.
More than a month after the end of Spider-Man's stalemate, it was reported that the two companies were unable to reach an agreement on the continuation of previous films "The Return of Heroes" and "Hero Expedition."
The stumbling block is that Disney, who owns the role, wants to co-finance with Sony in future films, and has reached an agreement prior to the acquisition of Marvel by Disney, which was founded in 2009 by Mickey Mouse.
The Hollywood reporter points out that there are good reasons for both sides to work together. Hero Expedition is Sony's highest box office ever, while Marvel can maximize the promotion of goods and maintain creative control.
Glad to the end of the stalemate was also Holland himself, who expressed his own joy on the Photo Wall application software.
EU and UK negotiators work in Belgium to reach a Brexit deal
The EU's chief negotiator for Brexit began negotiations with British officials in Belgium on Friday to reach a Brexit deal, which is about a month away from the agreement's deadline.
Michelle Barnier met with Brexit minister Stephen Buckley in Brussels, who insisted that any agreement would exclude Ireland's "border protection measures," which actually ensured a soft border between post-Brexit Ireland and Northern Ireland, becoming the main obstacle to negotiations.
Barkley said that while the UK is committed to a deal, he says there's less time left.
"I think there's still a long way to go, I think, and it's the crucial moment for negotiations," Buckley said.
The deadline for Brexit is Oct. 31, but a new law bans British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from completing Brexit without a trade deal and does not allow the British Parliament to approve Brexit without a trade deal by October 19.
Last week, EU negotiators said they were willing to accept an alternative to border protection measures, but Ireland's representative Simon Kovenny said last Friday that the London side had not yet submitted a "serious" proposal.
He said: "Unless there is a serious proposal as the basis for negotiations, huge differences at present will continue to exist."
The negotiators also said that "it's not enough time," and the British Prime Minister and his team have a responsibility to come up with a serious proposal.
Johnson's office said Friday that the deal was still "difficult."
"From the Irish point of view, we certainly think it's better to defer Brexit than a no-deal Brexit," Kovenny said, "but I think there are good reasons behind asking for an extension."
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Barnier are doing everything they can to reach an agreement that is wrong in the UK if it fails.
Ireland's Prime Minister Varadka said he was pessimistic about whether a Brexit deal could be reached, but he would urge British leaders to come up with a plan at the Brexit summit on October 17.
"The Brexit deal is actually an international treaty," Varadka said, "it's not something that can be tweaked or cobbled up late at night."
The puzzle of scientists: giant planets orbiting tiny stars
Scientists have discovered that in a solar system galaxy 30 light-years away, a huge wooden planet orbits tiny red dwarfs, completely subverting the existing theory of planetary formation.
The gas giant GJ 3512b orbits the main star of a red dwarf, which was released on September 26, 2019.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets orbiting them, but this observed star is not very different from the size of the planet, the researchers said on Thursday.
The star, GJ 3512, is about 12% of the Sun's mass, and the planets orbiting it are almost half that of Jupiter (the largest planet in the solar system).
"Yes, that's too surprising," said Juan Carlos Morales, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Space Science in Catalan Spain, whose team led him to publish the results of this study in the journal Science.
"This discovery is surprising because theoretical modeling suggests that low-mass stars typically have asteroids like Earth or small Neptune. But this time we found a Jupiter-like gaseous giant orbiting a very low-mass star," Morales added.
Using a telescope at the Kalaato Observatory in Spain, researchers discovered this mostly gas-like planet that orbits the main star along an elliptical orbit for 204 days.
The mass of red dwarfs is small and the surface temperature is relatively low.The GJ 3512 is not only a lot smaller than the sun, it can be compared to even larger planets, and the GJ 3512 is only 35% bigger than Jupiter.
"Red dwarfs emit less energy, so the light is very faint and their surface temperature is also low, about 3,800 (degree) Kelvin (6,380 Fahrenheit/3,527 C). This also explains why red dwarfs are microred," Morales said.
There is evidence that another planet orbits the red dwarf, and there may also be a planet being dumped out of this star line, which explains the orbital elliptical shape of the type of wooden planet," Morales said.
The planets and their surrounding stars were born in the same disc of interstellar gases and dust. According to the most widely accepted model of planetary formation "the core accretion model", the bodies originally formed solid particles within the disk, and the gravitational pull of the planet's embryos could collect the gas around them into an atmosphere.
Another model relative to it is called the gravitational instability model, which may explain this unusual galaxy.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disks around young stars may be larger than expected in mass and have a slightly lower temperature," Morales noted. "This will make the disc unstable, resulting in some dense regions forming clusters that can grow until collapsing to form planets."
Schools all over the world are knocking on the streets demanding climate action
On Friday, children around the world launched another wave of school strikes calling for action on climate change, their first major move since this week's issue has become a top-notch on the agenda of United Nations world leaders.
More than a year ago, the Swedish teenager Greta Sangerberg's solo "Friday Tomorrow" campaign sprung up and millions of students walked into the streets of cities such as New York City drew attention from developing countries in Africa.
The initial protests began in New Zealand, where organizers estimate that 170,000 people marched across the country.
Friday's protests were held after a week-long climate talks at the United Nations in New York, including a speech by Mr. Sengberg that harshly condemned world leaders for their inaction.
"You stole my dreams and childhood with your empty words," she said on Tuesday. "The eyes of future generations are staring at you, and if your choice disappoints us, I can say that we will never forgive you."
Demonstrators cited a report endorsed by the United Nations last year calling on governments to take steps to prevent global temperatures rising above 2.7 degrees, warning scientists that it would have terrible consequences for human life and Earth.
Sandberg and young people inspired by her said they would not stop the weekly class slams until they saw a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that led to climate change.
In Abuja, Nigeria's capital, Oradosu Adinek strikes on Friday for 46 consecutive occasions. The activist posted a number of images on Twitter showing the students wearing blue uniforms and banners with slogans "Climate change is really happening" and "we don't have much time."
In August, in Lausanne, Switzerland, hundreds of climate strike organisers gathered to prepare for this week's event and thousands marched in the city.
Thousands of people are expected to walk on the streets of Helsinki, Finland, with local media reporting that schools in Helsinki will allow students to participate.
Sandberg remains in North America after visiting the United Nations and plans to participate in a climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams is fined $10,000 for alleged damage to Wimbledon tennis court
Tennis legend Serena Williams was fined $10,000 for allegedly using a slap to disrupt London's practice venue.
According to the Associated Press and CNN, Winnet's All-British Club organisers issued a fine for Williams because of allegedly causing damage in an outdoor exercise on June 30.
The 37-year-old tennis star was interviewed by reporters after winning the quarterfinal against Alison Rees on Tuesday, and she seemed to laugh at the fine.
When asked about the fine, she said: "To be honest, I didn't really want to spoil the stadium. I just threw a slap and then was fined."
Williams said she didn't know how it would damage the stadium.
She told reporters: "I mean, if you can tell me how the damage was caused, I will be grateful. I've always been a man of inner vengeance. Maybe I am very strong but I don't know."
Williams is vying for the eighth windshield title, when she will receive her 24th Grand Slam. In Thursday's one-time semifinal, she will fight against Czech player Gbagola Strikova.
Last year, a U.S. Open referee accused Williams of infringing with the coach during the game, which Williams defended and was thus fined $17,000.
In the incident, the referee sent three irregularities to Williams: the first was that she received illegal guidance, the second was that she interrupted a slap because of emotional frustration, and the third was that she called each other "thieves" when she confronted the referee.
Many Williams fans claim that the referee's reaction was too harsh on her, especially when it comes to a situation where male players have been thrilled throughout sports history.
"Do you know how many men do worse than this?" Williams told the U.S. Open officials who entered the stadium after a standoff with the referee during the game.
Williams wasn't the only person to be fined at this year's Winter Net Open, but her fine was the highest.
Italian footballer Fabio Fanini said after Saturday's loss to U.S. player Tannis Sandgren in the third round of the game, "Should have exploded on the tennis court" and was fined $3,000.
Australian player Nick Kirgios was fined two times for violating sports ethics, one of them $3,000 and the other $5,000.
The band suspended last night's concert: Friday and Sunday performances were canceled
The 75-year-old singer told the disillusioned audience: "I think it's best to be good." The band has already performed eight songs, but promises to return one day.
After playing the classic 1982 track "The Front Line of Excellence", Daltre announced his withdrawal. He had always had voice problems, apparently strictly following the advice of his surgeons.
The British giant told the audience that he could not complete the performance: "If I continue to perform for you, I'll get hurt. I think it would be best to have a good reception... last time I was staying in the hospital for a month and I don't want to go anymore."
Pete Thomson explained to the audience: "It looks like he can't continue performing, I'm afraid..."
The band left the stage and originally intended to work on completing the rest of the show without Roger.
When he returned, Thomson said: "I really, really sorry. Roger is now out of the sound."
"Obviously, before the show he saw a doctor and you know that he sang well in the tour. I don't know what happened.
"I'm really sorry you couldn't watch the show tonight...we were missing, it was Roger's performance and bad state."
The audience fully supported him, cheering for his 74-year-old, who explained everything that had happened and how the band wanted to return to fulfill their commitment to the show.
"We will announce the date of our return as soon as possible," said Thomson, "and I'll explain...we play one day and rest a day because Roger's surgeon insisted he was going to rest a day."
"I swear to you that we will come back and we won't let the tickets you bought fall short. I love you, sorry for disappointing you."
After the show, the upcoming Friday and Sunday evening concerts in Dallas and Denver were canceled.
Their next show will take place in San Francisco on October 9, and the band will begin their British tour in Manchester on March 16, 2020.
Michael Schumacher's broker makes a statement on his physical condition
Official statements about Michael Schumacher's health have been issued. According to Gong.bg, the legend has been recovering for nearly six years after being injured in an alpine ski accident in 2013.
A few weeks ago, global media reported that the former pilot had been admitted to a hospital in Paris for treatment. The longtime broker and old friend of Schumacher's family, Sabin Kohm, made a statement.
"Michael's health isn't a public issue, so we won't comment on it just because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible. We know that this is hard to understand for some people, but we do it exactly according to Michael's will and very thank you for understanding."
She also revealed that Schumacher was a very sensitive person who did not want his name to appear in headlines or even avoid public appearances before the incident.
The broker called on everyone not to believe in any photos that were "spilled" from social networks and yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities investigating a fatal car crash in the Los Angeles National Forest and have found bodies
On Thursday afternoon, police are investigating a fatal car crash in the Los Angeles National Forest.
According to police, a car was found below the Los Angeles Forest Highway and Grand Tugong Canyon Road with bodies inside.
Initial reports suggest the car may have been there for some time.
It is not clear how the vehicle was found.
Is the nuclear-free world remote?
Seventy-four years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands.
Since then, as long as there is a conflict between major powers, the threat of nuclear war will follow.
While various treaties are trying to curb this threat, today there are about 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.
Thursday is the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons seems increasingly difficult to achieve.
So, do States have the political will to abolish nuclear weapons?
Meghan "moves with his heart" and insists on not "giving up" his pursuit while performing royal duties.
Meghan Markle decided to "move with her heart" and insisted on not "abandoning" her pursuit while performing royal duties, as a member of the royal family, she wanted to be a model for young boys and girls.
The 38-year-old Duchess of Sussex reportedly made the above remarks earlier this week during a campaign to inspire women entrepreneurs at the Cape Town Woodstock Exchange while visiting South Africa with her husband Prince Harry.
The Woodstock Exchange is a UK-South Africa technology hub that promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, gain access to skills, resources and support.
At the meeting of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, the 38-year-old former actress met with several women's founders in tech, environmental protection and fashion industries to praise them for "inspiring the next generation" of creative thinking.
In a conversation with women's tech founders, Meghan vigorously advocated empowering young women and girls, expressing the hope that younger men will also be empowered.
South African engineer, social entrepreneur, engineering co-founder and mother of two children Nadia Muzaji revealed: "We recognize the importance of not only education for girls but also to be a role model for boys, we are influential women and should be an example that boys admire."
"Both of us have sons and we must remember that we are not only the example of girls, but also the example of boys, not just our sons, but also the masses."
She added that we did not "feel any hierarchy" because Meghan's attendance, as it was a "women's party," talking about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to accomplish in moving forward, growing and transforming our society."
Modis Modice, the founder of Skills Training Company Simodisa, said that although Meghan was a royal member, she was determined to continue moving with her heart without abandoning her deep-seated pursuit.
"She talked about the responsibility of being a mother and a duchess, as well as fulfilling her inner aspirations, not because it was the duchess, to give up pursuit," Modice recalled.
"You have to be faithful to yourself."
She said that the Duchess urged them to continue to cultivate their new ideas and to say how they would continue to advance and move forward, clarifying that they did so in order to set an example for others.
Modis added that she was not referring to being a member of the royal family, but rather to doing so when confronted with challenges in everyday life, and acknowledged herself feeling a little "awesome" about Meghan.
"She emits an elegant temperament and is taking this task in such a graceful gesture," Modis said.
"As founders, many of us have created amazing results, but meeting with a royal family member is somewhat daunting.
Meghan also revealed that she enjoyed the pressure of being a professional mother, admitting that she felt it was "heavy" but "very exciting" to be a member of the royal family and take care of her children.
Meghan told CEO and mother of two children Laura Rosmarlin: "It's only five months now for me to be a mom. As a professional mother traveling with a child, my God, how troublesome it is, but all this is so exciting."
"Sometimes you have to deal with something addictive, but when you meet some people and can positively influence them, you'll say 'Ah,' all worth it."
Meghan then went to the city's motherland agency, which trained and hired women with HIV.
She brought some of Archie's baby clothes, including a "future" clothing and his no longer fitned infant uniform with the word "invincible," as well as items donated by her mother's friend.
A couple of parents were sentenced to six years in prison for putting a 5-month-old baby inside the suitcase and throwing it into a trash can.
A 5-and-a-half-month-old baby's body was thrown into a trash can and his parents were sentenced to six years in prison on Thursday without any objection to the infant's death charge.
Los Angeles County District Attorneys have announced that neither Adam Manson, 34, nor Kayana Williams, 32, did not defend a felony charge of child abuse and pleaded guilty to a special accusation that they caused the death of their son, Jacques Manson.
Both Manson and Williams initially pleaded guilty to these allegations.
Prosecutors said the two found their son dead on New Year's Eve, when they were drugging at a motel in southern Los Angeles. The prosecutor added that they placed the child's remains in suitcases and then threw them into rubbish bins near Baldwin Hill Clenshaw Square.
In late April, after weeks of searching for the Corona Elsobrand landfill, authorities cancelled the search. The child's body was never found.
Police said in a statement at the time that they decided to end their search for Jacquesson with "severe heart," but noted that because they were unable to locate exactly where it was located, "there is no reasonable reason to continue searching."
Britain's drug supply without a deal remains unclear
UK government regulators say that if there is no agreement to Brexit, the government still needs to complete "a lot" of work to ensure a sufficient supply of medicine in the country.
In a report released on Friday, the National Audit Office said that additional government leased trans-British Channel cargo capacity could not take place until late November (a month after the Brexit deadline of October 31). There are about 12,300 licensed drugs in the UK, including 7,000 from or through the EU, most of them across the Straits.
According to the "reasonably worst" scenario predicted by the British government, drug shipments could halve on the first day of uncoordinated Brexit and may take a year to recover. Time is said to be "extremely urgent" if transport issues are to be resolved before the end of October.
As of September 20, suppliers reported that 72% had six-week reserves.
"If there is no agreement to Brexit, the UK (health) sector will work in highly uncertain situations and have a huge difficulty in fully implementing its intended program," the government regulator wrote.
Meg Cyril, chairman of the Supervisory Audit Office, expressed "deep concern" about the contents of the report, saying she had seen the British government "numerous times" missing the deadline, but this was particularly worrying.
"If the government screwed up this time, it could have serious consequences," she said.
Dr. Richard Tobert of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association said that while companies are preparing for Brexit, "some things are uncontrolled."
If the UK really wants to leave without a deal, it will also require businesses to know more about how to use the additional cargo capacity prepared by the government.
"The best way to protect patients is to ensure a (Brexit) agreement."
Cleveland Police are labelled as "failure" in all respects
The scandal-stricken Cleveland Police have become the first police force to be labeled "failure" in all respects by inspectors.
Her Majesty &apos; s Police, Fire and Rescue Service Inspectorate has assessed its work in the overall and three key areas, which have reviewed its ability to reduce crime, safeguard people &apos; s safety, operate efficiently and treat the public and employees.
The findings suggest that special measures should be put in place for the Force, with police chiefs, police officers and crime commissioners interviewed by the National Commission and asked them to ensure implementation of "significant improvements" plans.
If there is no improvement, the Home Secretary can intervene to resolve this issue.
A series of scandals have plagued the team, including Hatelpur, Reedkar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesburg in the north-eastern United Kingdom.
Over the years, six police chiefs have been replaced.
In 2012, former sheriff Sean Price was fired for serious misconduct; after the journalists' phone calls were illegally intercepted, seven police officers were under investigation and complaints of racial discrimination persisted in the team.
Recently, the Inspector General of Police said that the police's working methods were "unimaginable inefficiencies" and they had to share laptops and cameras with them.
British police inspector Phil Gomley said it was a "failed force" and that the situation had become increasingly "grave" for nearly two years.
Tis Valley Mayor Ben Hoachen said the report "was the worst police force in the country's history" and "finally officially confirmed," adding that the interior ministry now needs to intervene."
He added: "There is no dispute. This is the fact that white paper black words are described in this report."
"These results are the most painful and shocking part of what I've read."
Cleveland is one of the 15 units recently inspected by HMICFRS inspectors, and the only unit not qualified in all fields.
Gomley added: "The Force did not give due priority to crime prevention; lacked strategic direction and insufficient resources allocated for defence efforts... failed to adequately protect vulnerable groups such as children. Lost the opportunity to protect them and put them at risk."
He said senior leaders did not consistently demonstrate "moral behavior" and that the misconduct of senior leadership in Cleveland is very serious and is affecting the effectiveness and efficiency of the force.
He added: "The force is not consistently fair and respectful of its employees, nor does it communicate or understand effectively with the staff; processes are considered unfair and inadequately understood to support them."
Despite the seriousness of the findings, the Force has indeed received some commendation in dealing with serious and organized crime, but it must improve its methods of investigating crimes.
Police and crime commissioner Barry Cobinger said: "I am very concerned about the troubling part of this report.
"The recent performance of this force is too poor."
He said he had secured the assurances of current sheriff Richard Lewis that as soon as he realized these mistakes, he would take "expeditious action" immediately.
Britain's interior ministry has ordered Kobinger to respond to the report within 56 days.
Lewis said the report was like "setting a line" for the force, adding that "improvements have been made and I am fully responsible for driving these clearly needed changes." During my five months in office, I met with distinguished police officers and staff at all levels to see the first-line police's efforts and determination to protect lives and vulnerable populations."
If there is no significant improvement fast enough, the government may intervene like renovating a collapsed prison.
But so far, politicians have never asked the police force to enforce this measure, inspectors said.
Crime, Security and Fire Minister Keith Marthaus said he encouraged the sheriff to "take prompt action to address these missteps and will closely monitor the position," adding that "transparency and accountability are key to building public trust in police."
Emanelli Christian School: Several sixth-grade boys in Virginia accused of trapping black girls for forced clippings
A black junior high school student in Virginia accused three white boys of trapping her and cutting off her braids. The incident occurred at the Emanelli Christian School, where Vice President Mike Pence's wife Karen Pence taught.
Amy Allen, a 12-year-old student who attended this 12-year private Christian school, said the boys caught her on the playground while resting in the class, saying that her braids were ugly and rolled, and then cut off her braids.
Amarie told CBS's WUSA-TV with tears, "They kept laughing at me and insulting me. They said I was 'ugly', 'I shouldn't have been born'. They said I wanted to get someone else's attention."
According to reports from WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth, another captured her hands behind Amari, and a boy clipped her braids with his scissors.
Amari didn't tell her family about it until her grandma discovered that her hair was shortened.
"When they laughed and ran away, I just sat there," Amari said.
The incident took place on Monday, but the shy child said she didn't tell her family until Wednesday because her grandmother noticed that her hair had changed. She said she was afraid of being reprised after telling herself the truth.
Emily's grandmother, Cynthia Allen, said: "It is so heartbreaking that I hope the school will be able to fire these students.
Amari's family spends nearly $12,000 a year attending the school, and Karen Pence is also famous for being an art teacher at this prestigious anti-gay school earlier this year.
"We attach great importance to the psychological and physical health of our students and adopt a zero-tolerance policy for any form of bullying or violence. We are deeply disturbed by these allegations, we are currently communicating with the victims' families, collecting information and doing everything we can to support them."
Although the school has adopted a zero-tolerance policy on bullying, Amarie said the boys had tortured her before. She said they had taken her lunch and scolded her earlier.
Amari's family met with school officials on Thursday, and the investigation continues.
Iran releases British tanker Stanna Ambrio
Iran released a British-flagged tanker last Friday, two months after it was detained for allegedly entering Iranian waters in violation of international law.
According to Iran's National News Agency, the Iranian Port and Maritime Authority confirmed that the tanker named Stanna Anprio had left the port of Abbas at 9 a.m.
Eric Hannell, president and CEO of the Swedish oil company (the ship's operator), also confirmed that the vessel had been released.
Eric Hannell tweeted: "Swedish oil companies and the British Northern Seas Authority confirmed that Stanna Anprio and its crew had been released."
On July 19, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards seized it on suspicion of violating international maritime law entering Iranian waters in the Strait of Hormuz.
However, the seizure of the ship was widely seen as a retaliation for Iran's British army, which seized a tanker in Gibraltar Sea suspected of transporting Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions law. Although the Trump administration has made every effort to extend its detention time, it was released in mid-August.
According to the New York Times, Stanna Annprio was officially authorized to leave on Monday but has been stranded in the port until the investigation of the vessel's behavior ended.
"The tanker has left the port of Abbas and is heading to Dubai for a crew to take medical checks and report," Harnell said, "and the crew's family have been informed that the company is currently arranging an early repatriation of its important crew."
The tanker was a victim of an escalation in tensions near the Persian Gulf, where the United States and Iran shot down each other's drones close to the Persian Gulf, and at least two were bombed, with the Trump administration accusing Iran of being responsible for the matter.
The Trump administration recently accused Iranian drones of attacking Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, and Tehran denied any involvement in the matter.
Prime Minister Modi paid tribute to Jacques Chirac on Twitter, calling him a true global politician and friend of India.
Indian Prime Minister Modi expressed condolences to the death of former French President Jacques Chirac, saying that India mourned the death of a true global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who expressed support for India after conducting nuclear tests in 1998, died Thursday at the age of 86. From 1995 to 2007 he served as president of France.
"I deeply mourn the passing of Jacques Chirac. India mourns the death of a true global politician. Prime Minister Modi said on Twitter that, as an Indian friend, he played a decisive role in building and building a strategic partnership for Indo-Faculty.
In January 1998, India and France established a strategic partnership during their first visit to India by Jacques Chirac. He visited the country again as president in 2006.
Jacques Chirac is said to have been ill-healthy for a long time.
Uganda: Government launches HIV oral self-test kit
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has launched an HIV oral self-test kit designed to ensure that citizens, especially male citizens, are able to carry out HIV testing.
The plan aims to reduce the number of new HIV-infected people by 2020.
OraQuick HIV oral self-test kits produced by Orasure Technologies are designed specifically for vulnerable groups such as young people aged 18 to 24, adult men and sex workers.
"Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are our current target population. Young people in this age group are our focus, and certainly any person over the age of 18 should be taken into consideration; we currently have no evidence of infection by minors under the Constitution, but as more and more evidence emerges, we will move towards that goal. For men, we'll give their reagent boxes to their mothers and then to their sexual partners, mainly vulnerable groups such as sex workers," said Mr. Jeffrey Tasy, head of HIV testing services technology officer yesterday.
Easy to use
The previously provided self-examination kit needs to be tested through blood, but the HIV oral self-examination kit can be detected through oral fluids.
If the human body is infected with HIV, the virus's antibodies will be present in blood and saliva.
According to data from the Uganda AIDS Commission, there are 1,000 new cases of HIV infection and 500 deaths per week in Uganda, which means an additional 53,000 infections and 23,000 deaths per year.
Dr. Diana Atvan, Permanent Secretary-General of the Ugandan Ministry of Health, said the product was launched very timely and would help humanity better fight AIDS.
However, she called on men to take HIV testing seriously.
She added that 14% of people still don't know they are infected with HIV, and more work is needed to take care of this segment.
"Currently, 86% of people living with HIV know their situation, which means that the remaining 14% are not aware of their condition. So the question now is how we should use this innovative technology.
However, health officials have warned that eating is strictly prohibited within 15 minutes before testing.
Mr. Tasi said the relevant studies showed no suicides and that the Ministry of Health was confident in avoiding such possible tragedies, as testing was a voluntary act.
Dr. Attwan said that in addition to educating users through images and videos, government and private institutions (including all pharmacy) should also provide 24-hour free telephone consulting services.
Studies show that HIV-infected and non-infected individuals tested through the OraQuick HIV self-test kit have a more than 99% accuracy of their results.
Qatar World Cup Athletes Feel High
At the athletics World Championship, which opened on Friday, several contestants have already met their most challenging opponents: Qatar's hot and dull weather.
The humidity in Doha is suffocating, with daytime temperatures hovering around 38 degrees Celsius, and athletes and athletics officials are discussing the weather in Doha, which is why they worry about some events.
Marathons and races are held at midnight, minimizing the adverse effects of high temperatures.
Although the impact of high temperatures on players competing in the Caliphate International Stadium will be smaller, because there is air conditioning in the interior and the temperature is maintained at about 21 degrees, but since the training venues are located outdoors, relevant players still need to adjust their training arrangements.
"We're also from tropical climate countries, but this is nothing more than anything," Bahamian coach Ronald Cartwright told Reuters.
"Here, you walk outside like someone who's given you a warm-up. I guess that's why the half-night game is open."
Athletics officials promised to provide more medical and safety measures for marathoners and racers.
International Sexual Athletic Movement Management Organization - IAAF said the women's marathon, originally scheduled for midnight on Friday, would take place as planned because temperatures are expected to be less than 30 degrees or around 30 degrees.
The agency said its medical representatives have assured athletes that they will monitor weather conditions throughout the day and report to their teams "to ensure that the event runs at an acceptable level of health risk."
Athletics who participated in the indoor competition said that the impact of high temperatures on their performance should not be too great, but they also acknowledged that training was particularly exhausting.
"I was shining when I was training because the humidity was too high here, and I sweated so much," said Rai Benjamin, a 400-meter columnist.
"Just like I just finished my bathing, but I don't think the situation should be too bad because there is air conditioning in the room."
The 2016 Olympic champion and lead player Ryan Claus said he had to heat the ball to about 38 degrees Celsius each time in order to prevent it from becoming wet during training in high-temperature, high-humid environments.
"The usual temperature of a lead ball is much lower than the dew point, and as soon as you get it out, it's wet and dripping water," said the American athlete. "It's worse than heavy rain... we've been overcoming this."
European champion Amanda Duprandis regularly participates in hot weather in southern Louisiana, and he says that it turns out that wet weather is very helpful for training because the talc powder on his hand "makes gripping more secure" after water.
But for other stick jumpers with commonly used adhesive sprays that enhance grip, in this humid state, they are more difficult to grasp the pole, he said.
"I understand that people who use sticky sprays are going to have some problems because the touch will become slippery and muted," Duplantis added.
The locksmiths were arrested, and the main prison security breach was alarming.
Recently, a British prison locker was arrested for fearing that the keys of the prison cell were copied and taxpayers were spending PS500,000 to replace all the locks in the cell.
Fearing that a copy of the keys would be sold to some of the 1,400 prisoners in prison, Her Majesty's Prison Vance Worth reported on police.
This suspected security breach will lead to the replacement of 3,000 locks, possibly locked in cells, inside and outside.
On 13 September, the police arrested a man of about forty years old who was suspected of misconduct in public office. The man came from southwestern London to work at Government Facilities Services Limited, which provides maintenance services for 52 prisons in southern England.
Police investigations have sparked concerns that some key marks may remain in clay before the real key replicas are made.
However, the prison chiefs stressed that they did not find any evidence of any prisoner's access to keys.
Wanzworth Prison is a Class B prison in southwestern London that can accommodate up to 1,628 prisoners and is one of the largest in Western Europe.
A spokesman for the Prisons Authority said: "Her Majesty's prison, Wanzworth, has raised the safety level of the gates and is currently undergoing special identification checks due to a security incident.
House President Warns Trump to Stop Attack on Whistleblowers
"The President's remarks today constitute intimidation of witnesses and should be severely condemned, which hinders congressional impeachment investigations. We condemn the president's attacks and call on our Republican colleagues to denounce them as Congress must do everything possible to protect this whistleblower and all whistleblowers."
"Trump is now fully aware that our Committee is seeking testimony from the whistleblower and others referred to in the 'Cliffs' Complaints' published today in the House Impeachment Investigation, and our country's laws prohibit any act of dissuading, intimidating witnesses or otherwise exerting pressure on witnesses in order to prevent them from providing testimony to Congress."
They added: "Any official who understands the Commission's investigation - including the subject of whistleblower complaints - will not be subjected to any intimidation, reprisal or threat of retaliation and all witnesses must be able to testify before Congress."
The statement was issued on Thursday, and the week coincided with a " whistleblower complaint" that sparked outrage in Washington, which alleged Trump's abuse of official power in the upcoming 2020 elections "to seek Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky's intervention," while White House measures masked it.
There is no evidence that Joe or Hunter Biden were wrong.
Just before the whistleblowers filed "the whistleblower's complaint" with lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his oath and officially launched an impeachment investigation into the president.
Michelle Obama praised Megan Marker for his "inspired" photowall app
Michelle Obama gave a cordial speech on the Photo Wall application Thursday, giving great praise to Meghan Markle, calling the Duchess of Sussex "a thoughtful leader who is breaking the stereotypes and making the world a better place."
The Duchess and Prince Harry are currently carrying his beloved son, Archie Harrison Montbatten-Winza, on a 10-day royal trip to South Africa, who earlier this week have taken part in a youth reception and met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
The former First Lady of the United States wrote enthusiastically in the post: "Thanks to my friend, Her Royal Highness Princess Sussexroyal, you are a thoughtful leader who is breaking the stereotypes and making the world a better place."
Michelle Obama added: "Whether meeting with our Obama Foundation leader @ObamaFoundation or helping girls around the world seek education, she has inspired many people."
Meghan, who was a special editor of the British Fashion magazine, interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine's September issue. The two ladies were delighted to recount their experiences as mother-in-law and her changes.
Michelle Obama said in an interview: "Motherhood has always been a master's class to learn to let go.
As a mother, I understand that most of the time my duty is to provide children with space for exploration and development so that they can become what they want to be. It's not how I want them to look like or what I want to be when I am at the corresponding age, but rather their deep-seated true self.
Michelle Obama, aware of the pressures placed under the global spotlight, gave her some advice to the Duchess in an interview with The Good Butler magazine.
"The pressure that I feel from myself and others can sometimes be very high, so my biggest advice is to be lenient and don't hurry to do anything."
She continued:
"I've been worrying about my daughters in the White House for the first few months to make sure they have a good start at school and meet new friends, so I put myself into more promising work.
The hero's moment: the police officer rushed to busy speed and rescued the hit puppy
It was a hero's moment when a policeman rushed to the busy highway and rescued an injured puppy.
Videos taken by Joseph Pughria's car recorder show that the puppy jumped off a police car within seconds of being hit by another vehicle by Joseph Pughria.
The police officer working in Pyrenees Park, Florida, wrapped the injured puppy with a first aid blanket, put on his own off-road car and quickly sent to the nearest animal hospital.
Pughria told the ABC News: "It's not until I see a puppy start breathing that my mood really gets better."
Thank goodness, this puppy survived only a slight scratching.
The police officer said: "We gave him a nickname 'lucky', and I think the name is just right here."
The puppy was sent to the local animal shelter, and its rescuers were hailed as heroes.
But Pgria insists he's just doing his own job.
The police officer added that if the animal service center failed to find the owner of the puppy, his family was very happy to give "lucky" a home.
After WeWork's bankruptcy, the initial public offering market stalked unprofitable companies.
Boston (Reuters) - The company's first-time show in the U.S. stock market echoed smoothly, especially when they were losing, which cast a shadow on the calendar for the remainder of this year's initial public release.
Surprisingly, the sudden postponement of WeWork's initial public offering highlights how market confidence in companies and investors seeking financing is being eroded.
The more provocative market for first-time public offerings continued to punish Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON.O) on Friday, the day it began trading and the fitness company's stock fell to $24.74, a 4 percent drop from Wednesday's first-time public offering price.
In the past, open market investors often expected companies to make a profit about 18 months after their initial public offering. This timeline has been relaxed as capital operators are eager to add fast-growing revenue businesses to their portfolios.
However, recent deals seem to show that uncertainty about the economic outlook is making investors more discerning in their willingly supported losses.
Peloton's report says that in the fiscal year ended June 30, company revenue grew rapidly and reached a growth rate of 110 percent. But the company's operating leverage was also negative, with operational spending skyrocketing by 147 percent over the previous year.
SmileDirectClub (SDC.O) was the first dental correction company in the United States to be listed earlier this month. The research firm's data on revitalizing capital shows that for three years, initial public offerings will exceed the target range and close down on the first trading day.
The average return on initial public offerings in 2019 is currently around 9%, down from 30% at the end of June and about two weeks ago.
In the U.S., most of the third quarter's focus was on an unfulfilled deal - a first public offering planned by WeWork parent company We Company.
The company originally planned to make an initial public offering earlier in September, but postponed the listing until later in 2019, then replaced its CEO and said it was reviewing the listing schedule.
Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), an entertainment and talent brokerage company supported by Hollywood heavyweight broker Ali Emmanuel, decided to give up its initial public offering at the last moment because of the severe market situation, which has had a record of losses in the past. Earlier in 2019, car companies UBER.N and Lyft Inc. did not have a clear profit schedule, drawing lessons from these two companies, and investors began to delay investing in companies with serious loss history. "This will be a dialogue between bankers, board members and senior management teams who say 'these are isolated, irreparable' or 'our emotions have changed, we need to be more conservative and use different strategies'," said David Ethridge, director of First Public Offer Services at PwC.
Jonathan van Nes, along with Nancy Pelosi, pushed a plan
Pink Soldier star Jonathan van Nes appeared Thursday in the U.S. Congressional Hills, and discussed the affirmative action bill with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California Democrats).
The affirmative action bill will provide non-discriminatory protection to individuals of sexual minorities in credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jurors services and public facilities.
The bill will amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Nes, who recently publicly admitted to being infected with HIV, first shared a video of his catwalking in the Capitol and explained in the text that he had met with House Speakers to talk about the Bill of Rights, common life with people living with HIV, and access to PrEP (an HIV-preventive drug):
He then shared a longer post, depicting the two hand-to-hand scenario, urging his followers to bravely face Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Kentucky Republican) and pressuring Republican senators to submit the affirmative action bill to the Senate:
Pelosi introduced the affirmative action bill on March 13. The House of Representatives passed legislation in May, which has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to fundamentally determine the legalization of workplace anti-gay discrimination and argued at a meeting of Friends of the Tribunal that federal law on employer discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights Act did not intend to protect individuals from being fired for their sexual orientation.
Earlier this year, Pelosi co-starred with Van Nes and three other Soldiers as well as Rep. Alexander Ocasio Cortes (New York Democrats), discussed the policy and promoted the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared a photo of her and Van Nes warmly shaking hands on the balcony, thanking him for his voice in this fight:
David Edenburg is making a new documentary about animals and colours
David Edenburg was 93 years old this year, but the iconic natural master is still unfashionable.
After he launched the groundbreaking Nephi documentary "Our Planet", the popular star character will return with another series: The Colors of Life.
This time, the father of two children will study how animals use color in their lives through high-tech cameras dedicated to the show.
The BBC revealed that the star's purpose was to show "the invisible colored world of the naked eye," which does sound very appealing.
Although fans are looking forward to releasing this series in the near future, it seems that we all need to wait patiently because it will not appear on our screen until 2021.
But we are sure it's worth waiting for.
At a prestigious ceremony in London earlier this month, David was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Television Select Magazine.
To date, the national treasurer's career has been 60 years old, bringing joyful laughter to millions of people.
When collecting his medals, the reporter enthusiastically said: "Yes. What I do is not always so interesting and sometimes people will hear things they don't like!
But it's an honor and a great joy."
"Sir David Edenburg is still working, studying and making shows, not only as a British hero but also as a global idolater."
This week, David was once again praised by a polar explorer named after him.
The star character, along with Prince William and Princess Kate, attended the naming ceremony at Merseyside's Berkenhead Cammerleard shipyard.
"The world is facing all sorts of tricky problems, which are not news for any one of you, and the most aware of this is today's young people who will inherit the world."
Intractable issues require extensive research and fact-finding to be addressed.
This is what this amazing cruise ship will do to find out the facts and seek scientific methods in order to deal with the problems facing today's world, and more and more people will do so in the future."
Colors of Life are expected to air on BBC 2nd in 2021, while NEIFT will retain global copyright.
The husband of the murdered lawmaker Joe Cox said, "Don't use my wife's name to get a political score."
Jeremy Corbyn criticized Boris Johnson by posting a video of the murdered lawmaker last night, after which Joe Cox's husband said his wife's name could not be used to get political scores.
The Labour Party leader's video clipped footage of Mrs. Cox and her night-night prayer activities after her death, with a subtitle: "Boris Johnson doesn't care about our street violence."
Critics said Corbyn was using Joe Cox's homicide to get "cheap political scores," while Joe Cox's husband, Brendan Cox, said Labour leaders attributed hate speech to "a simple political party problem" as "wrong."
Mr. Cox said: "Jeremy is right, and the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hatred and division."
"But it's wrong for Jeremy to categorize hate speech as a simple political party issue. While Joe is a passionate Labourer, there are things that must go beyond partisan politics."
Cox also shared a post saying that Joe Cox's name was "not just a political score point," and added the subtitle "this one." Thank you. Corbyn's video begins with his talk of Mrs. Cox being murdered by a far-right activist in West Yorkshire three years ago, where people reacted strongly.
Turning to clips about Mrs. Cox, Johnson and female lawmakers, Corbyn said: "The prime minister knows these words will fuel violence with serious consequences."
He continued to criticize Johnson and called for the establishment of a Labour government.
"Many are deeply concerned about Boris Johnson's remarks, which are being relayed by far-right elements. When women lawmakers facing death threats asked him this question, Johnson disdained them.
At the same time, Conservative MP and Commerce Secretary Najint Zahabi said: "It's a big mistake to use Joe Cox in this way because her family has explicitly asked not to do so.
"If you have a little respect, Jeremy Corbyn, you'll retract this video." Before that, the British Parliament had debated some of the remarks this week, in which Johnson said that the "best way" to pay tribute to Mrs. Cox was "to complete Brexit". Joe's sister, King Liddbit, called for less extreme rhetoric, calling it "unfavorable for Joe's children."
Joe's sister spoke to British Independent Television: I speak publicly about some of Boris Johnson's discrediting things - I just think that this way is not conducive to progress. I can say what I think is right and what is wrong, but I will try to do it in a prudent manner."
Labour MP Ivite Cooper's daughter said publicly yesterday that she has been worried about her mother's personal safety given the way people talk about politicians.
House blames Trump on border wall issues, but he plans to use a veto.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is trying to overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency power to attack military bases projects (such as schools and targets) in order to pay for his long-standing commitment to the construction of a border wall.
The bill was presented to Trump with a result of 236 votes in favor and 174 against him, but he would certainly reject it like he rejected a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the bill last week, but more than a dozen senior Republican lawmakers denounced Trump.
The vote on Friday was different, as the government recently published a list of 127 military construction projects totaling $3.6 billion that would be canceled to cover the cost of building border walls, including many of the Republican constituencies and states.
Brazil says its northeast beach oil spills are not domestic
On Thursday, the Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency - Brazil's Bureau of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources said that analysis of large-scale oil spills on its northeastern beaches showed that the leaked crude was not domestically produced.
In a statement, the agency said they had launched an oil spill investigation on several beaches in northeastern states since September 2. The local media published photographs of turtles covered with black coking oil produced by floating oil.
The oil sludge spread along the north-eastern coast of Brazil with a total length of more than 1,500 kilometres (932 mi) affecting local wildlife and polluting picturesque beaches in many popular tourist destinations across the country, including Fortno Beach in Sealah and Malagoy Beach in Aragos.
Brazil's state-owned holding oil company - Brazilian National Oil Company said in a statement that after molecular analysis of crude oil, it proved that the leaked crude was not produced or sold by the company.
It is usually checked before export of crude oil to ensure that it meets the requirements of refiners receiving this crude. Crude oil produced in different fields can be identified according to a range of chemical components, including sulfur content, nitrogen content, acidity and viscosity.
Brazilian oil regulator - Brazil's National Oil Regulatory Authority Director Desio Odone noted that the agency believes it could be a tanker away from the coast of Brazil leaked oil, but added that this possibility has not been confirmed.
Some sea turtles were contaminated with oil, and after being rescued in North Rio Grande County they were sent to rehabilitation centers. The bodies of some other animals were also found, the Brazilian Bureau for Environment and Renewable Natural Resources said, but did not specify the number of movements or deaths.
Brazil's National Oil Company said in a statement that the company, although not related to oil spills, is also involved in clean-up and about 100 employees are helping clear the beach.
Skoda provides voice digital assistants for drivers
In a Wednesday announcement, the Czech automaker said drivers could use the phrase "good, Laura" to start digital assistants.
The system will initially be configured in the Kamiq city SUV and compact car Scala. According to SKODA's annual report, since its acquisition by Volkswagen Group in 1991, the SKODA brand delivered 1.25 million vehicles worldwide in 2018.
The company's introduction of virtual voice assistants also reflects the efforts made by other manufacturers in the automotive industry. For example, some BMW cars are now equipped with "intelligent personal assistants" that can be activated using buttons, call words or phrases like "hello, BMW." Drivers can use voice commands to start seat heating functions, get tyre pressure information and adjust internal temperature.
On Thursday, Jack Palmer, a senior connected car expert at SBD Automotive, sent a statement to the CNBC channel via email that he said: "Voice is an ideal interactive tool for cars."
"If most commands from drivers can be received through virtual assistants without flipping touchscreens and buttons, then the current prevailing driver distraction problem will be greatly alleviated," Palmer added. "Automakers have realized this because they are vying to integrate or collaborate with their respective solutions with consumer electronics companies such as Google, Amazon and others."
The actions of companies such as Skoda and BMW show that the way people interact with cars may change. Market Intelligence Inc.'s automotive analyst Hannah Caseyen told CNBC via email, a recent report by the company focused on why nearly 40% of U.S. consumers who own cars "hope to use personal digital assistants in cars."
Ghana: Focus on World Rabies Day
On Wednesday, Accra held an event to celebrate the thirteenth World Day of Rabies and actively called on pet owners to vaccinate their own pets in order to protect citizens' lives and safety.
The theme of the event is "Vaccination: Ending Rabies", organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in cooperation with the Agricultural Veterinary Service.
The aim of the event was to emphasize the important role of mass vaccinations for dog vaccines in eliminating rabies in Ghana.
In his address to the meeting, Mr. Abbe Haier-Gabriel, Assistant Director-General and Representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Ghana, noted that rabies could be minimized if vaccinations were vigorously strengthened so as to keep roaming animals away from humans, especially children.
He said that under the Global Strategic Plan for Zero Deaths to Rabies by 2030, "500,000 people die every year from rabies, of which 40% are children living in Asia and Africa," he called for comprehensive measures to address this situation and protect children from rabies.
Mr. Haier-Gabriel said that most roaming animals are infected with rabies, which once again reflects the need for Ghana to further expand its "joint fight against rabies" strategy (i.e. zero death from rabies by 2030), which requires pet owners to vaccinate animals with human and animal diseases.
He stressed that Ghana must embark on a five-year campaign and vaccination programme to raise public awareness and eliminate the risk of human rabies.
He noted that through the Ghanaian Action Plan for Rabies and Prevention (2018-2030), we have developed a comprehensive road map to gradually eliminate rabies, hoping to eradicate this long underserved tropical epidemic by 2030.
Mr. Hel Gabriel pledged that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was prepared to work with other relevant units to prevent and control rabies in Ghana.
Dr. Owen Kalua, WHO representative in Ghana, noted that rabies is a popular disease and must be controlled to save lives.
He explained that through the "zero death toll of human rabies by 2030" strategy, countries were supported in developing and implementing national plans to eliminate rabies, including the concept of health integration and cross-sectoral cooperation.
Dr. Kalua noted that rabies and other animal diseases are transmitted to humans through dogs, adding that a "healthy one" approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating human rabies is very appropriate.
Dr. Asiedu Baa, head of veterinary services, regretted that rabies had become a global burden.
"Although rabies cannot be cured, infection can be prevented by vaccination, so it is feasible to eliminate rabies and all animal owners must ensure that their animals are vaccinated."
Dr. Ba'a said that while using appropriate sustainable control strategies can completely prevent rabies, the mortality rate of rabies will continue to rise due to a lack of funds and insufficient synergies, and the epidemic will intensify.
He added: "It is imperative that the animal sector have sufficient resources to prevent rabies from spreading on dogs in order to prevent this disease."
12-year-old girl "Let the world be silent"
Just 16 years old, Greta Tomberry has established her position as a global voice on climate change. But 27 years ago, just before social media was popular, another girl had already blamed the leaders of the United Nations on the world stage.
Her environmental movement has been unstoppable since Greta Tombery organized student strikes in her country's Sweden to protest climate change; and on Monday, her outrageous and passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit brought her environmental movement to its pinnacle; she lashed out against politicians stealing her "dream" and "childhood" with "empty talk," while humanity is witnessing a "massive extinction catastrophe."
The uncomfortable criticism of Tombery was both fierce and highly acclaimed. New York magazine called her "the virginity of a protest against the climate change community," while the Guardian compared her remarks with the meaning of President Lincoln's Gdittsburgh Address.
In 1992, the media also criticized Suzuki Sowen. Long before Tombury's cold-faced complaint against state officials that "we may not have a future," netizens split into two completely opposed factions - the opposition and support of Suzuki Sowen; at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Susan Moven, 12, made similar calls to her as "a girl who silenced the world for five minutes."
"We're here... just to tell you adults that you have to change your lifestyle," she began her own speech, as Tombery told the attendant adults 'we won't let you easily hide those responsibilities.'
As Tombberry told the UN Climate Summit that "a huge extinction catastrophe is coming, and you know all day only fairy tales about money and economic growth," Suzuki said to leaders of nations: "Losing my future is far less simple than losing elections or fluctuating stock markets."
"I'm afraid to get under the sun now, because the ozone layer is empty. I'm afraid to breathe air because I don't know what chemicals are inside," Suzuki said in a speech in 1992. Looking back at 2019, students were barracked with slogans: "You die from old age and I am dying from climate change."
The environmental problems cited by Suzuki Thorwin were reflected in the world of the early 1990s, when ecological issues focused on deforestation, ozone depletion and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, humans successfully solved them.
Suzuki Sewen himself later created an environmental think tank and worked for the Special Advisory Group of Secretary-General Kofi Annan at the beginning of the 21st century.
On the one hand, none of her most worrying things happened. On the other hand, governments are still struggling with environmental issues while receiving child censures.
Assuming that 27 years later our world still exists (the world will be extinct unless humans cut carbon emissions to zero in the next decade or so), this radical environmental girl is likely to recall her long career at the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, which began with this famous speech.
By then, another worrying child may be issuing a blatant warning of the problem of acid rain in the Martian colony.
Scotland's Nationalist Party may support Jeremy Corbyn as interim prime minister in order to stop a no-deal Brexit
The Scottish National Party has said it may support Jeremy Corbyn as the interim prime minister of the British Prime Minister's office in order to block a non-agreeable Brexit.
As relations between parliamentarians and the prime minister's office become increasingly strained, Nicola Stkin suggested that a Labour leader could be supported before the election as acting Prime Minister.
Mr. Corbyn called on Conservative traitors and opposition legislators to support him in his leadership of the interim government in August, but the move was resisted, particularly from Liberal Democratic leader Joe Swimson.
According to these proposals, the opposition tried to oust Boris Johnson through a "no-confidence vote" and then formed a coalition government seeking extensions in order to stop Britain from leaving the EU on October 31.
The plan failed to gain cross-party support at the time, but senior Scottish Nationalists feared that if no agreement was reached before October 19, Mr. Johnson would ignore the law and force him to delay Brexit.
Scotland's Nationalist leader Nicola Sturgeon suggested that the extension could be ensured by appointing Corbyn, as keeping Johnson in charge of manipulation was a "bad idea."
In response to a tweet that suggested appointing a Labour leader or another interim prime minister, she said: "Agree with this practice.
The only purpose of the untrusted vote, when the opposition unites with someone at its center, is to ensure a postponement and then immediately hold an election.
Everything is risky, but forcing Johnson to do nothing or even make a bad deal seems to me the answer."
Senior MPs Harriet Hamman and Ken Clark have been nominated as potential candidates to lead the coalition government, but senior Scottish Nationalist sources insist that they must be Labour leaders.
"We will have to elect a new prime minister through a 'no-confidence vote' so that we can ask for a postponement of Brexit and an election," the source said.
To try to find a compromised, nationally united candidate is too complicated, especially now that we have candidates. Whether people like it or not, Corbyn must be the interim prime minister."
A spokesman for the Scottish National Party said it was committed to preventing a non-agreeable Brexit and "removing dangerous and undemocratic current prime minister as soon as possible."
The spokesman said: "If there is political will, it is now possible for political parties to unite in order to ensure that the letters guaranteeing extensions do not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his associates who have determined to find a solution to avoid the Bann Act, but are issued by the interim acting prime minister, who will serve only within the necessary timeframe before an election takes place immediately.
"We remain open to all options in order to achieve the goal of blocking a non-agreeable Brexit and ousting Boris Johnson."
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this will be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbyn: there are 288 Conservative MPs and 10 Democratic Unificationists, so the opposition needs to pull some out of 34 independent MPs.
The Labour Party sees the plan as "the simplest and most democratic way to stop a non-agreeable Brexit."
However, the Liberal Democratic Party believes that the interim government under Mr. Corbyn's leadership needs to be supported by former Conservative congressmen and their own traitors so it cannot get the necessary support in the House of Representatives.
Angus Conservative Congressman Kostner Heyer said: "This report confirms a long-standing suspicion that Scottish Nationalists will be very happy to support Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom."
Undoubtedly, Corbyn's unsteady stance on the second independence referendum (indyref2) is a determinant for nationalists.
If he succeeds as prime minister, he has opened the door to a reconvening 2014 referendum.
Only the Conservative government will stand up to support those who voted "against" in an event that should have been a hundred-year encounter."
More than 50 students from the University of Surrey were barred from participating in sports teams
"People are just expecting the lads to do what should be done for a holiday. You can accept this is an over-drinking, noisy trip."
However, according to the students' response, some of the students' behavior this year was very overheated, especially during a game where members of the football club were provoked by their teammates to provoke women while their friends tried to "block" them from doing so.
Alan Sutherland, president of the Sarri Students' Association, said: "We have realized that this behavior is improper and that any student accused of'serious' misconduct will be transferred to a school investigation in accordance with the Student Disciplinary Regulations."
The school has formally punished three students and personally investigated the behavior of the football team.
One student was delisted by the school for three misconduct or harassment and one assault.
At the same time, two other students also accused of harassing were given a final warning and asked for an apology.
One of the students was barred from attending college campuses at a specific time, and another student was barred from participating in organized social activities.
The University of Surrey men's football club said they had "sincerely apologized" for their members' actions on a trip to Croatia.
Matt de Grodder should not be punished for stigma of schizophrenia
Matthew de Grodt, who killed five people at a family gathering in Calgary in 2016, was found to be unaccountable for his actions.
Now, in 2019, one hearing will decide whether to allow him more freedom, such as unsupervised exit. The decision will be made in the next few weeks, so during this period we should consider whether it is a good idea.
He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not to be criminally responsible but has been watching psychiatrists and taking drugs since then. His psychiatrist Santok Rey said before the Review Committee that "if Matthew de Grodden commits another crime, it will have serious consequences."
But other diseases, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized.
In fact, most people with schizophrenia are non-violent and more likely to be victims of crime or violence than perpetrators.
He argues that, unless absolutely necessary, he or other psychopaths remain in detention is a form of isolation. This will make psychiatric patients, especially those with schizophrenia, never able to integrate into society; thus they will continue to be stigmatized and the concept of them as dangerous criminals will perpetuate.
Hungary's Prime Minister Orban defended his candidate for the European Commission, saying "there is a solution at hand"
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he had a number of solutions "at hand" after Hungary's candidate nomination for the European Commission was rejected.
According to Reuters, Rovana Prombo, a Romanian socialist politician appointed by the European Minister of Transport, and former Hungarian Justice Minister Raslo Trozani, an EU enlargement nominating commissioner, were told that their nomination hearings could not be held due to inconsistent content in the financial statements.
"I firmly believe that Trozani is the most suitable candidate for a member of the European Commission," Orban said. "Not to say he's guilty, it's helping the government and me... protect Hungary from immigration."
The move is very embarrassing to recommend Trosani's Orban, who has also been in conflict with Brussels on issues such as immigration policy.
Meets with Baby in Flight: Japanese Air Launches Help to Avoid Screaming Baby Location
Japanese Airways has introduced an online booking tool that can show the seat of school pedagogues, and from then on long-distance flights disturbed by crying babies may cease to exist.
When selecting seats with children from eight days to two years old, a child logo automatically appears on the slate and alerts other passengers who have not yet been selected.
Japan Airlines has quickly pointed out that the new features do not guarantee passengers can completely avoid crying baby noises.
If passengers book flights through third parties, or take part in a travel group, or change the plane at the last moment, the icon may not appear, Japan Airways said on its website.
Japan Airlines and other airlines have not yet figured out ways to predict the seat of continuous snorers and passengers who completely tilt their seats while eating on board.
Despite this, the move has won praise from some users on social media.
"Thank you @JAL_Official_jp for reminding me of where the kids are planning to yell during their 13-hour journey," businessman Rahat Ahmed wrote on Twitter.
However, there are also some who urge travellers to remain tolerant.
"They are babies, and we used to be. We're going to learn how to tolerate otherwise it will soon need a map of what is common in life such as greetings, rinsing, shitting, drunkenness," one user wrote.
Pompeo accuses Syria of using chemical weapons in May attack
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a speech during the United Nations conference, which the UN General Assembly said Thursday it had determined that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
Pompeo said U.S. officials have determined that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad government used chlorine gas in a May 19 attack on opposition fighters in Idlib province.
Pompeo said in a press release: "The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity."
U.S. officials said in May that the reports they received corresponded to chemical attacks in northwestern Syria, but did not give a definitive conclusion at the time.
In April 2018, the United States, Britain and France launched airstrikes against Syria in retaliation for what they said was a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier this month.
"This is different in a sense because it's chlorine... but to know that President Trump actively protects the world from chemical weapons attacks," Pompeo said.
He also said the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to fund investigations into other suspected use of chemical weapons incidents in Syria.
Pompeo also called on Assad's government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including the missing U.S. journalist Austin Tess, who was presumed to have been in custody for seven years.
"He's just one of some U.S. citizens in Syria, and we call on the Syrian regime to release them all."
Tesla released a report that Musk aims to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter
Tesla Motors co-founder and CEO Elon Musk
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said it was expected to deliver 100,000 vehicles this quarter, which would be a new record after the news reported that Tesla shares rose more than 5 percent.
The Electrek website said the news was leaked from an email that Musk sent to Tesla employees, in which Musk wrote: "We are expected to deliver 100,000 vehicles for the first time this quarter and it's an exciting milestone for our company!"
The CEO added: "The difficulty with this goal is to ensure that we are equipped with the right models in the right place and maximise our company's resources to help achieve delivery goals at the end of the quarter."
The automaker is expected to report on its quarterly car deliveries in the coming days.
Tesla delivered about 95,000 electric vehicles last quarter.
Greece: 5 people deny trafficking in newborns of poor women by illegal adoption
Five Greek and Georgian citizens appear in court on suspicion of involvement in a criminal organization, which allegedly trafficked newborns as an adoptive form.
On Friday, both of the five denied this charge before the local judge in Thessalonian. Two Georgian nationals were accused of being the main offenders.
The gang allegedly recruited several Bulgarian extremely poor pregnant women who were willing to give up newborns that would be given birth, and authorities said the group had sold babies to many Greek couples without children.
A total of 12 people were arrested this week for alleged illegal adoption and trafficking in human eggs, while another 54 were accused of complicity.
Police said it was one of the largest and most organized gangs in Europe, which Interpol assisted in investigating the case.
Mike Pompeo said the Syrian government used chlorine chemical weapons in a May attack.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that the United States has concluded that the Syrian government used chlorine chemical weapons during its May battle with rebels in Idlib.
Pompeo said in a press conference at the United Nations General Assembly in New York: "The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to war crimes and crimes against humanity."
Pompeo added: "Today I announce that the United States has concluded that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on May 19."
The U.S. said it received massive reports in May that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army suspected some chemical substances had appeared in areas of fighting with anti-government armed forces in the northwest; however, there was no clear conclusion about whether Syria's Assad government had used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump administration bombed Syria twice on suspicion of using chemical weapons by Assad's Syrian government forces.
My father still hopes that the suspect who shot his son a year ago will end up in the net for one day.
The 20-year-old in Long Beach has been shot dead for a year, but the victim's family hasn't given up on the murderer's hope.
Guy Alford, the victim's father, said: "I hope I can change with you, son, I want to change with you."
Alford returned to the scene of the crime a year after his son Guy Alford III was shot dead - Jack's fast food chain in boxes near 52nd Street and Atlantic Avenue. He said he wanted to draw attention to the unsolved murder of his son.
He said, "Some people know something and they need to say it."
The second car was parked behind him after Alford stopped in his car restaurant. Three suspects were then dropped from the car. One of them went to the driver's seat at Alford, firing at Alford. Four people on the Alford car jumped out and ran away. Then the suspect returned to his car and drove away.
Orford said, "Wherever this bastard is, he will be caught."
The sad father said he didn't know who would want to hurt his son or who was in the car when his son was shot.
Orford said: "They ran out of my son's car like in the video, where did you go back to try to help him or do something?"
Alford said his son was a star footballer at Almanny High School and then an outstanding security guard for the Long Beach City College rugby team. Alford said that when his son tried to play, he struggled to reach Level 1 school, dreaming of becoming a nurse.
Michael Harvey, a friend of his son, said: "He has done three jobs. I am 21 years old and he is one year younger than me; whoever maintains this busy state and working philosophy will be admired by others."
Police are still investigating the deadly shooting, and Alford said he himself did not give up.
He said, "This issue will be resolved and I can assure you."
Alford personally offered a $2,000 bounty to look for clues that could arrest and criminalize suspects. We strongly recommend that all those who provide information about the crime call the Long Beach Police Department.
Brexit is difficult
If Johnson tries to evade his promise of an extension, he'll be humiliated in EU courts waiting for him in Brussels. This calms the mood of European officials who are likely to agree to do so. Mainly because spending more time finding solutions can reduce the threat of a "unagreeable Brexit," which will hurt both economies.
However, European diplomats also saw that the political stalemate in Britain led to a delay in British decision-making. Parliamentarians were able to put aside their differences, limit Johnson's actions and seek an extension, but they could only end up with all the consensus they could reach.
Even with elections, the prospects remain worrisome, as European countries want a friendly solution to the chaos brought about by Brexit. The opposition Labour Party's policy of Brexit is painfully distorted and almost incomprehensible; while the centrist Liberal Democrats have suggested that Brexit be lifted, this argument is also considered too extreme.
If a viable outline of the agreement is placed at the desk of the European Commission's headquarters in Bellammon Tower, Brussels may be more optimistic.
Johnson often lashed out on his predecessor's "reserve" plan to avoid returning Ireland to the hard border and protect the EU single market, but he did not bring any convincing alternative. Officials said that many of the alternatives proposed by the UK were not specific enough and lacked operationality, which was difficult to implement in a timely manner before Britain left the EU on October 31.
In addition, Johnson's weakness will make the leaders of the 27 EU countries confronting him more unwilling to eliminate the focus "red line", even though British minister Michael Goff, who is responsible for a "no-deal Brexit," claims that they are "realigning" their reserve program.
Europe has no choice but to negotiate with the current British government while trying to maintain unity among the remaining 27 member states, so Europe should still try to make the biggest concessions for Britain, but the more time dragged on, the harder it can be achieved. If there is also a chance to reach an agreement with the British Parliament again, the EU should take advantage of this opportunity.
But it's more like a football game with 27 players in line defending, while the other tries to pick up the ball home.
The EU is good at setting rules, demarcating the "red line" and insisting on its implementation, but unilaterally applying its will is short. At least before the British general election or the second referendum broke the stalemate, the UK has failed to consider its internal contradictions.
Brexit is difficult.
For the first time, a black hole swallows and ripples stars.
The first captures a picture of a huge black hole engulfing and tearing the stars.
The researchers wrote in Astrophysical Journal that the star is nearly as big as our sun, 375 million light-years away and can see it twisting and spiraling under a supermassive black hole's gravitational pull.
The star was then swallowed, and astronomers called this rare cosmic event a tidal torn event.
NASA's planetary search telescope, the transient exoplanet probe satellite - captured for the first time a detailed timeline from beginning to end of the event.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect this phenomenon before observing the Transatlantic Exoplanet Probe satellite, capturing the beginning of the violence in the continuous observation area of transatlantic exoplanet probing satellites designed to find distant planets.
Thomas Hollian, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institute of Science who led the study, said: "This is actually a combination of rationality and good luck, sometimes what's needed to push science forward."
When the star ventures too close to a supermassive black hole, it will be sucked in, which lies at the center of most galaxies, such as Earth's Milky Way.
The powerful gravity of the black hole ripped off the star, some of the stars were thrown into space, and the rest were inhaled into the black hole to form a glowing bright gas during swallowing.
He added: "Specifically, we can measure the speed at which this star brightens and we also observe a rare planet's temperature decline and brightness dimming."
British Commerce Commission to investigate Thomas Cook's bankruptcy
The British Civil Aviation Authority said it planned to operate 72 flights following the collapse of Thomas Cook's tourism group, bringing another 16,000 passengers back to the UK.
Air regulators said more than 40 percent of passengers had been retaken in the largest peacetime repatriation operation launched on Monday.
At the same time, the British Parliamentary Commerce Committee has launched an insolvency investigation into Thomas Cook and sought to inquire about management issues regarding executive compensation and accounting policies.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel agency, crashed this Monday morning and affected hotel owners, tourist attractions and resorts all over the world.
"The UK's old-fashioned tourism company unfortunately collapsed, and the main executives of which should face public scrutiny and be held accountable for their actions prior to the collapse of the company," said Rachel Reeves, Chairman of the British Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.
The hearings will begin in mid- and late October.
"Both directors are delighted to accept this opportunity to clarify the facts and demonstrate that their actions have always been in the best interests of Thomas Cook's customers, employees and stakeholders," a company source told Reuters.
Why the Times publishes detailed identity information for whistleblowers
Thursday, The Times released exclusive details of a whistleblower's allegations that led the Democratic Party to launch an impeachment investigation against President Trump this week. (This article says the whistleblower is a CIA official who had previously served in the White House and was very professional on Ukraine).
Many readers, including national security and intelligence workers, criticised the Times' disclosure of details, saying the move could put the life of the whistleblower at risk and might stall those who wanted to report.
We expressed the concerns of these readers to Dean Barquett, editor-in-chief of The Times, who responded in a discussion with the reader's center:
As information provided by whistleblowers triggered a landmark impeachment process, the president and some of his supporters blasted the whistleblower's credibility.
We decided to publish limited information about whistleblowers, including his work at a non-political institution and his complaints based on an in-depth understanding of the White House because we wanted to provide readers with information that would enable them to make their own judgments as to whether they were credible.
China says it has not provoked any war and has not invaded other countries' lands
On Friday, China said it had no intention of provoking "a war or a conflict" and did not "invad the land of another country", evading reference to the Sino-Indian War of 1962.
"China has always been committed to dealing with territorial issues and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiations, consultations," China issued an official white paper four days before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party's rule on October 1.
"For 70 years, China has not proactively provoked any war and conflict or invaded an inch of land from other countries," the white paper reads.
The white paper, while emphasizing the "peaceful rise" of the Chinese Communist Party, did not mention the bloody war with India in 1962 and the vast swathes of land occupied by China, particularly Aksaychin.
China also claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of southern Tibet, which India opposes.
As of now, the two countries have held 21 rounds of special representatives talks to resolve the border dispute.
In addition to the 1962 war, India and China also clashed militarily in Doqlam in 2017 when the Chinese People's Liberation Army attempted to pave a path in an area close to what is known as "India's chicken neck" corridor linked to states in northeastern India, which Bhutan claimed to own.
Finally, the issue was resolved diplomatically and both sides withdrew their troops.
In 1979, a major military conflict broke out between China and Vietnam. China claimed sovereignty over the entire South China Sea. Viet Nam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan both objected.
"China and 12 of its 14 neighbours have completely resolved the land border issue, demarcating the maritime boundary between the northern China-Vietnam Bay," the White Paper said, noting that since reform and opening up in 1978, China has taken the initiative to cut military posts by "more than 4 million".
The Chinese army, which has 2 million military personnel, remains the world's largest.
The prolongation of the monsoon season has caused flooding and chaos in many parts of India.
The monsoon season in India has been raging for nearly a month, with unprecedented rainfall leading to the collapse of buildings and many crops starting to rot.
The monsoon in northern India usually weakened in early September, but the average rainfall this month was 37% higher than normal. Experts from the Indian Meteorological Department say it would be the latest monsoon season in decades if that lasted for a few days.
Many parts of India are still suffering from unprecedented flooding, with the most recent storm occurring in Pune town in western India, where heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday killed several people and destroyed buildings.
Houses were flooded and people rushed on the streets drowning in their knees, which was usually seen only when the monsoon peaked.
Other cities, such as Calcutta, Leknau and Heidrapa, also experienced heavy rains. The homes in northern North Akande were severely damaged due to continued rainfall.
The monsoon is too late. Many areas lack water and farmers are prepared to cope with possible drought disasters.
"It's not normal to rain so much at this time every year, causing my vegetables - the curly cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes I have harvested - to rot," said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bimtar, North Akande.
For consumers, this late monsoon leads to an increase in the price of onions, an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, onions are sold at 80 rupees per kg (about PS1), while normally it is 20 rupees per kg (23 pence).
The holidays are also at risk. The next grand festival is the Tensheng Festival on October 8, when Indians set up a huge comic portrait of Robona, which was one of the characters in the Hindu epic "Romania", with a thick beard and an evil laugh.
Burning Roponta's portrait symbolizes evil. But these portraits are made of paper, and if the monsoon persists, Loponta may laugh at the end.
Julian Assange: Private Security Company 'Monitors WikiLeaks Founders for the CIA's Embassy in Ecuador'
When Julian Assange lived in London, a Spanish private security company hired to protect Ecuador's embassy in London was spying on the founder of WikiLeaks by U.S. intelligence agencies.
According to a report by the Spanish National News Agency, private security companies in Spain are suspected of providing the CIA with audio and video from Assange's meeting with his lawyers.
The company is under investigation by the Spanish High Court.
Assange himself personally filed a criminal lawsuit, accusing the company of violating his privacy and the confidentiality of his client-lawyer privileges.
The National News Agency said that Spanish private security companies failed to respond to requests for comment on the matter.
In April, Assange was deported from the embassy after being handed over to British authorities by Ecuador.
In 2012, Assange entered the Ecuadorian embassy for asylum during bail and was at risk of being extradited to Sweden for allegations of sexual assault; Assange said he would be extradited to the United States if he gave up on WikiLeaks activities.
In June, the United States formally issued a request for extradition to Assange, who was charged with 18 counts of misuse of computers and unauthorized disclosure of defense information.
He was accused of collusion with former U.S. intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
Formerly imprisoned for violating the conditions of bail in Sweden's extradition request, Assange currently serving his sentence at Belmash prison in London, which was supposed to have been released last week, but has been remanded for trial due to waiting for a U.S. extradition hearing held in London in February 2020.
In May, Swedish prosecutors reopened investigations into Assange's rape allegations - an allegation that Assange has denied.
After the Almighty Airlines declared an emergency, the flight landed in Baltimore.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said a plane safely landed at Baltimore Washington International Airport after declaring an emergency.
The Federal Aviation Administration said in an email that Flight 328 landed at Baltimore Washington International Airport at 6:19 p.m. due to a hydraulic problem with Boeing B777.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the flight has departed Baltimore but its destination is unknown. The number of passengers on the flight is not yet clear.
Almighty International Airlines (headquartered in Tarsa, Oklahoma) received a telephone message and returned the message immediately on Thursday night.
Why do we need Gandhi?
When we celebrate the 150th anniversary of a remarkable person's birth, the leaders of the world's two democracies should listen to his principles.
Mahathir Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, devoted his life to the cause of morality, non-violence, tolerance and social justice, left a valuable legacy for the world.
The U.S. activists, Howard Thaman and Benjamin Mess, traveled extensively to India to meet Gandhi, so the impact of Gandhi on the civil rights movement began long before Martin Luther King accepted his ideas.
Cayza Chavez traces his political awakening back to a news film he watched at the age of 112 about "a gunless half naked man who conquered the power of the British Empire," and later, when he led the farm workers' movement, many strategies were followed by Gandhi.
Outside the United States, Gandhi has the same influence. For a few simple examples, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yusafzai and climate change activists have seen Gandhi as an indicator lamp.
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in addition to their oral compliments about Gandhi at a successful joint public meeting recently held in Houston, seem indifferent to his thoughts. Both are right-wing populists who lack compassion or tolerance for the rule, have successfully launched whites and Hindus into voting groups in their respective countries while stoking divisions and social discord.
Modi has been a member of the Indian Nationalist Organization-National Volunteer Organisation since his 8th birthday, whose former member, Natulam Goldson, killed Gandhi on January 30, 1948. In fact, Modi's ruling party - the People's Party of India - parliamentarians in recent years have greatly appreciated the murderer of Gandhi.
Modi's government has demonstrated anti-Gandism in many ways, abolishing the status of self-government and state in Jammu and Kashmir, which is a Muslim majority province, and imposing blockades on the localities; nor does it welcome refugees fleeing from Myanmar's extreme persecution.
Moreover, the Modi government has also created social turmoil by establishing a national register of citizens and setting up detention camps in Assam State, which is located at the border area, apparently to capture non-national citizens from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh, but this move could lead to nearly two million people being deprived of their right to vote and imprisoned.
The travel ban imposed by the Trump administration on Muslim-majority countries is a response to Islamophobia, and this is often considered in Modi's policymaking. Its revulsion towards refugees is also an illustration of the suffering suffered by the Indian government against Rohingya, while U.S. detention camps are similar to those established by Modi's regime.
At the recent joint meeting between the two leaders, a moment of worthwhile learning emerged. During the event, House Majority Leader Stony Hoyer cited Gandhi's definition of democracy as "a democracy that gives weak and strong equal opportunities."
On the 150th anniversary of Gandhi's birth, if Trump and Modi can remember Gandhi's advice, their performance in terms of tenure should be much better.
White House statement: Trump nominates Peter Gaine as Director of the Federal Emergency Management
On April 3, 2019, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Acting Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Department Peter Gaine smiled at a hearing held by the Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee about the Agency's budget requests for fiscal year 2020.
U.S. President Donald Trump nominates Peter Gaine as Director of Federal Emergency Management, the White House said in a statement.
The current Deputy Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Gynec, has served as acting administrator of the agency, which oversees government response to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Since the resignation of Brock Lang in March, the agency has not yet been approved by the Senate. The administration's top department - Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - found Lang illegal to use buses for both Washington and his residence in North Carolina, after which Lang resigned as Administrator.
Earlier this month, another Administrator candidate Jeffrey Bayad's nomination was withdrawn as background checks found him suspected of involvement in a bar brawl.
Gaine's nomination was unexpected. He would also need a majority of the Senate to approve the nomination in order to take up the post of Administrator.
The White House said that prior to his position as Deputy Administrator of Management in 2018, Gaines worked at the Emergency Management Department on Rhode Island and served in the U.S. Navy.
The man's "attack" was ignited at his door.
A man was ignited at his door, which police deemed a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man set fire after being moistened by a flammable liquid outside his home in Skelmersdale, Western Lancastershire, allegedly gasoline.
The man was severely burned and is currently in hospital with critical but stable conditions.
At about 1:00 a.m. on Thursday, the police received an alarm call to catch up with the man's home and initiate an attempted murder investigation.
Polin Stobbles, the investigator responsible for the investigation, said: "The incident was of a very bad nature and the man was still in hospital.
"We are conducting a series of investigations to try to find the responsible.
"We are trying to substantiate the motivations of the incident and we are convinced that it is targeted, and I want to emphasize that I don't think this event will present a threat to a wider community."
"I want people who know where the murderers are going to be able to report to us."
"Does your loved one behave suspiciously when he comes home and has smoke, gasoline or unexplainable scars?"
"We need someone to be responsible for this horrific incident."
Vulnerable Democrats sparked Pelosi's fear of impeachment
During the meeting, several members expressed their position that Democrats should continue to focus their investigation on Ukraine - accusing Trump of asking the President of Ukraine to investigate potential political adversaries in 2020 - rather than other potentially illegal cases detailed by Special Adviser Robert Mueller in his report.
Pelosi said in a news conference on Thursday morning that the vast majority of Democrats agreed to the strategy, which is that "the whistleblower's complaint" is "now focused."
The leaders hope to maintain unity within the party by continuing to focus on impeachment investigations, while looking at moderate members who have just joined the proceedings recently. MPs said that Ukraine's issues are also more clear and easy to explain to the public.
Rep. Angie Craig from Minnesota just joined the Democratic Party shortly before, she said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment inquiry as Pelosi and Democrats' leaders largely listened to MPs at previous meetings.
"Standing in my position, I've always been unwilling to push the investigation only from the point of view that I want to be bound, I want to look at due process and hope to make sure we have all the facts - this procedure will allow us to do it," she added, supporting a small-scale investigation led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Democrat Rep. Matt Carter Wright from Pennsylvania told CNN that he would not vote for the impeachment clause right now.
"We must assume that people are innocent, right? If it's all true, we have to see if the press is reporting what news and whether documents disclose this information."
Democrats will soon hear from voters about their impeachment process, and members plan to return to their respective constituencies for two weeks in early October. This is the first time a large group of members from the conservative region has heard feedback from their constituents personally since they called for an impeachment procedure after charges against Ukraine were lodged earlier this week, sometimes with negative news.
But Rep. Dan Kildi of the Michigan Democratic Party said it would be good to opt for a break at this time.
He told reporters: "I don't really think of anything better than reporting to bosses before pushing the impeachment process."
While parliamentarians have returned, the process may be faster.
Jamie Raskin, a member of the Judiciary Committee who is a proponent of the impeachment investigation, said: "I think everyone wants to complete this work in 2019."
"We need a set of provisions to ensure that legal cases are convincing and tell the public a coherent story."
Anthony Brindisi from New York, a new Democrat who refused to call for an impeachment inquiry, told CNN that he was temporarily opposed to impeaching Trump.
"While I find many of the statements in the whistleblower's report disturbing, there is more information."
According to CNN, more than half of U.S. House members have expressed support for the impeachment inquiry. However, this includes many Democrats who, while expressing support for the impeachment investigation, are still waiting for results before deciding whether to eventually vote in favor of impeaching Trump.
Trump discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky on July 25, after which about three days the number of people who supported the impeachment investigation (more than 75 House members) increased significantly.
Trump staff said lawyers have handed over Ukrainian call records to security systems
A senior Trump administration official admitted on Friday that White House lawyers had instructed to transfer the phone records of President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky in July to a highly secure system.
In addition to reporting allegations in the telephone, it is unclear what other actions have been taken to transfer records.
The Trump administration unclassified the whistleblower's complaint and released it to the public on Thursday by the House Intelligence Committee, complaining that White House officials said they were "instructed" by White House lawyers to remove call records from a computer system that normally holds phones.
The whistleblower claimed that the transcripts were typically kept in a system of secrecy at different levels. According to White House officials, it was "not the first time" to place presidential transcripts in order to protect political sensitive information rather than national security sensitive information.
"In a few days after the call, I learned from several U.S. officials that senior White House officials have intervened to 'lock' all records of the phone, in particular formal verbatim records of calls routinely made by the White House Intelligence Unit," the whistleblower said.
The White House released a non-confidential version of the call record on Wednesday. The memo is "not verbatim records," but "records and memories" from relevant people about the call, showing Trump seeking help in investigating the Biden family.
"Another thing is that Biden's son has a lot of rumors, and Biden also terminates an indictment, and many people want to find out about it, if you can do something with the attorney general, this would be best."
During his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to fire its supreme prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the corruption of Ukrainian gas company Brisma Holdings, whose youngest son Hunter served as a director. Biden's allies insisted that he intervened because of corruption.
But the whistleblower's complaint claims that Trump was seeking foreign aid during his 2020 campaign. However, the whistleblower admitted in the complaint that these complaints were based on secondhand information.
White House lawyers have asked for changes in the record to be labelled as "covering facts" by senior Democratic officials.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California-based Democrat, announced this week an official impeachment inquiry into the president's developments in Ukraine, calling the move "covery" and saying it would be part of the impeachment investigation.
Meanwhile, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulo has understated the importance of keeping records in detail.
"Does the White House not protect conversations with the President of Ukraine?
Ukrainian Scandal: Pelosi Says Bale Was Innocent; Former U.S. Officials Support Investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused U.S. Attorney General William Barr of protecting the president on Friday in a controversial phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian leaders, which also sparked an impeachment investigation.
Before the California Democrat made the above remarks, an unnamed intelligence official presented the indictment to U.S. intelligence agency Inspector General Michael Atkinson on Thursday, which he handed over to National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire.
On the July 25 phone call, Barr and Trump's lawyer Rudolf Giuliani were repeatedly mentioned. The indictment said White House officials were very concerned about this and they tried to "lock" the records of calls.
Pelosi told the Microsoft National Broadcasting Corporation on Friday: "Barr has become very reckless." I think what they're doing is to cover up the truth.
After Trump acknowledged halting military assistance to Ukraine, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry this week. The aid was eventually approved, but House Democrats wanted to know if it had anything to do with Mr. Trump's request that Zelensky investigate Hunt Biden who had worked for Ukrainian gas companies for five years.
Also on Friday, nearly 300 former U.S. foreign policy and homeland security officials signed a letter in support of an impeachment inquiry, the coalition said Trump's actions constituted "a serious concern for national security."
"President Trump appears to have taken advantage of the power and resources of this country's highest office, inviting more foreign forces to interfere in our democratic process.
"It will also represent an effort to subordinate the national interests of the United States - and the interests of our closest allies and partners - to the personal political interests of the president."
Trump denied any inappropriateness to the call. On Friday, he denounced the complainant and again said that his calls with Zelensky were "perfect conversations."
"Furthermore, all secondhand information has been proved to be inaccurate and there may not be any other person, leaker or spy at all providing this information to him or her," he said on Twitter.
The whistleblower's complaint indicates that Vice President Pence also interacted with Ukrainian leaders, who met Zelensky earlier this month in Poland. He said there was no discussion of Joe Biden or Hunter Biden.
China's human rights defenders buried in detention centers called for thorough investigation of the truth about torture
A Chinese human rights defender was arrested and killed after his handicap demanded that Chinese leader Xi Jinping step down, and several activists called for a thorough investigation into the cause of his real death.
38-year-old Wang Mei Yu filed a handicap petition at the Hunan Public Security Hall in July to ask Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to step down and implement a system of universal suffrage within China. The police subsequently accused him of "provocational provocation," an offence that was vaguely defined by many dissidents.
According to Wang Meiyu's mother and lawyer, he died on Monday. Wang Meiyu's wife Cao Chuxia received a police call claiming that his husband had died in an army hospital in Hengyang City, while the detention center of Wang Meiyu was located in Hengyang. The police officer did not explain the cause of his death on the phone.
According to the news of the Chinese human rights organization "People's Living Watch", Cao Shuxia later saw Wang Meiyu's body, and found that he had bloodmarks in his mouth, eyes, nose and nose, as well as bruising on his face.
"China's Network of Human Rights Defenders" (CHRD) said in a statement: "The Chinese government must thoroughly investigate the torture and death of human rights activists Wang Mei Yu during his detention, and hold perpetrators of torture and extrajudicial executions to account."
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao Shuxia said that the police had asked her to accept Wang Mei Yu's unexpected death, but she repelled it. A police officer at Hengyang City Police Department said he could not comment on the case. Wang Mei Yu's mother told The Guardian reporter that the authorities paid family compensation in excess of RMB 2 million (about USD 220,000).
"Failure to substantiate the truth, or criminal responsibility of the parties, is only compensation so that it can not really wash the victims' grievances and prevent torture effectively," said Francis Eve, head of research at CRD.
"In particular, the families of the victims have actually been taken hostage and are likely to be forced to stop requesting an investigation into the facts as a result of receiving compensation."
In 2017, Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel laureate who was still serving his sentence in prison (11 years), suffered from cancer and died as the authorities refused to treat him; in 2014, defender Cao smoothly tried to attend a meeting of the United Nations on the human rights situation in China.
According to CHRD, the authorities have housed Wang Mei Yu's family since they left two young children. Others involved in the case were also under pressure from the authorities. On Wednesday, Human Rights lawyer Xiyang and human rights activist Chen Yanhui were controlled by six special police officers when discussing Wang Meiyu's case in hotel rooms.
Wang Mei began defending rights in the early years due to forced demolitions; he was previously detained by police and claimed to have been tortured.
In 2018, after the handkerchief demanded Xi's resignation, he sent messages through the Internet saying that there were policemen who stormed into his home and forced him to write letters of remorse and stop such activities.
"They don't want to think about how they tortured me these years, even three days and three nights without dripping water, another electric needle tormented me for two hours, hurting my mouth with blood, I will not yield."
Pet owners who don't walk the dog will face a $2,700 fine
If the owner is unable to provide basic goods such as shelter, food and water, they will face huge on-site fines. If the owner locks the dog for 24 hours, pets must be allowed to free their movement within the next two hours or are subject to prosecution.
The area is Australia's first jurisdiction to recognize animal perceptual abilities.
"Modern animal welfare focuses on how animals respond mentally and physically to the environment in which they live," Action City Service Minister Chris Steel, who is also a proponent of the bill, said at a news conference.
Hong Kong police said the number of students arrested in protests increased
Last Friday, Hong Kong police said 1,600 people had been detained in anti-democratic protests since June, while students accounted for 29 percent, and on the weekend they urged young people to take the right approach when planning larger gatherings.
The Chief Police Officer of the Police Public Relations Section said that despite returning to class after summer breaks, 207 high school and university students were detained this month alone compared with arresting 257 people between June and August.
The number of teenagers involved in violent crime has risen, and some have already been charged in court. These include a 16-year-old recently accused of arson, who could be sentenced to life imprisonment once convicted; a 13-year-old girl accused of blaspheming the Chinese flag, as well as others who attacked police and carried dangerous weapons.
"The form is a matter of concern," he said at the news conference, "to see these young people who have broken the law in such a small age and may have criminal records." We call upon all young people to reflect on their behaviors, hoping that the education sector and parents can help our young people regulate their behavior."
Since June, young people have largely protested the Extradition Act, which the government has now agreed to withdraw. But since then, the protests have attracted more participants, and snowballs have evolved into a larger movement against the Chinese government that opposes what protesters say Beijing is quietly infringing on Hong Kong's autonomy; Hong Kong was once a British colony whose sovereignty returned to China in 1997 when the Chinese government committed itself to self-rule over Hong Kong.
Protesters have broadened their demands, including direct election of Hong Kong leaders and independent investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters.
On Friday night, thousands of people held peaceful protests in downtown squares that accused the police of abusing their power, waving anti-police slogans and shouting democratic slogans. The Hong Kong government said it would investigate complaints against the police by a police supervisory authority who critics say had no real powers or genuine investigative powers.
Police approved a large rally in central Hong Kong on Saturday to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Umbrella Movement, which during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protestors occupied main streets of Hong Kong for 79 days and demanded universal suffrage. The campaign ended with no concession from the government.
On Sunday, protesters will also organize "anti-totalitarian" gatherings in Hong Kong and many cities around the world against their condemned Chinese tyranny.
He called on protesters to stop manipulating peaceful protests, as they had previously rallied like some people throwing gasoline bombs, sparking street fires and damaging public facilities. The police used tear gas, high-pressure water guns and other measures against these protesters, leading the protesters to complain about their excessive use of force.
The Citizen Human Rights Front also plans to hold another large march on October 1, fearing that the bloody war could embarrass the ruling Communist Party of China as it is holding a grand event in Beijing celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Hong Kong government has reduced the size of its national holiday celebrations, cancelled annual fireworks shows and changed reception ceremonies indoors.
Nestle tightens coffee beans control after herbicide panic
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement on Friday that it found glyphosate residues close to the maximum limit of glyphosate residues in some green coffee beans.
The glyphosate is a key ingredient in Monsanto's herbicide farmland. In the United States, the jury has ruled that those who claim their cancer was due to exposure to glyphosate can receive huge amounts of compensation.
Nestle bought some coffee beans from the Nestle Coffee Group, one of the world's largest traders, said that glyphosate is one of the substances monitored in its purchases. Nestle has purchased a number of honeybeans from the Nestle Coffee Group.
"This is not a new process, we're just tightening control," the spokesman told CNN Business Channel.
Nestle will start with suppliers from the world's largest coffee producers, such as Indonesia and Brazil.
"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve our weed management practices, including proper use of herbicides and other methods of herbicide," the Swiss company said.
In Nestle's powder and liquid beverage business, brands such as Nestle Coffee and Nispeso accounted for a considerable share of the market, with Nestle sales reaching CHF 21.6 billion (about $21.7 billion) in 2018. Nestle reached an agreement last year to sell Starbucks bags of coffee and tea drinks worldwide.
Does glyphosate cause cancer?
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, glyphosate is used in more than 100 food crop cultivations. Scientists from organic food industry environmental protection organizations say that some popular breakfast cereals contain doses of chemicals beyond what they identify as safe for children.
Despite this, EPA claims that glyphosate is not a carcinogen and does not harm public health. In a statement in April, the agency said environmental risks included hazards to pollinators and weed resistance.
But it didn't stop thousands of people from filing lawsuits against the Monsanto company, which claimed to have caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer due to exposure to Nonda.
Earlier this year, a jury ruled that Bayer paid $2 billion in damages to a California couple because they claimed the use of farmland for more than 30 years in their property had resulted in a subsequent diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Cancer Research Institute found that glyphosate "may be carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited" human carcinogenic evidence and "sufficient" animal carcinogenic experimental evidence. However, a joint WHO-United Nations FAO team later concluded that glyphosate was less likely to become carcinogenic through diet.
A man killed his ex-wife in Texas, six family members sentenced
A Utah man was convicted Thursday of killing six family members of his ex-wife in Texas and could face death sentences.
The Harris County jury ruled that 39-year-old Ronald Haskel had been convicted of killing six members of the Sta family in July 2014, including parents Stephen Star and Katie Star, a 13-year-old Brian, nine-year-old Emily, seven-year-old Rebecca and four-year-old Zack.
Harris County District Attorney King Og said in a statement: "We thank the jurors for their attention to every piece of evidence in the case over the past few weeks."
Police said Hassel traveled from California to the suburb of Houston Spring, ambushing his ex-wife's sister, sibling and five children at home.
The Stars and their four children were shot dead in the back of their heads, while the fifth was 15 years old to survive.
Prosecutors have demanded the death penalty for his murder, but jurors will decide whether Khaskl should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
According to KPRC, the U.S. National Broadcasting Corporation's Houston branch, during the interrogation, the defence argued that Haskel was insanity and heard a voice telling him to kill the six men. After reading his verdict on Thursday, he fell down.
According to the television, one of Hasker's defense lawyers, Dodge Durham, said: "I think he could be severely punished as everyone expected."
The sentencing process began on Monday. Haskl's defence lawyer Neil Davis III said his team would work "to save him from death."
According to television, the trial process is expected to last about 2 weeks and a half.
Cassidi testified in court that all of her family were present. According to KPRC, she appeared to be praying before the verdict was read on Thursday.
At a 2014 mourning meeting for her family, Cassidi thanked all walks of life for their support and said parents, two brothers and two sisters "were delighted to see them again in heaven."
Harskill was disguised as a Fed Express driver when he went to Star House, apparently looking for his ex-wife, Katie Star's sister.
The police said he had forcibly entered and tied Cassidi. A few minutes later, when her family came back, Haskl tied them together to ask the ex-wife's whereabouts. They said they didn't know that they were all shotguns in the back of their heads.
Cassidi died after being injured until Haskl left and was able to identify him with the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive her grandparents home to kill them. But the police tracked Khaskl's whereabouts, after a 20-minute police chase and three hours of confrontation, he was arrested.
In view of the U.S. mortality rate, Scotland bans atomized products and e-cigarette advertising
Ministers are considering banning advertisements for e-cigarettes and atomized products.
The Chief Minister has confirmed that consultations on the initiative will take place "in the coming months".
Nicola Sturgeon said that if there is evidence to support further action against the sale of such products, her government will act "without hesitation."
At the same time, there are reports that diseases associated with atomized products have claimed two more lives and killed 11 people.
Oxidated products (a mixture of nicotine, water, solvents and spices used for inhalation) are considered a substitute for smoking that can help to quit smoking, but their safety is not yet fully determined.
But more than 500 people in the U.S. have developed a mysterious pulmonary disease due to e-cigarettes, officials said hundreds of new cases were reported in the past week alone.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Florida and Georgia announced the first cases of death. Currently, 38 states have recorded cases of this disease, eight of which have died.
While most patients have reported using products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (a psychoactive compound in cannabis), deaths in Georgia on Wednesday were reported to be "only a large amount of atomized products."
More than 100 officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have investigated the causes of this mysterious disease and warned citizens not to smoke e-cigarette products before they can learn more, especially those that are modified or purchased on the street.
After the death from atomized products, the chief minister confirmed that the Scottish government is "closely" monitoring developments in the United States and elsewhere.
She points out that so far they have not seen any reports of death cases caused by atomized products in Europe.
"We are cautious, so in Scotland we have adopted the strictest European atomized product regulatory approach."
"The European Tobacco Products Directive restricts the advertising of e-cigarettes and ensures that e-liquids do not contain known harmful ingredients."
"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in e-cigarettes.
"In Scotland, we have also launched a retail registration and mandatory age verification program and funded trade standard departments across all parliamentary areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.
"In the coming months, we will consult on advertising and promotions that completely ban atomized products."
"It's important to emphasize that we all need to keep in mind that these devices are relatively new products, so we should continue to study their impact.
"This may be one reason e-cigarettes have not been popular in Scotland.
"We continue to take all necessary steps, based on best evidence, to ensure that potential harm is avoided."
"While we have put in place the strictest regulatory regime for these products, if there is evidence that further action is needed... we will act without hesitation."
Cambodian court accused of exiled political insurgency
A Cambodian court accused seven senior opposition leaders of plotting an armed insurgency, who plan to end their self-immigration and seek regime change through massive peaceful protests.
The city court in Phnom Penh also warned that anyone who supported the Cambodian opposition to overthrow government plans would be at risk of long-term imprisonment.
If the conviction is established, opposition leaders who end their exiled return may be sentenced to 15 to 30 years in prison and their supporters may be sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. Citing Justice Department spokesman Qin Marlin: Even if they attend a rally or express support online, they can also be seen as plotting to overthrow the government.
The political struggle has intensified since opposition leader San Francisco announced plans to end more than three years of exiled life returning to his homeland on November 9, seeking "restore democracy", and Thursday's court charges will trigger the latest round of confrontation.
November 9 is the day of Cambodia's independence, and in 1953 it withdrew from French colonial rule.
Sanransi said on Twitter earlier this week: "I will continue to call upon the Cambodian people and armed forces to oppose the Hun Sen regime until the Hun Sen regime restores its opposition's right to participate in the country's political life, including real elections."
Last year's pre-election court disbanded San Francisco's opposition party to ensure that Hun Sensen continues to have a more authoritarian regime for 40 years.
The opposition party, which wanted to launch a strong electoral challenge in July 2018, was widely seen as politically motivated and the ruling Cambodian People's Party led by Hun Sen feared losing its position in the election.
The Hun Sen government appears to be disturbed by the planned return of opposition leaders, which, while seemingly impractical, calls for a large number of Cambodian workers in Thailand to come back with him.
Officials vowed to arrest him as soon as he arrived in Cambodia, but also speculated that Cambodia might simply block San Francisco's entry into the country and could be barred from boarding flights to Cambodia if airlines were officially informed of the ban. Neighbouring countries are unlikely to allow San Francisco to enter Cambodia from their territory either.
However, the government has tightened arrests of San Francisco's supporters and reports that opposition organizers have recently been physically assaulted.
At the end of 2015, Sanransi was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal defamation and exiled abroad in order to avoid imprisonment. After that, the local government filed other judicial proceedings against Sanransi.
In late 2017, in the crackdown on all anti-Hung Sen regimes, opposition co-founder Genzoca was arrested and other high-ranking members of the party were exiled. He is accused of treason for establishing ties with a democracy-backed U.S. organization and currently under tight house arrest.
This year's Turner Prize finale will be exhibited in Magate from tomorrow, and Brexit will also be on the agenda.
The Columbian artist Oscar Murillo's work, "Social cataract", depicts the landscape of people looking at the North Sea, but their view of the North Sea and the continental European border is obscured by a black canvas that reveals only a small fraction of the distance through a slash on the canvas.
The work is one of four final works, a 1984 annual art award awarded to artists living in the UK or British-born but living elsewhere.
Curator Fio Napari explained that Murillo's work focused primarily on the current political and socio-economic situation in Britain. This group of film puppets represents a globalized workforce, while black cloth represents "the dark moments of contemporary England and even globally."
She added: "I think it's a broader meaning to obscure the horizon, which actually means shielding sight from any distant view. There is also a position that blocks light. But I still have a line of hope with a slant on the canvas and you can see the sea in the horizon."
At the same time, Helen Cammocker's video "A Long Note" explores women's roles that have been overlooked in the Delhi/London Derry Civil Rights Movement of Northern Ireland beginning in 1968. It also deals with a broader global class, race and gender struggle at the end of the 1960s.
All works will be exhibited from 28 September to 12 January 2020 in Margate's contemporary gallery, and the 2019 Turner Prize winner will be announced at the award ceremony on December 3.
The award, named after the 19th-century British landscape painter Joseph Maraud William Turner, has been reddish by Grayson Perry, Damien Herst and Steve McQueen, director of "Twelve Years for Slavery."
Details of the abduction and tortured abuse of plastic surgeons by men are unequivocal
A Florida man admitted to abducting a plastic surgeon and abused him using spray lights for extortion.
According to the Sun Sentinel, 34-year-old Justin Bosio acknowledged Thursday's kidnapping and plotting details of the January attack on a surgeon whose identity has not yet been disclosed.
Boriso's lawyer Kenneth Lange said his client was involved in the abduction, at the encouragement of the co-accused Sitch Corina, who would be extradited from Tenerife, Spain.
According to court documents, the surgeon was hijacked and pushed into a van when he left Walmart's store by a man with weapons. After suffering hours of torture, he returned to his car unconsciously.
Britain's Second Congress Refuses to Hold Elections Early
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was once again frustrated in pushing ahead with the UK's early elections.
The Speaker of the House of Commons said it was impossible to vote before October 31 (the day Britain planned to leave the EU).
Since the Supreme Court's ruling to suspend the election, this is the second time Parliament has held a meeting.
Meanwhile, EU chief negotiator Michael Banier said the EU is still waiting for a new plan on Britain's side.
U.S. troops sent to Saudi Arabia and deployed air defense systems to deter Iran's attack
U.S. officials announced Thursday that the United States is sending a Patriot missile force, four sets of ground radar systems and 200 support forces to Saudi Arabia to curb Iran's increasingly aggressive actions.
The Pentagon said that if necessary, a SAD missile defense system and two other Patriots missile forces were ready.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said: "Other countries in the region have called for attention to the situation in Iran and we hope that they will contribute to international cooperation and strengthen Saudi defense forces."
Last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it would deploy more troops to the Middle East as a "defence" measure to help defend against attacks from Iran.
Esper said the deployment was a first step towards resolving Iran's rampant violence in the region, including drone strikes at Saudi oil facilities this month, and he called on other countries to step up their actions and denounce those attacks.
Iran-backed Yemeni Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for the September 14 attack on the world's largest oil processing plant and a major oilfield, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemned Iran.
"It's clear that the weapons used are Iranian-made and not fired from Yemen," Esper said Friday, pointing out all indications that Iran is responsible for the attack.
The purpose of deploying troops and resources is "to send a clear message from the United States in support of our partners" and to provide "free flow of resources," Esper said.
Secretary of State said the United States called on other countries to "stand up and condemn the attack" and contribute.
Meghan Markle 'never invited' to return to Golden Lawyer
Alan Cols, the founder of Goldman's Lawyer, said that he "never invited" British Duchess Meghan Markle to return to the show and starred at Rachel Zann in the big finale.
After the finale of Goldman's Lawyer was aired in the United States, Colshes was asked in an interview with the U.S. Hollywood News frontline whether it was "possible" to invite the ex-resident actor to "invite."
"Now we've finished the big finale, and I can tell you," Kolshes replied.
"I've thought of inviting her and using audio material (which we have to think about), but I didn't start at the end because I felt like 'I want to respect her new life and can't put her in a position that must be invited.'
"We decided not to put her in such a situation, so I never started."
In the finale of The Golden Lawyer, the Duchess of Sussex appeared in Montaigne's picture.
From 2011, Meghan played Rachel Zann in the New York-based drama until last year's final episode.
In her final season, Rachel's screen husband Mike Rose (played by Patrick Johnny Adams) visited her from Seattle and asked about her recent situation.
"If I tell you how good she's been, you probably wouldn't believe me," he replied.
Bitt Bulldog Killed to Protect Florida Boys from Snakebiting
A Florida man said his eight-month-old bitch bulldog, Zeus, was killed by a snake in order to protect several of his sons.
Gary Richardson told WOFL television that his family lived in Samt County, Florida, and on Monday a toxic coral snake crawled toward them as several of his sons cleaned the "Zeus" water tray outside their homes. Richardson said the children weren't seeing snakes at the time, but dogs saw it and launched an attack on snakes.
According to Richardson, the snake bited Zeus four times. Although Zeus was sent by fire to the veterinary department, he died the next day of the attack.
Germany reports an iconic case of the West Nile virus
The first human case of the West Nile virus transmitted through mosquitoes occurred in Germany, and climate change clearly accelerated the spread of the virus.
Germany's National Center for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine said Friday that the patient had concurrent encephalitis but recovered after treatment at the hospital.
The West Nile virus originated in Africa but has spread northward through migratory birds and mosquitoes. In recent years, there have been several outbreaks in southern and central Europe. Cases have also been confirmed in most parts of the United States.
Jonas Schmidt Chanasset of the Bernhard Nokter Institute for Tropical Medicine in Germany said: "Because of climate change, unusually hot summers over the past two years have clearly accelerated the spread of the West Nile virus to the north of the Alps."
Less than 1% of patients infected with the virus are at risk of meningitis or encephalitis.
After prostate cancer surgery, skipping radiotherapy is good.
A major study found that men who underwent prostate cancer surgery were in good condition without radiotherapy.
Examination of patients undergoing surgical treatment is the largest experiment to date, with results that could liberate thousands of patients from being tortured and can also have painful side effects.
Royal Masden Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men treated with prostate cancer.
Half of these patients received instant radiotherapy, which is the standard treatment to date for preventing recurrence of diseases. The rest were monitored and given only when signs of relapse occurred.
Five years later, scientists found that there was little difference between the rates of relapse in both groups of patients, and those who did not receive radiotherapy were slightly better.
The progression-free survival rate of the radiotherapy group is 85%, and the standard care group is 88%.
Due to other factors, the data has been adjusted and the difference between the two groups is about 1%.
The study, funded by the British Cancer Research Center, found that patients receiving radiation treatment were twice as likely to experience worsening of urinary incontinence as those who did not receive radiation therapy, one of the main side effects of prostate cancer treatment.
One year after surgery, 5.3% of patients treated with radiation worsened and only 2.7% of those who received standard care deteriorated.
Radio claims that the Louisiana WWF radio show host Seth Danrap threatened to prosecute anti-gay tweets, but the tweet was actually sent by himself, as in the case of Jusie Smolitt.
A radio host in New Orleans said he had received an anti-gay defamation tweet sent to him by the radio's Twitter account. WL host Seth Danrap, a public gay man, said on Wednesday that he intended to prosecute the radio parent company as he had worked for years in a hostile and disgusting environment. Thursday, something strangely reversed, with the New Orleans Police Department saying that Tanrap received homophobic tweets not from elsewhere, but rather from Thanrap's phone.
The controversial tweet was sent in early this month, and on that day Danrap also hosted his own program as usual. According to CBS's WL-TV report, the tweet was issued the next day when he announced his leave.
Dan Lap said in a statement that 14 people had access to the WL Twitter account, claiming he wasn't the only one who used it.
His lawyer, Meghan Keaver, said he had decided to take part in a lie-detection so as to dispel suspicions that he was the culprit. According to WL-TV reports, Danrap has not yet filed a lawsuit, but he said it would proceed soon.
WL Radio is a branch of CBS News, but it's spread all over, WL Radio said in a statement that it had investigated the tweet and decided to hand it over to law enforcement officials. "WL has completed an investigation into this extremely unruly and unauthorized tweet sent by its Twitter account on September 10, which directly defamed Sys Denrap."
"We believe that the most appropriate next step is to be handled by law enforcement agencies. The current investigation is carried out by law enforcement agencies, and we are inconvenient to comment more on the specifics of the findings," WL said in a statement.
The New Orleans Police Department disclosed their investigation into the tweet and in a police report on Thursday, the story turned around: This homophobic tweet was allegedly sent from Dan Lap's private phone.
Radio moderator Sys Danrap once said he had worked for many years in a climate of homophobia and hostility. After claiming to have received anti-defamation tweets from radio Twitter accounts, he threatened to prosecute.
According to NOLA.com, WLL accuses Danrap of threatening the radio solely for money. WL claims that the 35-year-old radio host said he would pursue the tweet and then ask for more than $1.8 million in compensation. According to a police report obtained by Nola.com, WL points out that Danlap is facing personal financial problems when it threatens to prosecute.
The charges were filed by WLL's senior vice president, Kevin Cassidi, and his parent company's lawyer. Police are still doing their best to confirm these allegations, but the case has been classified as potentially extortionous. Louisiana defines extortion as "a threatening message to others in order to obtain anything worthwhile."
Viola Davis plays Michelle Obama in First Lady
Viola Davis said playing Michelle Obama in the latest television series made her feel "troubling."
The 54-year-old actress spoke on Thursday's Jimmy Chicken Show about her role as Michelle Obama in the U.S. TV series 'First Lady'!
Davis said she had met Michelle Obama, but didn't know if the ex-first lady knew her role.
"I'm very nervous," Davis said, "I don't care what I have done in my life - I won the Emmy Award, Oscars, and two Tony Awards - but if this time I messed up, the impact on my life would be huge."
She jokingly said, "It's like 'you raised a great child, but you screwed up Michelle Obama.'
However, Davis said she was confident in the screenplay of writer Aaron Cooley. Davids and Cooley would also be executive producers of the show.
"I assure you, this script is great," Davis said, "Listen, I don't want to make my people mad."
In First Lady, we will explore the political and personal life of first-time husbands in American history. Season 1 focuses on Elino Roosevelt, Betty Ford and Michelle Obama.
In addition to the First Lady, Davis will be reunited with Danzel Washington in NetFlight's Adapted Mother Rainy Black Butter Dance, where Danzel Watson and he co-starred Out of Adversity and The Barrier.
"I had to wear a rich suit," Davis told host Jimmy Canmore, "I like this suit. I told them I wanted very, very big [snarling]."
Davis plays Anna Lisa Keating in the U.S. broadcaster's series On The Fire, which premiered its sixth and final season on Thursday.
Mike Miller's death: third man accused of drug trafficking
A third man has been arrested and charged with drug trafficking, a man linked to the death of rapper Mike Miller's overdose.
Steven Walter was suspected of selling counterfeit hydroxyketone pills that were compounded with fentanyl, and Miller had accidentally died last year from overdose cocaine, alcohol and powerful opioids, prior to his death.
Walter was accused of being the source of another man, Cameron Petit, who had sold the drug to Miller.
Ryan Reeves, 36, who was arrested this week in Lake Hawasu, Arizona, is accused of being Walter's "runner-up" and having given the drug to Petit.
Walter was arrested for a 2005 drug case and is currently in custody.
Miller is a Pittsburgh man whose real name is Malcolm James Miles McCormick, who frankly discusses his depression and drug use in his lyrics, which has earned him some of the big fans of hip-hop.
He ended his two-year relationship with Aliana Grande in early 2018. After Miller's death, she posted a video on her photo wall page full of love for him and released a song "Thank you Next", which was deeply affectionate to Miler.
In recent years, some musicians have died of opioid abuse and overdose throughout the country, one of which is Miller.
Prince died in 2016 when he took a counterfeit drug containing fentanyl, which looked like an imitation of the painkiller Vicodin.

Women don't hang in Walmart to prove innocence
In a Wal-Mart supermarket in Mexico City, a woman accused of shoplifting took extreme means of self-confidence, standing in the supermarket without stalking, leaving Supermarket security to be astounded.
Earlier this week, a supermarket security guard was moving toward the woman suspected of stealing and she was close to the supermarket exit. However, when she was stopped, her reaction made the security officer unequivocal.
The woman took off her dress and then started to go out, but she might feel that she was still very defiant, quickly turned around to take off her shirt. After taking off a strand of non-smoking, she held clothes in her hand and left the supermarket gasily.
The naked shopper's identity is still unknown, but it looks like she was allowed to leave after the improvised stripping show.
In July, in a Walmart supermarket in Simiflin town, surveillance cameras photographed a Pennsylvania woman unloading the box of potatoes. The video showed that she was clearly drunk on charges of public indecency, drinking in public, destroying property and disrupting social security, and quickly turning red.
This week, another Britannic Steve Whitehurst was forced to naked in the supermarket because he found that his pants had no known "booby" and so he had to expose himself to security guards.
"I was born that way, and I couldn't," Whitehurst told The Sun.

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that advanced centrifuges at Iran's Natanz Nuclear Facility are "accumulating or ready to accumulate enriched uranium."
Since last May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran is gradually violating the restrictions of the 2015 nuclear agreement with major powers.
The agreement provides that Iran can only refine uranium with the first-generation IR-1 centrifuge.

The women's league is expected to defend the World Cup in advance!
On the 27th, in the match against the Dutch women's league, the Chinese team was reintroduced into a city by their opponents to win two consecutive runs, ending with 3:1 lick of the Netherlands, and winning nine straight lines.
The World Cup's track is close to the end, although the defending is waiting, but in the face of the Serbian team, China's women's league still cannot be lightly defeated.
With the Netherlands in the first two games, China's women's league performance is as strong as ever, with 25:19, 25:16 respectively to descend from the two cities until the third division, the team encountered a setback.
The Dutch women's league reinforced the aggressiveness of playback in the case of backwards, a Chinese team story was hit, plus girls offensive heartfelt, and mistakes began to increase, eventually with 21:25 pushed back into a city by opponents.
In an interview, he also pointed out: "The third place because of the error we sent about 8 points."
Of course, the Dutch women's league strength should not be underestimated, and Chinese women's league before the match was also prepared for difficulties, although losing a single game, but everything is still in Lung Ping's control, "and the strong teams play games to lose and win are normal, playing five runs is also normal, so we tell the team members to focus," Langping said.
The fourth division, the team members actively adjust the state, Zhang Changning in the offensive end firepower fully opened, the single bureau got 8 points, for the team to win a big game.
To date, the 11 rounds of the match are currently only two rounds left, although a hand has touched the championship trophy, but in the game against the Netherlands did hit China's women's league alarm: the more crucial moment, the more effort will be made.
In another match on the 27th, Russian and American women's leagues were filled with five runs, United States teams failed to take three points from their opponents, so that as long as Chinese women's leagues took three points against Serbia, they could defend themselves in advance.
The situation is unfolding in a positive way for the Chinese women's platoon.
However, although the Serbian team has lost a lot of weight in these six majors, this does not mean that they will easily send three points to the Chinese team.
From the perspective of the current form of the scoreboard, the Serbian team has basically no medals, which means that they can "play lightly" in the match against the Chinese women's league, put down the baggage to fully impact opponents, while the Chinese team is under the pressure to win the title, and the state may appear up and down.
In addition, the replacement Serbian team is not a "manual slaughter" lamb, after the battle with the Netherlands, the two sides in the 5th round of the war, and the Serbian side finally 3:2 reversed the Dutch main force lineup, thus showing the depth of its lineup.
Before the third stage of the game, Lang Ping also said that both teams were not good at dealing with: "Osaka will be very difficult, we still have to prepare as always."
Today, the defending horn has already sounded, and the game has really entered the "white thermal stage".
On the lineup of power, China's women's league is above opponents, just the last critical point, but also to see whether the girls can play their normal level and free themselves at the game.

On September 24, a "a ferry ticket takes me to see" love and disability event was held in the head of Changsha Orange continent, more than 100 people from Changsha were invited to board the orange star cruise ship, admire the magnificent scenery of Xiangjiang, jointly celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Most of the more than 100 people with disabilities who participated in this event were on cruise ships for the first time.
Zhao Zhengang, 56, is a frail person who rarely leaves because of inconvenience to his feet.
He said: "This is the first time I ride a cruise ship today to appreciate the bulge of Xiangjiang, feel the growth pulse of Changsha and be very excited.
Volunteers from the Fukukan Social Work Service Center and Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provide fine-tuning services for disabled people.
In particular, those who are severely physically handicapped will be followed by volunteers on their upper and lower cruises.
For 70 years, with the support of the party and the government, Changsha City's disability career has continued to develop and progress, more and more people with disabilities have become truly participants in socio-economic development, contributors and beneficiaries, care for helping disabled people and concern for supporting the cause of disabled people has also gradually become a common consensus.
The Republic is about to celebrate its 70th anniversary, the light of the media in all directions shines brightly, so that many ordinary images we do not remember very much, flashing - and it is they who bring heat for our shiny days, with a wirl of lights...
However, if the hero walks around, it also seems ordinary as you are like me.
Yuan Longping, insidious rice research, breeding good crops throughout the world, so that more than a billion people no longer have the risk of starvation and discouragement, can not be explained, this man is usually like an old farmer who likes to walk on the field; South Ringdong, hard work to make China's "eye" irritated chief scientist, one person, for a lifetime, a pot, only one thing in life, in the deep mountains of Guizhou swallowed cold buns, and the old man in the cottage nothing two; Zhou Yuchang, Redologist, a young village boy who was very late at opening, still as a white child, studied in the middle and west, with a crumbling white hair, told about the meeting point, liked laughing.
They are loving, merciful, living plainly and firmly, as long as they indulge in the outsiders' undisturbed and their brooming careers, they will easily live happily, without care for the name reins, rich and prosperous.
As in the Qur'an, he was a sorcerer who had not been able to do anything about it and did not know what they were going to do with him.
Every "sweeping monk" and every cradle of the redhead has a place behind me that belongs to his own country.
The home country is burdened not only on the shoulders of heroes, but also in the hands of millions of people.
"When a hero passes through, there is always someone sitting on the side of the road applauding......I don't want to be a hero, I want to be an acclaimer at the side of the road."
In fact, when a hero and acclamation to the hero is not contradictory.
The people who acclaim the road are also passing heat and light, they are also emitters.
Ordinary as you and like me, there are always some chances in life, some moments, a numbness, and also shaping the hero's image.
Shanghai's outstanding judge Zou Bihua, shouldering a heavy responsibility for judicial reform, but at the annual meeting let the communication room teacher Fu to tell his own story, received countless newspaper letters from year after year, from no fault, "to do simple things, is not easy", Zou Bihua led the judges to give applause to this "Sweeping monk" style old hair.
This is the adoration between the heroes, a hero who applauds another hero.
The sweeping monk has Shaolin Temple and Tibet, Yuan Longping has vast rice experimental fields, Nan Ringdong has "eyes of heaven", Qin Yi has a stage, Zhou Yuchang has a pulpit...... Can be a hero, not alone on his own efforts, but also have a good environment and positive incentives.
For example, "China's Eye", now it seems to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China's scientific and technological community was still hard to climb down, and novelist Liu Jixin has not yet written "Three Dimensions".
The cow's "eye" at that time was the one-sided caliber radio telescope in Puerto Rico's valley, Aresibo, with a diameter of 350 meters, considered to be the most "unsurpassable" world.
At that time, China's radio telescope was less than one-tenth of the diameter.
And South Ringdong, who enjoys world-class research conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back a nearly crazy idea: to build a new generation of radio "big telescope" in China, receiving more information from outer space!
China's 100% wastefulness, investing in big money to play the stars?
The motherland trusts South Ringdong, and the "eye of heaven" project is illuminating.
The site was used for 12 years, and the finalization is another 9 years.
The 500-meter diameter "eye of heaven" opens, and China has made no precedent for the "universal scientific engineering in the world".
So, the "eyes of heaven" is remarkable, South Ringdong people are great, there can be a great and far-reaching republic.
With the confidence of the country, the goodwill of the nationals, South Ringdong has the opportunity to become the liver of the soul and people of the country.
There are young talents, white hair heroically passed through, there are people gently applauding at the side of the road, such a country is beautiful and harmonious.
The idea of environmental protection from the dolls began with garbage classification education in Jilin kindergarten
On 27th, the first kindergarten in Jilin province carried out garbage classification education classes and taught young children to distinguish recyclable trash and other categories of garbage.
It is reported that this is the first time garbage classification has entered local early childhood education classes.
Recently, Jilin province's nine departments jointly issued the "Jilin province to promote the classification of urban living garbage disposal work".
In 2019, based on the pilot classification of living garbage in Changchun City, the province decided to conduct life-disposal classification work at the local level.
The city of Gilling is one of them.
Through this event, we hope to achieve the effect of driving families by young children, guiding society by kindergartens and promoting environmental concepts.
Liu Lijuan, the executive gardener of Hi Fan International Kindergarten, said at the event.
On the same day, the gardener read out an environmental initiative book, hoping that garbage classification will begin with children.
After performing the "Low Carbon Baby" dance, the children started classifying garbage games.
The instructors also issued "recyclable" "other garbage" labels, recommending that children stick the label to the trash can and record small videos after returning home.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has been advocating low-carbon, green environmental concepts and regularly opens environmental lecture halls.
The garbage dump site in the garden also has a classifiable trash bin, which is marked by the type of dump.
Teachers teach children what can be recycled garbage geese
According to preliminary statistics, in 2018, the amount of urban living garbage produced in Jilin province was about 5.4652 million tons, and all of them went into the sewage treatment site for processing.
Among them, sanitation landfills 3.2929 million tons, incineration of 2.0923 million tons, and the integrated utilization process treatment of 801 thousand tons.
After many years of effort, all municipalities and counties in the province have the ability to treat living wastes in an environmentally sound manner.
The work programme on the promotion of land-level urban living garbage disposal in Jilin Province has clearly called for an in-depth operation of garbage classification into campus, teaching materials, classrooms and other activities, through creation of garbage classification songs, chords, comics, microvideos and other works, to strengthen interaction between students and parents, reaching the effect of "education a child, influence a family, drive a community, cultivate a generation of new people".

Sales of minivans such as "Demio" have decreased.
Chirac's death is a political legacy.
On 26 local time, former French President Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is in an unchanging century, many of the political legacy left by this French politician during his reign remains worthy of our praise.
Hirac has been president of France for 12 years in a very personal manner.
He has inherited the spirit of de Gaulle's independent and independent diplomacy, as well as his strong support for European integration, and is a representative of the pursuit of "European Dreams".
At the same time, he vigorously advocates world multipolarity and multilateralism, a politician with strategic vision.
That's why the French media applauded him as "the outstanding representative of France on the world stage".
One of Chirac's delightful political decisions is to oppose the U.S.-led Iraq War.
Under his leadership, France joined forces with Germany to withstand U.S. pressure and stand in the forefront of anti-war.
A year after the war broke out, he predicted that Iraq's war would lead to increased terrorist activity and make the world even more dangerous.
Later, the facts proved that Chirac's warning was correct.
In the moment when European integration is stumbling and unilateralism in the United States has become more prominent, Chirac's strategic thinking and choice for international politics and global affairs undoubtedly has a strong enlightening meaning.
Hirac is also a French politician who has made the Chinese more familiar and affectionate.
He was one of the advocates and creators of China-France relations in the "golden decade", and after his first election as President of France in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with the strategic vision of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and the bilateral exchanges between China and France entered a new stage.
During Chirac's reign, the bilateral trade volume between China and France grew rapidly, and cooperation in aviation, nuclear power and rail transport has made groundbreaking progress.
The Xirac Initiative's Year of Chinese and French Culture created a brand-new cultural exchange model in the history of China and France.
Chirac's passion for Chinese culture is particularly impressive.
According to his Chinese diplomat, Chirac can take back some of Li Bai and Dufu's Psalms, and even accurately judge the history of China's bronze.
"Don't look at the pyramids that didn't really come to Egypt, don't look at the terracotta masquerades that didn't really come to China" - this golden sentence comes from Chirac.
"The West is concerned about China's political and social development, the ecological problems caused by its economic growth, and China's political status internationally.
I am confident in China myself.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilisation, and its experience is sufficient to help it build ideas and values for achieving harmonious development.

The Hong Kong SAR Legislature's Constituent Members Adopt the Port-U.S. Bill
The HKSAR Legislature's partially formed members issued a joint statement on the 27th, expressing strong opposition to the adoption of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Bill 2019 by the two extra-parliamentary committees of the United States Congress.
The statement, co-sponsored by 40 formed MPs, states that Hong Kong's current rights are conferred on the Basic Law of the HKSAR, including maintaining the status of free trade ports and separate customs zones, signing and implementing bilateral and multilateral agreements in various fields such as economic, financial, shipping, trade, communications, tourism, culture, sports, etc. In terms of business, cooperation and development relations with different countries and regions around the world under the name "Hong Kong China".
These rights are not granted by any foreign government or legislature.
Since then, Hong Kong has strictly adhered to international agreements, international rules, legal and business ethics, traded with different countries and regions, participated in cooperation in many related fields, the achievements are excellent and visible.
The statement said that the move by the two congressional committees of the United States Senate to pass relevant bills is unnecessary, just as a means of blatant interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seeking political chips for its agents in Hong Kong.
The formed legislators expressed deep regret that the United States would do so and strongly opposed it.
Hong Kong is an important trading partner and the source of the largest trade surplus in the United States.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, fair and free business environment, and ingenious society make it a good place for American merchants to do business.
If the United States adopts this bill, in addition to fighting Hong Kong and the interests of the United States itself, it will also exacerbate China-US relations with no benefit.
The statement said that Hong Kong will, as always, unwaveringly implement the "one country, two systems" approach and continue to enjoy the rights conferred by the Basic Law and effectively fulfil its obligations.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to make its due contribution to the international community and international trade.
According to the European Times, two chambers of the French parliament will discuss immigration policy reform next week.
President Emmanuel Macron recently claimed that France could not "accept all", but at the same time tried to "appropriately accept".
Macron is trying to find a cut-off route on immigration matters, slowing the impending debate.
Macron said in an interview during the General Assembly's general debate in New York, he hopes to have a real "double-track" migration policy that seeks balance between humanitarian and efficiency.
Macron said: "If France wants to properly admit (immigrants), it can't accept everyone."
Macron lists four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum qualifications to refugees in need of protection as soon as possible; promoting migration integration more efficiently; receiving and protecting all migrants entering French territory; and relocating those who are not suitable for illegal entry into France more effectively.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the "national medical assistance" (AME) system is one of the most discussed topics before.
Macron said he wanted to "assess" the system, but not eliminate it, but limit it.
After Macron's remarks, far-right leader Le Pen tweeted that Macron's statement was "empty talk."
The right-wing Republican member, Senate Speaker Rashehr, also said that immigration policies should be discussed in a "slowdown" but "faced to reality" manner, indirectly criticizing Macron.
Left Socialist MP Varao believes that France should "accept more and better" on immigration issues, and criticizes Macron for "manipulating" the issue.
The new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which has been promulgated for a year, has led to disagreements within the ruling party but at the same time is unable to appease the right-wing opposition.
In the next 2022 general election, immigration policy topics will once again become the focus of far-right attacks and Macron needs to make a difference on this issue, but at the same time risk inciting leftists inside the ruling party.
The lower house of the French National Assembly will be debating immigration policy on September 30, while the Senate will debate it on October 2.
There are indications that China's A shares are ushering in a "buyback boom", and many listed companies have come out of "true gold silver" to buy back the company's shares.
According to the statistics of financial data service provider Oriental wealth, as of 27th, the total amount of repurchase implementation of A shares listed companies in 2019 has exceeded 100 billion yuan (renminbi, lower one), far higher than previous year's data, creating a record high number of funds for repurchase of A shares.
In this regard, Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Meikorong Information Consulting Co., Ltd. said that the overall valuation of the A stock market this year is low, with relatively low prices to buy back shares, it is conducive to listed companies to improve the efficiency of use of funds, and also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market capitalization and ample cash flow situation, which is conducive to boosting investor confidence.
In addition, the continuous improvement of the system of share buybacks has also led to the active implementation of stock buybacks by listed companies.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued implementing rules for repurchases of shares by listed companies, providing detailed stock buyback norms and guidelines to listed companies.
According to media statistics, since this year, listed companies that have implemented an increase in repurchase plans mainly focus on the infrastructure industry, real estate industry, information technology industry and electronic equipment manufacturing.
In addition, from the point of view of repurchase payment amount, six listed companies have repurchased more than 1 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first place is Illi shares, and its repurchase amounted to more than 5 billion yuan.
What will the repurchase of shares by listed companies affect the market?
Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the Chinese People's University School of Finance and Finance, said in an interview with CNN reporters that repurchase shows on the one hand that listed companies have strong economic strength and a better financial situation, are able to maintain stock price stability, give investors confidence; on the other hand, also show that listed companies and their controlling shareholders are responsible for the company, market responsibility and accountable to investors.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, and the latter requires listed companies and their controlling shareholders to have a higher quality.
For capital markets, this is the most basic element.
The repurchase of shares by listed companies is conducive to boosting investor confidence and supporting the stock prices of listed companies.
According to Eastern Securities Research, according to the total number of expected stock buybacks set by a listed company since the beginning of this year, as well as the average exchange rate calculated for repurchased shares, this year's incremental funds brought into the A share market are expected to exceed 150 billion yuan.

Shandong Xu Guang County Committee Secretary Wang Burxiang - Qiangzhou Fumin Red Son Heart- Xinhua Network
Wang Beixiang, Shandong Shuguang People, born in February 1943, participated in the work in 1967, and then served as a secretary of the township party committee, county committee secretary, mayor and so on.
In 1986, Wang Berxiang was secretary of the Shuguang County Committee in Shandong Province, and at that time it was Weifang's poor county.
In the past five years, Wang Bhu Xiang with a heart for the people, concentrated his efforts have done three things: one is to promote the industrialization of vegetables; second is to develop saline and alkali beach in Saul Bei; third is to set the foundation for the industrial transformation, so that shui people from this time raised their pockets and raised their waist.
The sushi farmers have a tradition of cultivating, and there are lessons learned from cultivating.
In the early 1980s, Shu Guang Farmers' crop yields could not be sold and rotten in the ground.
Wang Baixiang research found that the key to picking up vegetables is to make good circulation.
Shou Light pioneered the establishment of a wholesale vegetable market, and opened the prelude to the development of a market economy.
The party's cadres are going to take the lead, screw it up, and all the losses in the county.
In 1989, with Wang Burxiang's support, 17 members of the party created 17 winter and warm vegetable shafts, which in that year made up 17 "two million yuan households".
Afterwards, a promotion team was established in the county, and under Wang's mobilisation, Wang Luyi guided tour of each township; more than 5000 vegetable sheds were promoted in the first year, after which the vegetable sheds were pushed to the entire county and even the whole country.
For thousands of years, 1.6 million acres of land in addition to saline and alkali beach is a shallow beach coating.
The local people's life is very arduous.
There is a vegetable stall, what can you do in the north?
Wang Baixiang organized more than 100,000 people to fight in the General Assembly, camping on the desert alkaline beach, one thing is 450 days.
Wang Baixiang and the county's leading cadres eat on the work site, like civil workers pick up trucks, wind food and shelter, people see them all stretch their thumb, heart to admire... At that time, Shubei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp pool, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 600,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "poly treasure pot" in saline and alkali beaches.
In July 1986, Wang Baixiang first participated in the Weifang Industrial Conference as a county committee secretary.
During the meeting, we sent a "Digital Comparison Table of Industrial and Economic Economy in Weifang City 12 counties", at first glance industrial output value, sushi is good, ranking fourth.
But if the original salt is taken away, the pure industrial output value of syroke remains only 119 million yuan, ranking third in the downside.
Wang Baixiang took more than 70 people to take a break, and ran to the field for "change of mind".
Less than a year back, the whole county invested 150 million yuan and embarked on 77 projects.
Since then, it has been organized every year to "take a mission" to Shenzhen, Dongguan and Shanghai.
A lack of business and a lack of entrepreneur.
Wang Boxiang presided over the theme conference: in the whole county to publicly select the plant manager, 40 "skilled and capable people" stand out, pushed into the industrial front.
In 1991, Shuguang entered the country's top 100 counties and Wang Burxiang transferred to Weifang City Deputy Mayor.
He left behind more than 200,000 vegetable sheds, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields and shrimp pools, 4,854 enterprises, more than 100,000 "million households", is recognized by the people's cadre team.
On September 26, local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted a meeting of foreign ministers from China and the African member states of the Security Council at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cote d &apos; Ivoire, Tango, Equatorial Guinea, Oyono, South Africa, Pandora and the President-in-Office Member States, Nigeria, Carla and Tunisian Foreign Minister Jesinawi.
Wang Yi made four proposals for strengthening cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First, by uniting power.
The biggest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, which has a direct consequence of the fundamental norms of international relations being challenged and the role of the United Nations being shaken to the detriment of developing countries as a whole, including African countries, and small and medium-sized countries.
To cope with this challenge, China and Africa need hands-on, shoulder-to-shoulder, unity to be strong.
In the Council, the three African countries speak with one voice and focus is not just 3 votes, but the entire African continent.
China and Africa stand together, not just four votes, but will drive other countries to follow up, influence and shape the Council's agenda.
Since 2018, China has established a "3+1" coordination mechanism with the African members of the Council to fully utilize this coordination mechanism.
Second, to resolve disputes through consultation.
China has been advocating for a political solution to hot issues, and Africa has good traditions of consultations, as well as the experience of successful good offices by African regional and sub-regional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the Council &apos; s agenda, particularly in Africa, are rooted in colonialism and some directly linked to external factors.
Together, we should use Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations to play the role of the United Nations in good offices, mediation and so on.
Thirdly, self-reliance.
African countries and peoples are most aware of Africa &apos; s problems, and Africa is also capable and wise in resolving its own problems.
The Council should focus on listening to and respecting Africa &apos; s will, play the role of regional and subregional organizations and encourage and support innate solutions from Africa.
China is willing to strengthen coordination with the African side and firmly promote capacity-building for self-sustaining peace operations in Africa.
Fourthly, it is rooted in development.
China and the majority of African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on placing economic and social development at the first place to support each other in their chosen development path.
China is willing to align the joint "Belt and Road" with the 2063 Agenda of the African Union, the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030, and the development strategies of African countries so as to help African countries enhance their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
Together, we must promote the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
The outbreak of Ebola in the Congo has re-emerged, and China has and will continue to lend its full support to provide manpower and material assistance as far as possible, and is willing to coordinate actions with African countries to mobilize more aid from the United Nations, WHO and others to play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Congo (MONUC).

This time Trudeau stumbled out of the "big pit" with his head, and it was Trudeau himself who dug a little.
Recently, the Canadian media repeatedly exposed many old photographs of current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau dressed himself as a black image.
This is considered to be an apparent act of racial discrimination, which has sparked outrage in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, the Canadians don't buy much.
Trudeau counted on moving the stone to smash his feet.
As political commentator Riley et al. pointed out, since the rise of the "anti-blackface movement" from the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been blaming opposition parties or dissenters in their own party for "losses" in this regard, and repeatedly threatened that "anyone who makes this mistake should be dismissed immediately."
Simply put, this time the "big pit" that stumbled on Trudeau's head was just a little digging out of Trudeau himself.
Trudeau was the son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and handsome man who had slapped a whirlwind of "political icons" when he came out.
He was originally a "politician" who took over the Federal Liberal Party, and fought an unexpectedly beautiful battle in the 2015 Canadian federal legislative elections - half of the Fed's seat in the lower house.
At that time, Trudeau put forward many deaf strategies and ideas such as "ethnicity and gender equality", "environmental ecology" and "economic revival", emphasizing the elimination of corruption and "incorrect winds".
However, for five years in power, he has been twitching on almost all of the above aspects, "high and low."
With regard to the issue of "ethnicity and gender equality", let go of this "black face" incident, after he has been "incompetent" on a series of Aboriginal issues, so that indigenous groups and leaders moved protest tents to the entrance of the Capitol Hill Town Hall during the 150th anniversary of Canada's founding.
In the fight against corruption, at the end of last year Trudeau was embroiled in a blossoming "ranvan spirit incident".
He was exposed to serious violations of personal malpractice and frauds against his hometown construction engineering company "Lang Wanling", pressured departments and officials responsible for the investigation, demanding that the latter "highly lift their hands".
Moreover, Trudeau was irritated by officials who disclosed the case - Wang Yudi mentioned earlier - as Canada's current Attorney General for the first time to disclose the case and directly handle the case.
Although the case itself has doubts, its suspicions are difficult to purify.
Many observers pointed out that Trudeau's five-year reign of people collapsed, mainly because of his own "planning pit", and the largest "puzzle" is no more than three articles: "tiger snake tail," "self-eating its fruits" and "broader than lawgiver."
Canada's most authoritative Angus-Rayd poll shows that since 2015, respondents who supported Trudeau have slipped from more than 60% to more than 30%, while opponents have soared from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Despite the equally poor performance of other opposition parties and their leaders, even a significant number of voters who still want to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now dismayed by the federal prime minister and ruling party leader.
On October 21, a new federal legislative election in Canada is about to begin and Trudeau can replay the full-fledged play five years ago?
The answer may be one word: Hard.
Whether from the corporate competition level, consumer experience level, or from regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tsingjin-Hebei development integration level, there are far-reaching impact and positive significance.
On September 25, Beijing Daxing International Airport officially opened.
Xinjing News reporter from the Beijing City Development and Reform Commission learned that the capital airport has been in supersaturated operation state, Daxing International Airport opening will improve the ability of the capital aviation service.
After Shanghai, Beijing has become the second city with two airports in China, as Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic aviation affairs, Pudong airport is based on international shipping aviation, and the future capital and Daxing airport will also serve national and international different air operations differentiated positioning, providing more segmented services.
Daxing airport, from the point of view of business development, is more favorable for the capital airport.
The capital airport in 2018 passenger throughput exceeded 100 million times, ranking first in the country, but compared with fast-growing business needs, there is still a clear lack of transport capacity, especially international routes demand has a large gap.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, travel and other needs, adapt to Beijing's increasingly open and international urban development trend, Daxing International Airport is positioned as a large international hub airport, plans to meet the annual passenger throughput of 100 million people, cargo throughput of 4 million tons.
Therefore, the two airports do not overlap, each targeting different customer groups, and also have sufficient market space.
From the economic accounting point of view, Daxing International Airport's air traffic will clearly form a win-win effect, ease Beijing Air Traffic Tension, speed up passenger and cargo throughput growth, and create an incremental cake for the dual nuclear operation of capital aviation.
From a user perspective, with Daxing International Airport navigating, the future does not have to be focused on capital airport travel, but can also reduce the number of problems caused by excessive concentration of routes, such as longer stop security time, slower passenger boarding speed, indirectly increase the flight and passengers stay at the airport, exacerbated the burden of operation of the airport, reduced shipping through the capital airport, in fact improves the passenger's travel experience.
According to the media's calculation of many transportation routes to large international airports, such as from the South Five Ring Road and directly to Daxing Airport high speed, driving 50 minutes can be reached, oil money comes back about 40 yuan, a high speed cost of 15 yuan; and choose the rail transport metro Daxing airport line, distance according to distance is 20 km, 30 km limit, ticket price divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three-stage; citizens can also take Beijing Zhongcheng Intercity, from Beijing West Station to Daxing Airport Station just more than 20 minutes.
Generally speaking, there are a variety of transportation options available for citizens to Daxing airport, and the cost and time is also within a reasonable range.
From the point of view of trend development: Daxing Airport is positioned as a Beijing-Tsingjin-Hebei transportation hub, so it is a little distance from Beijing city center, but strengthens radiation to Hebei, Tianjin, facilitates more people travel, which is important for driving the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, Hebei and Tianjin passengers can enjoy more international airline services provided by Daxing International Airport, which is visible from the transportation planning of Daxing International Airport.
In addition to the new airport line from Daxing Airport in Beijing, there are several highways connecting Daxing Airport and surrounding areas.
This is like the Guangdong Dongguan, Foshan, Qingyuan and other city passengers can go to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport through Guangfu, Guangdong and deep highways, as residents of Beijing's surrounding porch mill, Shioan Xin District and other places will benefit from Daxing airport, access to convenient and efficient air services.
From this, it can be seen that Daxing International Airport's air traffic not only adds a few runways and several aircraft, whether from the level of corporate competition, consumer experience, or from regional aviation integration, Beijing-Tsingjin-Hebei development integration, have far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only related to the long-term layout and development of the Beijing shipping industry, provide diverse options for the travel of the majority of residents of Beijing-Tsingjin-Hebei, promote the further improvement of the quality of service in the Beijing shipping industry, more conducive to promoting the integrated development process of Beijing-Tsingjin-Hebei, stimulate economic and trade development in the surrounding areas of Daxing airport.
Therefore, for the navigation of Daxing airport, we should not only account for individual small accounts in economic terms, but also for the overall development of large accounts.

The 2019 Vietnam Economic and Social Forum was held in the province of Chengtianshuniz
Nguyen, Deputy Director of the Economic Commission of the Congress of Vietnam, revealed that at the beginning of this year, the economic and social development of Vietnam showed many new blooms and continued to maintain a growth trend.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the first few months of 2019, proposing measures for economic and social development in late 2019 and 2020.
During the forum, participants exchanged views and opinions on four topics such as economic development in 2019 and the impact of some free-trade agreements, a number of prominent issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnamese social culture in 2019, and forecasts and recommendations for Viet Nam's economic and social development in 2020.
In the first few months of 2019, global economic growth slowed and risks and challenges increased.
Trade frictions between major economies have further crippled global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that despite the global economy's uncertainty, of which 70% of the world's economies are stuck in growth stagnation, Vietnam's economic development still has many promising achievements, smooth macroeconomic operation and effective control of inflation, with an average increase of 2.64% in the first half of 2019, the lowest rate in nearly three years.
GDP growth of 6.76% in the first half of 2019, down from 7.05% in the same period last year, is still higher than at the same level during the 2011-2017 phase.
When forecasting the trends in Vietnam's economic development in 2019-2020, Deng Deying, deputy director of the National Center for Economic and Social Forecasting in Vietnam, said that in the context of world economic turbulence, the Vietnamese economy showed a high growth momentum in 2019.
It is expected that by 2020, the macroeconomics of Vietnam will continue to be basically stable, implementation of self-trade agreements will contribute to trade development, economic restructuring and business environment improvement work has been further strengthened, as a result of trade frictions, Vietnam's foreign export activity will show a downward trend.
It is therefore necessary to strengthen the monitoring and forecasting early warning mechanism, proactively seek trade relief measures targeting Vietnamese exports, find opportunities for expanding new export markets, and create an environment conducive to foreign exports of various commodities such as agro-water products.
At the same time, to control inflation at a reasonable level, this promotes the development of auxiliary industries and supports the development of high-tech agriculture, organic farming and eco-agriculture.
Liu Zhijie, director of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia's Consulate Office in Siem Reap, held a reception at Siem Reap on 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
Liu Zhijie said that for 70 years since the founding of New China, China has actively participated in international affairs, contributed more Chinese wisdom and Chinese programs to improve global economic governance and promote global common development, made important contributions to world peace and development, and also brought real benefits to Cambodia's economic development and people's well-being.
Liu Zhijie said that as the world's second-largest economy, China's contribution to global economic growth is more than 30%, especially in China's Belt and Road Initiative, cooperation between various local provinces and cities of China with Siem Reap and territorial regions continues to deepen.
He said that this year is the beginning of 61 years of China-Cambodia diplomatic relations, with two countries having a brotherly friendship and friendship, and mutual benefit cooperation between Cambodia and Cambodia will be the driving force for local economic and social development.
The governor of Siem Reap Province, Disayha, praised the great achievements of New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the two countries for their friendship and cooperation.
Diesha expects the two sides to continue working together to promote friendship and cooperation between China and Cambodia, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and continuously improve the living standards of the people.
Disayha said that the friendly exchanges between Siem Reap Province and China's provinces and cities are striking, so far concluded friendship relations with 28 provinces and cities of China, large-scale cultural performance projects Angkor Smile and Angkor Dynasty lands, Siem Reap - Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, Siem Reap New International Airport project, special training courses for government officials in Siem Reap province, study scholarships for students from Siem Reap to China, village counseling, promotion and reform of urban roads, Baitantra rehabilitation public benefit project "Light Road", etc. Cooperation has been fruitful, In Cambodian Friendship and cooperation, the people of Siem Reap have become direct beneficiaries.
The State Secretary of the Ministry of Defence of Cambodia, Ken Wensong, Chairman of the Siem Reap Provincial Council Heung, five governors of the territorial area, and the Camboo-Chinese Council's Siem Reap Branch, volunteer teachers, the Sino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, representatives of Chinese enterprises and representatives of foreign consulates in Siem Reap attended the reception.
In the cloudy town to witness a decade of digital China's "cloud rise" - Xinhua Net
If the 2009 local website forum is used as a starting point, the 2019 cloud-based conference held in Hangzhou from 25 to 27 has taken place for a whole decade.
From the concept of "cloud fog" to the practice of "cloud", big data, cloud computing in 10 years has become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management and public services.
In the Tianjin New Energy Photovoltaic Battery Workshop in Haining, Zhejiang, a new "collaborator" with Aliyun artificial intelligence has recently been installed next to the quality inspectors.
It is 24 hours unstoppable, the identification speed is more than twice as fast as manual, and the quality test accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's head, the "quality inspector" with a camera has concentrated on learning more than 40,000 flawless samples, thanks to the cloud computing power behind it can quickly convert infrared images into binary languages, and classify flawless batteries.
The company is just a shortcut for today's cloud computing to help transform the manufacturing industry.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a Guide to Promoting Enterprise Cloud Implementation (2018-2020), which proposes that by 2020, we strive to achieve an obvious improvement in enterprise cloud awareness and enthusiasm, with a significant increase in the proportion and depth of applications.
Ali Cloud founder Wang Jin said today, data-centric cloud computing has built a bridge to the digital economy of data as key elements and paved the way.
At the same time, for 10 years, China's cloud computing industry has been expanding.
China Information and Communications Research Institute released in July this year's White Paper on Cloud Development (2019) shows that the overall market size of China's cloud computing has reached 96.28 billion yuan in 2018, an increase of 39.2% over 2017.
In addition to being a key technology that supports industrial transformation and digital economic development, invisible "clouds" are also unknowingly changing urban management and social life.
This year's cloud-based conference, the "urban brain" that appeared for three consecutive years still attracts attention.
According to Ali Cloud, the current urban brain has become a hub of urban management from transportation governance tools, and related collaborative applications have expanded to 23 cities around the world.
Through camera perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, the city's brain through powerful computing capabilities enables new urban management services such as "parking and paying first," "visitor numbers in real time" and "tourist route design".
In the field of government services, using a "one cloud" to match "one thing", and promoting "top-to-top office" and "top-to-top business", cloud computing has brought convenience to both ends of the supply of government services.
Currently, Zhejiang has built a unified public data platform across the province through the government cloud.
As of September 11, the platform has covered more than 57 million permanent residents and more than 15 million legal entities in the province, collecting 19.08 billion data on governance for 3066 categories.
The average monthly number of calls and shared data in Zhejiang province has reached 12 million times, and every time more calls are flowing on the "cloud", which may mean that people do less work.
Cleaning tea with plastic bags!
According to the Central News Agency, a recent study in Canada found that a package of plastic tea bags could release billions or even billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than a person's estimated amount of microplastics consumed throughout the year, but so far there is no evidence that it poses a threat to humans.
Researchers at McGill University in Canada found that immersing plastic tea bags into a cup of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius) would release about 11.6 billion plastic particles and 3.1 billion smaller nanoplastic particles to the cup.
This number is significantly higher than the amount of microplastics consumed by a person throughout the year.
According to earlier research published in 2019, people eat at least 50,000 plastic particles a year while inhaling the same amount of microplastics.
The study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology, where researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags at Montreal stores and cafes, opened them, immersed them in almost boiling water for five minutes after washing them, and analyzed them using electronic microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag released more than 11.6 billion plastic particles, "a few levels higher than previous other foods."
Most tea bags are made of natural fibers, but many brands still use plastic to seal them.
Some brands of tea bags are no longer paper-based and instead use plastics, which are precisely the subjects that researchers test.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastics, and the researchers defined these microplastics in size ranging from 100 nanometers to 5 cubic meters, mainly produced by decomposition of plastic waste.
The researchers found traces of plastic particles in the air, soil, rivers and deepest trenches around the world, which can also be found in tap water, bottled water, seafood and beer.
In October 2018, the researchers first discovered plastic particles in human fecal samples from several countries across different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released by tea bags, the Canadian team put fleas in polluted water and found that microplastics affect the behavior of these fleas and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been no evidence so far that plastic pellets can pose a threat to humans.
However, the WHO notes that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impacts they have on humans.
The researchers speculate that these tea bags release a large amount of plastic particles, possibly in contact with boiling water, and even when "eating grade" plastics are heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius, they can decompose or seep out toxic substances.
Guterres said the climate emergency is the biggest threat to the survival of small island nations.
There, a natural disaster would erode the development gains of a generation.
This is illustrated by the disasters in Papua, Dominica and the Bahamas that have been hit by hurricanes since this year.
About a quarter of the population in small island developing States lives at altitudes 5 meters or less.
Relocation can seriously affect their societies and lifestyles, even triggering issues of sovereignty and national identity.
At this Monday's Climate Action Summit, small island nations are working together to achieve carbon-neutral and 100% renewable energy by 2030, leading the world in the right direction again.
"The climate crisis is accumulating new injustices over the old ones."
Despite the small contribution of small island developing States to global warming, it pays the highest price.
Due to their middle-income status, many countries are also trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of disasters and debt.
The world must take action, and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing States."
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risk, invest in climate-responsive infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; urging international institutions to assist small island developing States, particularly the heavily indebted middle-income countries, in accessing financing.
Small island developing States are at the forefront of protecting and conserving the lifeline of the Earth - the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have been suffering from the "surrounded" consequences of the climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, some extreme sea-level rises that would have occurred in many regions could occur every year.
The report warns that some island countries are likely to become uninhabitable without significant investment in adaptation.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification caused huge losses.
The world has lost half of all living corals in the past 150 years, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold over the last 40 years.
Demands for industrial, shipping, mining and tourism are leading to reduced resources, including the maintenance of fishing grounds in many island communities.
Small island States are also facing high costs of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They rely heavily on some external markets, making them subject to price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security impact of illicit trafficking in persons, weapons and drugs.
"By solving a problem in the most challenging environment, it can be solved anywhere."
The efforts of small island developing States to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned and examples that can be drawn from all over the world."
He stressed that small island developing States were a unique example of sustainable development.
They require long-term attention and investment from the international community as a whole.
India's Ministry of Finance says the financial system is well-flown.
Indian Finance Minister Sitaraman said on 26 that the current financial system is well-flowing and, driven by holiday consumption demand, India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year.
Citaraman made the statement following a meeting with representatives of private banks, non-banking financial institutions and housing banks in India.
Sitaraman did not specify the targetedness of these remarks.
Some of the earlier Indian and overseas media blamed India's ongoing slowdown on liquidity tensions among non-banking financial institutions.
Citaraman cited a drop in car sales as an example, denying that liquidity tensions are the main reason for the downturn.
Citaraman noted that the decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors.
Citaraman expects that, driven by holiday spending, India's economic growth may recover in the second half of fiscal year.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and will last until the end of the year.
The market expects that shopping consumption will significantly boost India's economic growth.

"Over-age migrant workers on some sites are estimated to account for more than half of them.
Where are the young workers now?
There is no way to use so many "old people" on the site.
Recently, for the phenomenon of many overage migrant workers (over retirement age) on the site, Zou Qui, a long-term engineering contractor in the construction industry, lamented.
Recently, the high school of the author carried out rain and sludge project, there were many migrant workers on the campus, if you look carefully, you will find a lot of overage migrant workers here.
Over-age migrant workers are not "lacking," but because they can't stay, and have the "need to do so" helplessness and hardship - whether it is saving money to solve their own pension and medical problems or helping their children - drive these old people who should have been "lackening up" to continue working hard.
"Old-age" migrant workers are not as easy as we can imagine.
Nursing children, supporting the elderly, for children to read books, helping children build buildings to buy cars, helping children become domestic workers, and rearing grandchildren after generation, when these migrant workers have completed "life tasks", money bags have been empty or even a lot of debts, most of which lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to drag children and save themselves a lot of wealth, many migrant workers insist on "doing until it is inactive."
Many "after 80", "after 90" or even "after 00" new generation migrant workers are unwilling to engage in difficult conditions, high labor intensity of secondary industry or low-end service industries, resulting in a structural "laundry of employment", these lack of attractive jobs provide opportunities for ultra-age migrant workers.
Due to the lack of a long skill, physical ability and labor capacity has decreased again, many overage migrant workers do work with high strength, low income, high risk, low security.
Can do a day is a day, can make a little more than a point, "can't idle" behind the survivability of migrant workers, can not be ignored and ignored.
Resolving the problem of arrears and wage difficulties, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor income, improve the survival status of overage migrant workers, in addition to their "self-relief", is also inseparable from the public sector's system of care and humanistic care.
Some scholars have pointed out that overage migrant workers are less likely to rely on home-grown land to solve their own problems such as pension and medical care, and they must feed their families by other means.
Reading the helplessness and strength of ultra-age migrant workers "cannot idle", helps us to better understand the love and pain of super-aged migrant workers.
Seeing the backdrop of over-age migrant workers, hearing their sighs, trying to find ways to get them back into the countryside to truly achieve "old reliance", requires the public sector, markets and society to share responsibility in a virtuous interaction, needs multiple combinations.
Chemezov said Russia will not export this system in the next five years, because "the first is to supply its own army and then it will be exported".
This approach is in full conformity with international practice.
The main producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their national defence needs first, before processing export orders.
Earlier, Russian Deputy Commander-in-Chief General Yuri Grekhov said the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by the "Golden-Antai" air defense Kantsen.
This is a new generation of air defense systems that employ the working methods for destroying ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept intermediate-range ballistic missiles that can intercept missiles with a range of less than 3,500 kilometers.
In addition, according to some information, the S-500 can destroy hypersonic cruise missiles as well as aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, hypersonic missiles more than 5 times faster than sound speed, and even targets located near space.
This weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other anti-aircraft systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important in terms of defense.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system currently has a lot of demand in the world, but Russian troops also need it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 air defense system is in service with the Arctic Air Defense Corps.
According to the news of September 15, work on the modification of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the Arctic air defense regiment in New Delhi has been completed.
This is not the militarization of Russia in the Arctic region.
The Russian Defense Ministry said it was entirely a process within the transition plan for more advanced defensive tools to the strategic direction of the north.
Russia's Northern Fleet news agency said: "With the transition to a new S-400 air defense system, the controlled airspace in the Arctic region has grown significantly."
Very important, according to military assessments, the system has been successfully used in both North and Arctic regions.
The air defense regiments trained the new system and prepared for entry into combat duty stations.
Previously it was equipped with the S-300 long-range air defense system, which is still retained in part.
As for the air defense system, it must have weapons capable of destroying various aerial targets, whether they are external high-altitude flights or "fish leaks" close to protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system developed by "Golden Diamonds-Antai" Aerospace Defense Concein was designed for attacking strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, hypersonic targets and other aerial assault weapons.
This weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within a range of 400 kilometers and shoot down ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometers per second over a distance of 60 kilometers.
Russia never conceals its additional deployment of air defense forces in the far North region to ensure the security of airspace on the Northern Sea Route.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic region, which was enough to form an air defense battalion and strengthen the air defense system in the Arctic region.
Russian Defense Ministry said that the Arctic "Tor" forces will be expanded to complete brigade-level formation in the future.
Together with the new S-400 remote systems deployed on New Geos and Cora Peninsula, as well as the Pantsir - SA short-range systems deployed in the North Pole, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons are powerfully defending Russia's polar sky.
The enemy's aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will be difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government's idea, flagship stores will become a platform for Russian manufacturers to place goods and avoid their own complex and lengthy process of opening shops.
The company, which operates as a Russian grocery store, is focused on selling Russian goods in China.
Russia's largest trading platforms such as Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, Hand Q (ShouQ), Multi-functional instant messaging software Wechat have online stores and own their own online platform Epinduo.com and Russian merchandise retail chains.
The Russian Export Center will work with Russia to develop shop marketing strategies and participating standards, and sift virtual shelves on product companies.
The store plans to open and install at least 10 Russian manufacturers by the end of this year.
According to data from the Russian Export Center, the total monthly visits of China's e-commerce platform are as high as 1 billion.
At the same time, food exports to China have been showing steady growth since 2014, with more than $1 billion in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open pilot stores within the global import strategy to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.
According to Alexey Kozevnikov, the new store will display goods for enterprises with sales of at least 500 million rubles.
To be honest, my expectations are higher and sales of 500 million rubles are not enough.
We all know that the attitude of Chinese consumers towards Russian goods is quite positive, considering our products as high-quality and green environmental protection products."
Kozhevnikov said the competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power was fierce and escalating.
"Our goal is ambitious, and 500 businesses will be launched through this store in three years," he said.
At the same time, the platform will also carry on the products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.
Vyacheslav Cheglov, Professor of the Basic School of Trade Policy at the Economic University of Plekhanov in Russia, said: "This is a political project that represents both sides because Russian export centers are state-owned rather than private institutions."
"I have not seen a large number of highly competitive Russian goods on the market."
He believes the project is likely not to be really implemented, but it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
Andrei Slepnev, president of the Russian export center, said during the Eastern Economic Forum that product information from more than 170 Russian enterprises has been published on Alibaba.com, the largest international wholesale online platform, which can be purchased in China or other countries.
In addition, there is also a model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely the training project for Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
In November this year, at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai, Russia's Export Center will also act as an organizer of Russian enterprises to participate in industry exhibitions and commercial projects.
Large exhibitions will be held in the 1000 square meters exhibition hall, which will also serve as a center for commercial project events, signing ceremonies, promotional meetings and talks with Chinese corporate representatives.
About 50 applications from Russian agribusinesses have been received.
Russia's Export Center news agency said: "In addition to the agricultural stands, we will also have business meetings that arrang for direct linkages between entrepreneurs."
"This is another direction of our efforts, with the aim of supporting businesses and ensuring that dozens of special meetings are organized for them."
In addition, the exhibition will also host a masterclass, cooking contest and "Exploring Russian cuisine at Shanghai Station" program for famous Russian chefs to cook in Russia.

New Year's Day: Resolutely not to go our own way.
The white paper "China and the World in the New Era" released on 27th: China's development has been successful for 70 years, mainly because under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have found the right way to develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and have walked along this path unwaveringly.
China's path to its own development is the choice of history and people.
In recent times, in the environment of poverty and weakness, internal distress and external problems, a generation of benefactors seek to find the way to rescue the country and its people.
However, "the constitutional monarchy, the re-establishment of imperialism, parliamentary system, multiparty system, and presidential system have been thought about and tried, and the results are not working."
Only with the Communist Party of China and new China, the Chinese people gradually opened a socialist path with Chinese characteristics in practice.
China's way out is the road of happiness for the Chinese people, the path of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as the co-development of China and all countries around the world.
It is precisely because on the right path that China can do its own things, to become the world's second-largest economy and the largest contributor to global economic growth, it can continue to benefit the world with its own development.
As pointed out in the White Paper, China's development path, consistent with Chinese national conditions and adapting to the requirements of the era, will increasingly show bright prospects for development as time progresses.
Looking back on the past, the Chinese people know how difficult it is to find a right path; looking around the world, the Chinese people are more cherished for this right path.
The Chinese people know the rationale of South Orange North Pole, understand that suitable for others is not necessarily suitable for themselves, only suitable for their own are the best.
With this path of self-confidence and strategic determination, China has created world-famous miracles.
In the twisting process of human progress, "the final conclusion of history" has been famous for a while.
Today, the success of the socialist path with Chinese characteristics declares the end of the "final conclusion of history", the collapse of the "Chinese crumble theory" and the failure of the "socialist failure theory".
China's success has galvanized the confidence of developing countries in achieving rich and prosperous people, broadened the path of developing countries to modernity, provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate development and want to maintain their independence.
The world is colourful.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose a path that suits their own national circumstances.
China will not "input" foreign model, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will firmly pursue its own path, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen governance exchanges with countries, make due contribution to the common realization of good governance and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that a foodworks supermarket owner fired a 66-year-old female worker by texting because he preferred to hire employees from Asian backgrounds, the boss's practice being lashed out as "disgraceful."
The committee said Ms. Gail Ayton's boss, Jianbin Wang, who worked in the Wagga Wagga store for more than 20 years, treated employees "very unfairly" and could violate anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the Committee that Mr. Wang took over the store in 2016 and he had always "wanted to fire me" because she wasn't Chinese.
In this case, Peter Sams, Vice Chairman of the Committee, conducted a search on the Internet to find "some recruiting advertisements that Mr. Wang has published in various Australian Chinese employment forums."
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said "preferably Asian ladies" and the other said "preferably Asian employees".
The third post says he "prefers to overseas people."
Mr. Wang fired Ms. Ayton by texting in April this year, later saying it was due to her absenteeism and the alleged lack of a small amount of cash from $5.10 to $30 on the banker.
However, Mr. Sams said that the reason for Mr. Wang's dismissal of Ms. Ayton was weak and lacked evidence.
For three years, she had only been absent for one class, and the "lost amount" totaled a few Australian dollars.
He said Ms. Ayton's dismissal was "in fact unrelated to her behavior or performance."
"In my opinion, with the evidence of Mr. Wang's recruitment ads being released, the real motivation to dismiss her is that he prefers to hire employees from Asian backgrounds."
According to article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's actions appear to constitute a violation of anti-discrimination law and/or dismissal of the applicant is illegal."
Mr. Sams said that, given Mr. Wang's "horrific" treatment of Ms. Ayton, it was not appropriate to consider resuming her position.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms. Ayton, who was a temporary worker with an hourly salary of AUD 26.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams said he would submit his rulings and documents to the commission's head in order to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be forwarded to other bodies to investigate possible breaches of state or federal law.
He said that Mr. Wang had not given Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged grounds for her dismissal.
"I think that the defender should take irreparable unfair and biased procedures to dismiss the applicant, Mr. Wang "waits" this opportunity, which he believes will 'prove' it is justified to terminate employment with the applicant."
"He's wrong... that the defender should completely ignore any natural and just treatment given to her in dismissal of the applicant, shockingly, his dishonest and extremely unfair reproach."
Mr. Sams said that while Foodworks is a small business, "But it must be frankly clear that no decent employer will fire employees in an extremely unfair and manipulative manner recognized in this case."
"It's shameful and extremely unfair," he said.

6 people denied the sale of pseudo-Damaka newspaper paper case before the Supreme Court
Six men suspected of falsifying and selling our passports, paperwork and identity cards, including an assistant director of the State Registration Bureau, as well as a lawyer-in-law businessman, passed on Thursday's case to the court where the judge approved allegations concerning anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking migrants for transfer to the High Court.
The defense lawyer, who originally represented the Chinese-American defendant Li Zhenhua (translation), was also a member of the parliament in Sunset Cave District Reil, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of this case, that is not to become the representative lawyer of the accused, and the court was approved.
He said he himself had been criticised by political opponents for representing the accused, and his party of action was also involved.
He stressed that he was not afraid of any threat in his own right, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to denigrate the Action Party and the ISLA Government or other ISLA leaders, so this decision was taken after careful consideration.
He also said that there was no conflict of interest between the accused and his capacity as a member of Congress, and that he had not been legally barred from representing any of the accused.
The six defendants were charged to the court on September 12 this year, facing a number of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration decree provisions 26E, as well as article 466 of the Criminal Code (falsification of documents), all denied guilt and did not receive an extrajudicial trial from the court.
On Thursday, two court judges Noshaha and Mazland approved the prosecution &apos; s application after statements made by both sides to refer the six defendants &apos; allegations of anti-trafficking and anti-trafficking immigration laws to the High Court. The charges for counterfeiting documents will be held on Oct. 3 in a courtroom waiting for the prosecution to hand them over to the defence.
The previous six defendants were arrested under the National Security Crimes (Special Measures) Act 2012 (SOSMA), so judges did not grant bail.

Honors of military personnel come from hard training.
As a sweeping light of the flag handler, training has been high standards and strict requirements.
He tied the sandbag to practice stereotyping, stuck with a second watch to practice pace, blinded by his eyes to practice pace and stability.
In his career, a picture is always unforgettable.
There was a flag rise ceremony, and the rain fell down, while none of the tourists who came to see the flag ascending ceremony left.
At the moment when the flag rose, Qi Xiaoguang felt the glory of the five starred red flags on this shoulder.
In 2019, Qi Xiaoguang was selected as a benchmark soldier.
The benchmark soldier and the standard of operation of the flagpole are different.
Qi Xiaoguang introduced that the progress of the footmen and benchmark soldiers, although only more than 20 steps away, training needs to make more effort.
The benchmark soldier is the first position, which directly determines the level of neatness of each team.
After intensive training in the parade, he repeatedly kicked his legs every day and practiced a hard work.
In the demonstration demonstration, his precise pace and speed won applause by officers and soldiers.
In the team, almost every officer and soldier has the same experience with Qi Xiaoguang.

Vietnam needs to seize the opportunity of artificial intelligence development.
Four criteria used to assess and rank cities in the face of AI wave readiness levels include prospects, implementation capabilities, asset base and development direction.
Singapore is ranked number one, followed by cities in the UK, USA, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an expert at the organization, said in an interview with Mosin Bavanne: "I feel very meaningful when reviewing and evaluating cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam.
Overall, I think the future of Vietnam is bright in the context of high growth rates, strong economic development paths and rapid development of talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and doing well.
Importantly, Vietnam should know how to take advantage of the opportunities brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution to boost economic growth.
Artificial intelligence is completely transforming people's work, communication and lifestyle.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat to exacerbate social, economic and technological inequalities.
However, according to a global study organized by Oliver Wyman, there are only one city in the world today ready for the breakthroughs brought about by the era of artificial intelligence.

In the year, listed companies repurchased more than 100 billion yuan to create a history of high-tech - Xinhua network
In order to stabilize the company's stock price and maintain the image of the company, listed companies began frequent repurchases of shares in recent two years, through targeted repurchases, collection of competitive bidding transactions, etc., hope to transfer the company's value undervalued this information to the market, thereby stabilizing the share price and enhancing investor confidence.
Eastern Fortune Choice data shows that in 2017, the funds of listed companies for repurchase shares amounted to 7.9 billion yuan, in 2018 it surged to 51 billion yuan, since 2019, the total amount of repurchases implemented by listed companies A has exceeded 100 billion yuan, creating a new high in the number of back-purchase funds held by A shares, and far surpassing previous years.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the company's buyback shares appear to be the same as large shareholders, but there are significant differences in the implementation subjects, sources of funds, repurchase purposes, and equity interests of the stock itself.
Xu Yang, Chairman of Shanghai Meikorong Information Consulting Co., Ltd. in an interview with the Securities Daily reporter, said that in November 2018 issued "The Opinion on Supporting Repurchases of Shares by Listed Companies", for the narrow scope of repurchases of shares, complex decision-making procedures, and inadequate inventory system problems of existing systems have been repaired, because previously from the policy side began to encourage listed companies to buy back shares, so the phenomenon of repurchases of shares in this year greatly increased.
In January this year, the company and Deep Trading Company officially issued the "Executive Rules for Repurchase of Shares by Listed Companies", these policies have broadened the sources of repurchase funds from listed companies, appropriately simplified implementation procedures, guided and improved governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee ownership plans.
After the submission of the opinion, the operation of stock buyback by listed companies has more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is easier, and the enthusiasm for share buyback is greater.
Repurchase shares in a relatively low location also helps listed companies to improve the efficiency of use of funds, thereby increasing the level of profitability per share, improving net asset yields, and reducing the pressure on corporate profit indicators.
Compared to larger shareholders, the repurchase of shares by listed companies is more meaningful, and it also reflects the willingness of listed companies to actively manage market capitalization and cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that the stock price is undervalued as the main factor of repurchase by listed companies, the company's stock price has not been able to reflect the future development prospects of the company, so such companies are worth the attention of investors, but can not blindly invest, need to pay attention to the financial statements and specific operations of such listed companies.
Public companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate the company's development confidence and financial strength.
A stock listed company repurchase enthusiasm gradually warmed up, and also normalized the buyback behavior, data shows that there have been nearly thousands of listed companies implementing shares repurchase this year, and the leading companies in various industries become the main force of the buyback market.
China's recent disclosure of repurchase progress said that the company has accumulated 57.59 million shares of A share through centralized competitive trading methods, accounting for 0.315% of the company's total share capital, a total of 5 billion yuan (excluding transaction costs) have been paid, and all return shares will be used for employee ownership plans, including but not limited to long-term service plans considered by the Company's shareholders meeting.
Illi shares have paid 5,792 million yuan for repurchases of shares and recently adjusted the use of repurchases to change from the original plan "repurchased shares will be used as a source of later implementation of equity incentives" to "accumulative repurchases of 183 million shares, of which 152 million shares will be used in order to implement equity incentives, remaining 30.49 million shares will be written off to reduce registered capital."
Erie shares said that the cancellation of some repurchased shares would help to further improve the level of earnings per share and effectively increase the return on investment for shareholders.
TCL Group released the repurchase progress announcement on September 25 shows that TCL Group has cumulatively repurchased 3.59% of its shares, which cost a total of 1.65 billion yuan.
The TCL Group Board of Directors' Office told Securities Journal reporters that repurchased shares would be used for employee ownership plans, equity incentives or corporate bonds to convert stock-to-equity issued by listed companies.
TCL Group adheres to the established business strategy, continuously improves competitiveness and sustainable healthy development.
Based on the confidence in the future development of the company and the preservation of investor interests, combined with the performance of the second-tier market for the company's shares over the past year, and taking into account factors such as the business situation and financial situation of the company, the company plans to use its own funds, self-financing and other financing methods to repurchase the company's shares.
Yang Delong, the chief economist of the former Hai Open Source Fund, said that on the one hand, the action of listed companies to buy back shares can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market, increase the earnings per share of listed companies, is an important benefit for the secondary market stock price; and on the other hand, listed companies are willing to proactively withdraw real gold and silver from the stock market to buy back or write off shares, which greatly boosted market confidence.
Repurchases of domestic listed companies have gradually increased in recent years, especially performance shares, through share repurchases to boost investor confidence is a very good way and also worth affirming and encouraging practice.
Hunan Provincial Standing Committee and Changsha Municipal Committee Secretary Hu Henghua and Engineering Machinery Manufacturing Xiangyang four main masters - Jian Quinxin, Liang Shengcheng, Ho Chianghua, Liu Fengxiang, set a "small target" around Changsha from Engineering Machinery to Intelligent Manufacturing - three or five years later to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster.
In Changsha to build the world's leading level of engineering machinery industry cluster, in today's fashionable words, is to create "the strongest surface".
As an inland provincial capital city, Changsha shouted this boastful speech, and what was the bottom line?
It is the power of gushing on the side.
The four engineering machinery companies participating in the dialogue, each hand is achieved, covering the whole field of heaven, underground, sea and land: mountain river intelligent light aircraft, cement conveyor pump for MCC, all-terrain cranes for 31 heavy work, tunnel shielding machines for iron construction.
Once upon a time, China basically has no right to speak in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
China's enterprises "introduced" "going out" two-wheel drive, take the "One Belt and One Road" initiative of the east wind, acquisition, merger, installation and so on, leap into the global engineering machinery industry.
Among them, three-first heavy labor, Sino-United Heavy Industries, iron construction heavy labor, mountain river intelligent engineering machinery leading enterprises, its output value, market share, sales and other major economic indicators, has been a significant leader of similar enterprises.
The camera steered by the current position.
"Four Jingang" is the leader of Changsha Engineering Machinery Industry Cluster, and also the head enterprise of the global engineering machinery industry.
In the rivers of global industry, who survives and lives well is the hardest to speak.
In the early years, the global engineering machinery industry has experienced a cold winter, many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises have fallen down, but Changsha's engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises put "cat winter" as "winter swimming", self-pressure, self-breakthrough, through the transformation of industrial structure, from manufacturing to intellectual creation, not only stood up for the past, but also stronger body bones.
It is the moon of the stars that are swayed by them.
Development of the advantageous industries requires both enterprise proactiveness and government active action.
Changsha's reputation for "the capital of engineering machinery" is that it brings together the entire industry chain from upstream to downstream, builds a number of related industrial clusters, and by optimizing the business environment, improving supporting services, simplifying the approval process and other deregulation initiatives, the company's R&D, manufacturing and sales costs are greatly reduced.
Good business ecology, so that the engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises are dispersed.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of building a global level of engineering machinery, and I can't do it.
Whether it is the government, or enterprises, and even related to production research and development, etc., should seize opportunities, push forward, bite targets, continue to make a strong contribution to the construction and manufacturing of Hunan forces.

The African side applauds China as a permanent member of the Security Council for its important and positive role in African affairs, which has vigorously promoted a just and rational solution to Africa &apos; s problems and made great efforts and contributions to safeguarding Africa &apos; s interests and promoting peace and security in Africa.
The current threat of terrorism and extremism confronts Africa, and only by resolving security problems can Africa truly achieve long-term peaceful development.
We look forward to further coordinating our position with China in the Security Council and strengthening solidarity and cooperation.
Wang Yi said that today's meeting reached an important consensus.
We all support the maintenance of multilateralism, strengthening the authority and role of the United Nations, upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, countering unilateralism and bullying; we all agree to strengthen China-Africa mutual support and cooperation in the affairs of the United Nations and the Security Council, safeguarding the common interests of Central Africa and the developing countries as a whole; we all support African countries in their efforts to resolve problems in Africa in an African manner and ask the United Nations to provide financial support for independent peace operations in Africa; we all support the concept of "cooperation for development, development for peace", helping African countries achieve self-sustainable development; we all firmly defend the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, oppose any country creating obstacles and depriving them of the right to develop.

"It's good to eat, until the autumn and winter are full of wellness, in order to sell a good price."
Sheavily said he fed the sheep every day "special nutrition meals", regularly cleaned, sterilized and carefully scrutinized.
She kept her sheep for more than 20 years, and it wasn't until the co-operatives worked that they knew how thick she was in the past.
Shavili is a summer and humpback village in the town of Qingyang City, Gansu Province.
His left-right neighbor is a sheep feeder, but adhere to the traditional method of dispersal, poor quality of sheep, small number of fences.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined cooperatives and everything began to change.
She spent the whole day digging and cultivating, because he kept a hard time in his heart.
Those in the stock are poor households, they all host sheep to cooperatives, at the end of the year can be diluted, sold and priced, but everyone counts on him.
Well, with the guidance of technical personnel, he slowly learned to prevent epidemics, mastered scientific feeding, became a few breeding in the village.
The pro-aquaculture professional cooperative is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep houses and has nearly 1,400 lakes and sheep.
The co-operative head Zou Tao said that the standardized sheep shed inside and outside, there are many doorways.
"The wool is thick, prone to germs, the lake and sheep can not be kept in dull and wet places, the sheep's shed must be built in three sides of the ditches, but also have to be fitted with a wind turbine to ventilate and heat."
Zou Tao said that in order to prevent epidemics, it is also necessary to regularly spray the sheep's shed and give the sheep three to four anti-pestilence needles in the first quarter.
In addition to living well, the "little fat sheep" must eat herbs mixed with green corn, wheatgrass, alfalfa and so on, and have a wide enough "field" to stretch the ligament bones.
The cooperative adopts a managed replacement approach, and guides local farmers to put benign species of lakes and sheep here, unified breeding, management, sales, realization of benign breeding, scientificization, standardization, intensive farming.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep in stock, each household is diluted by more than $6,000 a year, and four people working on poverty-reduction cards.
From "full mountain grazing" to "precision feeding", from "local mating" to "manual insemination", from "looking at the shape of the body, touching the stomach" to "by-by-by-B super".......In Gansu Qingyang, meat and sheep farming is not just a change in how to feed, but the model of "leading enterprises + cooperatives + farmers" has also changed the situation of once "sheep on the hillside, sell sheep in the market", overcome the weak and scattered traditional agricultural and pastoral industry, peasants' poor days due to modern shepherding.
Zou Tao said that if the market prices are weak, local leading enterprises Gansu Sino-Sheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd. will buy at a market protection price of 27 yuan per kg to help farmers disperse market risks.
Xu Jiafeng, General Advisor of Gansu Sinosheng Agricultural and Pastoral Development Co., Ltd., said that by providing loan guarantees for poor households, seeding supply, order farming, quotation acquisition, unified processing and sales services, enterprises are driving more and more poor households to read "sheep."
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor households achieved a steady increase in income by "joining" grass farming, well-cultivated breeding, scale farming, slaughtering division, market sales.
The city of Qingyang is located in the northern agricultural pasture cross-section, and grass resources are rich.
At present, there are 913 meat and sheep scale farming farms and cooperatives in the whole city, with more than 5 million meat and sheep raised, and two processing lines of 1.3 million slaughtered meat and sheep were built, and the flocks are becoming the "leader" of the country's industry for poverty alleviation.
France's finance minister said it would cut taxes more than a billion euros next year and called on Germany to follow suit
Reuters Paris, September 26 - French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Thursday that France would cut taxes by more than EUR10 billion (US$10.9 billion) next year and Germany should keep up with the pace of fiscal stimulus in France to rejuvenate its downturn economy.
Introducing France's 2020 budget, Lemer said the ECB's latest monetary easing initiative has created an opportunity for those able-bodied member governments to increase their investment.
The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates to record lows on September 12 and plans to restart purchases in order to lower borrowing costs, hoping to spur economic recovery and boost inflation.
"Low interest rates won't bring Europe back to prosper, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not enough," Lemer told reporters.
"The sooner Germany needs to invest, the sooner it will get better. Don't wait until the situation gets worse," he added.
He has repeatedly appealed to Germany for this.
France has introduced a tax cut of more than EUR10 billion this year, which has greatly boosted French economic growth.
The global economy is losing momentum and the German economy, which relies on exports, is at its top.
Lemer noted that the tax burden on French families will ease 9.3 billion euros next year, including EUR5 billion in income tax relief.
In addition, as corporate tax rates are gradually implemented from 33.3% to 25% over the five-year period, corporate tax burdens will be reduced by nearly EUR1 billion.

Study: Small growth in the U.S. National Healthy Diet Index but still a challenge - Xinhua
According to the U.S. Diaspora Network, a recent study in the United States shows that for 16 years, the government's health-care diet index has moderately increased from 56% to 58%.
But in the case of a full score of 100, this is not worth celebrating.
American nationals still face "significant challenges" in their diet.
Dr. Zhang Fanfang, a nutrition researcher at the University of Tafts in Massachusetts, said Americans still eat too much food that can cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity and other diseases, which are the most common diseases for American nationals.
The study was published on 24th in the Journal of American Medical Associations.
The study is based on a health survey conducted by the U.S. government in 1999-2016 of 44,000 adults.
The authors wrote, "Despite considerable improvement, significant dietary challenges still exist."
These challenges include reducing U.S. nationals' intake of saturated fat foods such as snacks, hot dogs, fertilized cows and butter.
The study found that the intake of these unhealthy fats in people's daily diet increased from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% intake limit.
The biggest improvement in the U.S. national diet is a drop in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but it's still too high.
The official believes that in daily diets, the intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
For the reasons for decreased intake of sugar, researchers believe it is associated with reduced consumption of sweet soda, but Zhang stressed that sugars are often added to even less sweet foods such as yogurt and tomato sauce.
U.S. adults have slightly increased their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole-grain foods.
However, data from 2016 show that these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Despite a slight decrease in salinity intake and reduced consumption of juice resulting in low-quality carbohydrates, Zhang said they still account for up to 42% of daily calories, many of which come from refined white bread and other refined cereals.
The study is based on a biannual personal health survey that will remind adults of what they've eaten in the last 24 hours.
These health surveys have been interrogating the issue twice every few days since 2003.
A government-issued U.S. population diet guide recommends that people adopt a "healthy diet model" to reduce the likelihood of developing chronic diseases.
The guide states that people should eat more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, seeds which can provide protein.
The number of people with diabetes in the U.S. almost doubled during the study, more than 7%, and obesity rates have increased for many years - now about 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease remains the main cause of death among U.S. nationals.
EU promotes strategic partnership with Asia
Nguyen Wenping, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, secretary of the Central Secretariat and Minister of Central Economy, attended the forum.
According to the close cooperation between the EU and its partners in Asia-Pacific, the theme of the forum was "Connection between the EU and Asia: Building Bridges for a Future of Sustainable Development".
The forum was held a year after the implementation of the junction strategy on both continents of the European Union.
Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the European Commission, said that enhanced cross-section is part of the above proposition as it brings benefits to the peoples and economies concerned.
The above-mentioned relationship helps to bring stability and prosperity to the parties concerned.
At the same time, he believes that the EU wants to convey a message about enhancing participation and consolidating the mutually beneficial relationship between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is an invited dignitary to the forum and will deliver important speeches at the plenary.
The country's first joint-stock management subsidiary was established to manage the business with science and technology.
On the 26th, Guangda Bank's wholly owned subsidiary Guangda Finance Co., Ltd. was officially established in Qingdao, which is China's first joint-stock banking finance subsidiary.
Experts say asset management is an important area for the development of fintech, and the establishment of a financial subsidiary by banks is conducive to its use of scientific and technological means to enhance their stewardship operations.
In April this year, Guang Da Bank and Merchant Bank issued a separate announcement that it has been approved by the Chinese Superintendent Board of Supervisors to build financial subsidiaries.
On September 24, the Guangda Bank announcement said that Guangda Finance has been officially allowed to open.
Shortly after 2 days, Guangqiao Bank led many joint-stock banks, and first established Guangqiao Finance in Qingdao.
Li Xiaoping, chairman of Guangda Group, said that Guangda Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, using modern scientific and technological thinking and means, relying on big data, Internet of Things, cloud computing, improve the coverage, utilization and penetration of financial capital, increase the customer's sense of access, happiness and security.
By 2021, establish and improve the development of China's financial science and technology "Four Lifts Eight Pillars", further strengthen the application capabilities of Fintech industry, achieve deep integration and coordinated development of finance and technology, significantly enhance the satisfaction of people to digital, networked, intelligent financial products and services.
Zhang Xuyang, Chairman of Guangda Financial Management Group, introduced that the HKMA financial management platform will use intelligent accounting, intelligent investment research, big data and other technologies to help Guangda Finance better perform macroeconomic situation judgment.
The future will also apply new technologies such as blockchain, grasping the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternatives.
Dong Shimiao, a special investigator at the National Institute for Finance and Development, said that in the new competition situation facing the custodian industry, fintech companies and custodians will explore new growth paths with custodian technology.
Fintech empowering the stewardship industry, as well as the need for financial technology's own transformation and development, will also inject new vitality and vitality into the development of the stewardship business.
Earlier this year, JD Digital Technology launched a new tertiary technology system to improve the product development and wind control capabilities of tertiary technology and digital means.
The new system starts with the four capabilities of product design, sales trading, asset management and risk assessment to improve the overall level of intelligent operation in the fintech industry.
Experts believe that while improving customer service capabilities, innovative and rich products, custodian technology can also enhance risk prevention capabilities and improve the efficiency of custodian management.
Zhang Xuyang said that in the past to locate customers' risk preferences through questionnaires is likely to be biased, and now using artificial intelligence for user images helps to better position customers, launch corresponding products according to their investment preferences, help to solve risks.
"Additional big data such as e-commerce, time and space data can help us to better map a region, an industry's activity and landscape."
Zhang Xuyang said that while mitigating risks, big data technology will also help improve wind control capabilities.
China's deepest track record of tunneling wells has been refreshed
27 September (Zhang Weiming Xu for China Zhou Jingbo) After more than 1,200 days of day-to-night construction, the construction of the railway tunnel No. 1 in Gao Ligong Hills Tunnel 1 was completed on 27th, and the well reached a depth of 762.59 meters below the ground, breaking the deepest record of Chinese railway tunnel laying, which was created in the case of massive flooding.
The 34.5 km long Grand Rui Railway Tunnel of Gaulingon Mountain is located in Yunnan, and the tunnel runs through the mountains of Gaulingon on the west bank of Angry River, which is Asia's longest double-wire single hole tunnel.
The tunnel traverses 19 break-necks with a maximum depth of 1,155 meters because it covers almost all possible adverse geological and significant risks to the construction of the tunnel, which is known as the "Geological Museum" for the construction of the tunnel.
The well is the most important auxiliary pit lane in the Galegon tunnel, shouldering an important task of increasing the operational surface to achieve "long tunnel shortcut" and later rail operation ventilation.
The 1st well was successfully dug to the bottom of the well, marking the official entrance into the horizontal tunnel construction of the Gaulingon mountain tunnel, and after the excavation and replacement of equipment in the basement can be added four operating surfaces under the well, accelerating the opening speed of the tunnel.
"The wells are all on the granite floor, because of the more cavities in the granite floor, can not stop water, from up to downstream continuously, basically how deep is the pressure of the well.
Zhangjiao, General Engineer of the Central and Iron Tunnel Bureau of the Great Russo Railway Project Department, told reporters that in the construction of the well, there have been numerous floods and landslides and other dangers, and the construction team invited experts to make a breakthrough on the site, more than 20 studies and treatment programs.
"When the maximum inflow of water within the well, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour, with a depth of more than 700 meters deep under the well, and the pressure is equivalent to a depth of 700 meters beneath the seafloor."
"If you don't pump the drain in time, one hour will drown 10 meters, we spend almost 85% of our time on water treatment and 15% of our time to dive."
In order to overcome geological problems such as scaffolding development of the 1st fence, flooding and rich water granite, tunnel construction uses a combination of "exploration, extraction and excavation" systemic water management measures to reduce the construction risk.
After several improvements, the construction of the 1st well formed a mechanized flow line such as excavation system, ballast system, suspension system, hoist lift system, and other, to achieve all-process mechanization operations such as eye impact, explosion, ballast, template installation, concrete watering, and so on, accelerating the construction progress.
Eventually, after more than 1200 days and nights of construction, the well successfully completed a 762.59 meters deep excavation.
The length of the Grand Rui Railway is 330 kilometers, which is an important part of the China-Myanmar International Passage and is an important transportation infrastructure for implementing the construction of the Belt and Road.
After the completion of the car, Dali to Riley's driving time will be 6 hours on the current road, shortened to 2 hours, will greatly improve the traffic pattern in the south-west region, and play a role in promoting economic and trade cooperation and personnel friendly relations between China and South-East Asian countries.

Look at the darya on the wall, just seven o'clock, sunrise country sunset too early, the sky has been darkened.
The circle of friends is in the invention of the moon, and today it is mid-Autumn.
Weaving a series of grapes sent by friends, leaving half to Boo, the rest in his favorite small flower bowl, end up looking out for the moon.
And Nana sat down on the ground, and I ate grapes she ate skins, and I again spit away the seeds of grapes with strength.
The moon is hidden in the cloud, so that the clouds are moving away, and the moon will appear unnoticed, with some piercing eyes.
In his head there were raging poems about the moon, and he liked it only clearly: every time three or five people circled/filled with a clean-cleaned jade fence/a round of sky to bring out.
Perhaps we have given too much emotion to the moon color, for now I say, in fact, that God's word belongs to God, Caesar's is best.
The color of the moon belongs to the colour of the moon, and the emotions belong to you.

Starting next year, Chinese students can apply for German undergraduates on the basis of high-level results
Recently, Germany's Anabin database for the assessment and certification of foreign qualifications announced on the official website: starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates can apply directly to German university undergraduates based on academic achievement, without having to first enroll in domestic universities.
Before that, Chinese high school graduates who want to apply for German universities would need to study one semester (211,985 colleges) or three semesters (general undergraduates) at the domestic undergraduate level and pass an APS audit or TestAS exam.
The publication of the new regulations will save at least half a year for Chinese students willing to study in Germany.
It is reported that the new regulations will come into effect in the second half of 2019.
Applicants must meet: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education, obtain a high school graduation certificate; participate in the exams, examinations and examination scores reaching 70% or more of the total score (if the total score is 750, it will need to reach 525) and include two language scores as well as one math or natural science grade.
In addition, the requirements of specific professional grades are different.
For example, applying for medicine, oral medicine, veterinary medicine, pharmacy and other professions, the examination score must reach 80% of the full score, and the examination subject must include at least two in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, or participation in a review; the application professional law class, the examination score must reach 80% of the full score, and the examination subject must contain at least two in foreign language, history, geography, or participation in an overview.
According to incomplete statistics, there are many countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and other countries that have recognized China's high-level examination results.
For example, in the United Kingdom, universities such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Leicester University accept Chinese students to apply for high-level studies.
Military "machine dog" first to perform class Solar theatre: consider incorporating the performance lineup.
The U.S. military has funded the development of "machine dogs" for battlefields, and now it is possible to get on the circus stage again!
Circus has said it is working with Boston Dynamics, a robotics company that develops robots to discuss the feasibility of robot applications for circus performances.
On the 24th of October, Boston Power Technology released a promotional film entitled "Spot for four-foot robots", which shows that Spot is an agile mobile robot capable of carrying 14 kilograms with high adaptability to cross-country terrain, 360 degree barrier function, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
In particular, Spot has an exclusive software platform only specifically developed for Spot, which users can set their own Spot robot capabilities through a variety of applications.
The Boston Dynamics technology company first published the concept of machine dogs in 1992, which caused a sensation at that time, but still not really put into commercial applications.
However, the Boston Dynamics Technology Corporation pointed out that Spot has now entered the mass production stage, and customers are mainly in construction and energy industries.
In addition, the Circus is currently in contact with Boston Dynamics Technology Inc., which says the plot is still under construction and is evaluating Spot's potential for use on the show scene.

Is Ma Hua re-elected for the JPJ National Debate in Denver Bay?
"Discussions by the Supreme Council of the National Front! "
In the meantime, whether Mahua of the RUF member party is standing up to this traditional country seat is a matter of great concern.
However, after the meeting of the Central Committee of Ma Hua announced that it was handed over to the Supreme Council of the National RUF to decide whether this traditional seat for Mahua will continue to be replaced by Mao Hua or other member parties.
After presiding over the meeting of the Mahua Central Committee on Thursday afternoon, Wei Jiaxiang told the media that any additional elections will be carried out in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), i.e. after a meeting through the Supreme Council of the RUF can be finalized.
He said that since the Elections Commission will meet next Monday to finalize the replacement of Dengwei Biai, the meeting of the Supreme Council of the National Front was expected to take place in early October.
"Yesterday (26th) morning, I also met the President of the National Front, Datuk Seri Amzahi, and we all agreed that this must be reclaimed from the League of Hope."
"We are poised to convene a meeting of the leaders of the FLDC in early October, and the three-party leader of the FLDC will determine which member party is going to stand up."
Inquiry as to whether Mahua would insist on the traditional seat of the RUF Supreme Council, Wei Jiaxiang reiterated that he must act in accordance with the standard operating procedures and therefore any decision must be reached by the RUF consensus.
"In any alternative, someone willing to march, there are political parties and some people think they should come out, which is commonplace."
"The most important thing is, what organizations and political alliances do we come from?"
"This is a great test of our political alliance for many years, and we believe that the National Front has come along with some valuable values."
"Someone may be saying something in this process, and it's unsurprising."
"But once the Supreme Council of the FNL has made a decision, everyone must fully prepare for war, which is the most expensive."
In any case, Wei Jiaxiang said that Mahua will make every effort at three levels - the district council, the state board and the Central Committee - to prepare for the upcoming candidacy of Danwei Biai.
"The district council is headed by the chairman of the District Council (Dangwei Biai) Datuk-Sri Yellow Sunrise; the state board will be led by the Chairman of the Jurassic Board Addict Lin Pexing; while the central committee will be personally deployed by the Director General Addict Ma Han Shun and the Secretary General.
On Saturday (21 ) Indigenous Solidarity Party MP Datuk Mohamad Fari died in the stupid jing government hospital for heart problems, aged 42.
A villagers in Hubei Baokan County hunted wild animals were ordered to "compulsate the mountain"
A villager in Hubei Baogang County was sentenced for hunting wild animals, and ordered him to pay 15,420 yuan (renminbi, the same).
Due to the family poverty of the accused, the prosecutor's office introduced alternative labor compensation for ecological repair costs, and achieved an organic unity of legal and social effects.
On the 27th, through three months of alternative labor such as "compulsory mountain inspection", Defendant Zhou has established deep feelings with wild kiwis and deeply blamed for previous animal hunting behavior.
On June 21, this year, a criminal incidental civil public welfare lawsuit filed by the Pocon County Prosecutor's Office was opened before the county court and handed down judgment.
The defendant Zhou was sentenced to three years in prison, four years in suspended sentences and a fine of 3000 yuan, while ordering him to compensate for the cost of ecological resource environmental damage restoration of 15420 yuan.
After checking, Zhou began to set up an electric grid at the mountain cliff in late January 2014, after which he hunted more than 20 wildlife species, including bumblebees, small suedees, cougar deer and so on.
The squirrels belong to the national level of endangered wildlife protection animals, small suede and deer are listed as "National Land-based Wildlife Conservation List".
During the trial, Zhou confessed his wrongful facts and actions and was willing to bear incidental civil liability.
But taking into account the poor economic situation in Zhou's home, under the coordination of Pocon County Prosecutor's Office, local village committees, forest stations and Zhou's three parties reached an agreement on alternative labor compensation ecological restoration costs: that is, Zhou by carrying out kiwi domestication and care work in the village kiwi reserve, compulsory mountain inspection, forest protection for a year, to provide public welfare labor service offset ecological repair costs.
In response to the Prosecutor's proposal, the court acknowledging that Zhou agreed to carry out probation while actively fulfilling his obligation to "substitute labor compensation for ecological repair costs".
At present, Zhou has been working in the kiwi protected area for three months, and is actively performing well.
In recent years, the Pocon County Prosecutor's Office in practice integrates prosecutorial functions and social governance behaviors, scientifically applying inspection recommendations, investigation supervision, litigation supervision and other monitoring methods, using judicial means to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment.
The United Nations awards the Earth Guardian Award for Ant Forest
In the midst of a warm applause and radiant music, "Animal Forest" project leader Xu Yi and user representative Shen Yuong walked to the podium, taking from the host the 2019 United Nations "Earth Guardian Award" trophy.
The 2019 Earth Guardian Awards Ceremony was held in New York, United States on the 26th, and the Ant Forest project to drive hundreds of millions of people into environmental action with a mobile phone small program won the "Incentive and Action Award" award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced a list of winners at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, but those who attended the ceremony on that day were still unmasturbating.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporter, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Annossen said "Ant Forest" was an exciting innovation that allowed hundreds of millions of people to act on environmental challenges and what humans can do for the environment.
It connects people and the environment with technology to enable each individual to participate in actions that protect the planet, which will have a huge impact.
"Ant Forest" was launched by China Ant Financial Services Group in August 2016 on the Alipay platform, users accumulate "green energy" through low-carbon actions such as recording their daily life's green travel, online payment of utility bills and electricity.
Each user has a virtual tree, "Animal Forest" and public-beneficial partners will plant a real tree in the desertification area.
As of August, 500 million "ant forest" users cumulatively reduced carbon emissions by 7.92 million tons and planted trees in desertification areas by 122 million.
In the awarding of the Earth Guardian Award, Costa Rica was awarded for its national environmental efforts, and a prize-winning Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado praised the contribution of "ant forests" on the spot, "which can inspire so many people to participate in green action that is impressive."
The chairman and CEO of Ant Financial said that the "Earth Guardian Award" is a confirmation of the ant forest project.
The technology and open platforms make it possible to engage people in low-carbon life, a honor that belongs to all participants.
He said that the "ant forest" has affected 500 million people over the past three years, and in the next three years the goal of "ant forest" is to drive 1 billion people worldwide into low-carbon action.
While combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring ways to make farmers' incomes more from cinnamon and green water.
In addition to providing employment through planting trees, it is also hoped that agricultural development projects and e-commerce platforms will help farmers achieve income growth.
The digital-based public welfare model created by Ant Forest has also been successfully launched, and is borrowed from other countries.
In June this year, the Philippines' largest e-wallet GCash launched the Philippine version of Ant Forest to encourage Filipino users to better protect their environment through a low-carbon life.
According to the report, GCash will work with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, environmental public welfare organizations etc., plan to plant 365,000 trees in the Philippines within one year of the project's launch.
The Earth Guardian Awards are the highest awards of the United Nations in environmental protection and are awarded once a year.
The "Anthony Forest" award was awarded for the third year in a row after China's Sehang Dam forest builder, Zhejiang province of China's "Thousand Village Demonstration and Thousand Village Remediation" project, from China's green innovation project won the "Incentive and Action Award" award.
Economic and trade frictions affect the U.S. economy's "record-list".
In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. economy's "documentary" shows that due to a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports, GDP growth has slowed significantly over the previous quarter.
Analysts point out that economic and trade frictions and their uncertainty are the main cause of a decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
The final revised data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on 26 December showed that GDP in the second quarter increased by 2% per annum, as compared to previously published revision figures, but significantly below the first quarter's 3.1%.
According to the data, consumption growth has been a major factor underpinning U.S. economic growth in the second quarter.
Individual consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the total U.S. economy, increased by 4.6% this quarter, boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government consumer spending and investment boosted economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private sector investment in the second quarter fell 6.3% compared to the previous quarter, dragging economic growth in the quarter by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7% compared with the previous quarter, and net exports dragged on economic growth in the quarter by 0.68 percentage points.
Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ansider Macroeconomic consulting firm in the United States, said that private sector investment not only failed to keep up last year's growth momentum, but also declined dramatically because economic and trade frictions and rising uncertainty have hit corporate confidence.
Knapp believes that under the influence of policy uncertainty, U.S. corporate capital spending is expected to remain in a downturn next year.
Analysts believe that while consumer growth has provided strong support for the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are growing signs that economic and trade frictions and their uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and negatively impacted the U.S. consumption outlook.
Richard Curtin, director of the investigation and professor of economics at the University of Michigan, said in a recent survey that 38 percent of consumers spontaneously referred to the negative effects of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a new high for one and a half years.
For the future American economic trend, analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow down.
But experts also said that if economic and trade frictions are eased, the performance of the U.S. industrial sector and financial markets will improve.
Kelly Burke, a global economist at the British Economist's Think Tank, predicts that the future U.S. economy will continue its downward trend since this year, with growth rates dropping to lower levels than in the second quarter.
Mark Zandy, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicts that the U.S. economy will grow 2.3% this year and further slow down to 1.6% next year on the assumption that economic and trade frictions will not continue to escalate.
Ellen Hazen, investment manager at Patnan Investment Corporation, pointed out that the company's current biggest concern is the economic and trade dispute and its uncertainties, which will be significantly reduced if the economic and trade disputes are resolved, and the performance of the industrial sector will be much better than it is now.
Miller-Tabak Asset Management's equity strategist Matt Melley said that trade and economic friction remains a "primary problem" and is also the main reason for the sharp fluctuations in the US capital market this year.
Ningxia's first husband and wife can take 10 days of parental leave each year
The guarantee of women &apos; s legitimate rights and interests is an expression of respect for and guarantees of human rights, as well as an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Session of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Law on Women's Rights and Interest Guarantee in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was passed by a high vote.
This is the first provincial-level local regulation for the full and systematic protection of women's legitimate rights and interests, which will be formally implemented on November 1, 2019.

In the Regulations, Ningxia encourages exploring the introduction of joint parental leave for both spouses, which is still the first in the country.
In April this year, the Executive Office of the State Council issued the "Guidelines for promoting the development of care services for children and young people under 3 years old" has a relevant description of the joint parenting of couples.
In the process of amending the Regulations, Ningxia innovatively proposed that "the employer's unit encourages couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations, to give each spouse a joint parental leave for 10 days per year during the period from 0 to 3 years of age".
At the same time, the Regulations highlight anti-sexual harassment and protection of female minors.
Article 43 of the Regulations takes into account the latest legislative results in China's current Civil Code personality code, detailing the components of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Regulations expressly prohibits frequent sexual assault and vicious incidents against girls, and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work as a new benchmark for the protection of girls in local legislation.
With regard to women &apos; s right to information and treatment of the common property of marriage and family, article 35 of the Regulations expressly provides for women &apos; s right to information about the common property and their obligations as well as related entities.
In addition, in response to the social hotspot - gender discrimination in employment - article 26 of the Regulations not only prohibits direct discrimination but also commands that indirect discrimination be prohibited and incorporates the latest practice of joint interviewing, strengthens penalties for sexual discrimination violations and more vigorously safeguards women's legitimate rights and interests.
In recent years, the Ningxia Women &apos; s Union Joint Public Examination Law Division and Civil Affairs departments have been promoting and introducing social professional forces to participate in the dispute settlement of marital and family disputes and anti-violence domestic violence.
The Regulations summarise and improve this, many laws encourage the mobilization of social forces, accumulation of social resources to jointly protect women's rights and interests, and require people's governments at or above county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Inner Mongolia Jingdong Yuan Lung Ping Academician Workstation Resilient to Salt and Alkali Rice Acro-Producted Rice Drainable Thousands of Kilometres
Reporter on the 27th from the administration of UNITA in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was informed that the "UNITA Yuan Lung Ping Academician's Workstation Salt and Alkali Reliable Rice Field Testing and Assessment Congress" had been held recently by the UIA, adding good news that the average salinized rice crop has broken a thousand pounds.
A team of 6 experts from the Heilongjiang Agricultural Academy, Yangzhou University and Hunan Agriculture and Rural Administration took part in sampling and harvesting of "Zing Salt Series" rice.
After expert evaluation, in PH values 8.8 to 9.6, the salinity content of 5 to 6 acres of land, saline-based rice resistance averaged 508.8 kg crop yields.
"Our next step is to build on this year's test, we will also innovate and reform, re-nurturing and optimizing salinary rice varieties, so as to make the quality better and produce higher."
"Under the premise that the factors of production are unchanged, I think we will continue to strengthen scientific and technological advancements, and salt-based rice resistance will continue to produce miracles in salanic soil."
UNITA belongs to the concentration of a number of special hardship areas in Lingnan Road, Daxingan.
In October 2018, Yuen Longping Academician's Work Stand was unveiled by the UNITA.
Yuan Longping led the team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the newly cultivated "salt alkali mixed rice" varieties and advanced technologies, building 960 acres of salt alkali based rice base at the right-wing Chinese flag in Kortsin, using a side test demonstration, and promoting a technical route that promotes local poor people's increased production and income, poverty reduction and enrichment.
This salt-based rice field test production not only injects hope for the upgrading of HINA's salanic and low-yielding fields to high-yielding fields, but also provides a scientific basis for the cultivation of salt-yielding rice under similar conditions in China.
After a marathon debate and weeks of protests, New Australia passed the abortion legalisation bill on September 26.
The bill has sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, with serious divisions within the AFP since independent MP Greenwich announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian Senate passed the abortion legalization bill on night 25 with 26 votes to 14, making it the third-longer bill for review in the New State Senate.
On the morning of 26th, after a final vote in the New State House, abortions were legalized.
The bill allows women to terminate pregnancy at 22 weeks of pregnancy and, if two doctors agree, also allows women to abort later in the pregnancy.
The Senate passed an amendment on the evening of 25, in which doctors could seek advice from a multidisciplinary team at the Hospital Advisory Board before performing abortion surgery for women after 22 weeks of pregnancy.
In addition, the amendments passed by the Senate include that doctors must provide appropriate care for surviving babies after termination of pregnancy.
Previously, New State Governor Berrigiklyan had faced public criticism from conservatives on the bill, and Berrigiklyan had intervened several times in order to secure more debate for the bill, but she did not attend the final vote.
"I need to take the time to manage the entire New State."
AFP lawmaker Davis, who was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to quit the new state government and called it a "government crisis."
But then Davis made concessions.
"The content of the amendment to the abortion legalization bill submitted to the House on the morning of 26th actually provides more guarantees for women and doctors."
Meanwhile, Australia's New State National Party leader Barrillaro said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
"What we did last night was historic for New York, which legalized abortions that were no longer a crime and would not treat abortion women as criminals."

Finance Minister Liu Kun: 67 central enterprises and financial institutions have transferred the state capital of 860.1 billion yuan to replenish the social security fund.
Minister of Finance Liu Kun said on 27th that as of now, 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have completed the transfer of part of state capital to replenish social security funds, a total of about 860.1 billion yuan.
Liu Kun made the above statement at the national transfer of some state-owned capital to replenish the social security fund task deployment meeting jointly convened by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources Social Security and the State Investor Committee.
"Transferment of part of the state capital to replenish social security funds is an important step in reforming and improving the basic pension insurance system, is a full reflection of the universal sharing of the results of the development of state enterprises and the intergenerational equity of the basic pension insurance system, is a policy measure based on current and long-term.
In 2017, the State Council issued the Implementing Programme for Transfer of Parts of State Capital to Enhancing Social Security Funds, which requested selecting some central enterprises and parts of provinces to carry out pilot projects.
According to Liu Kun, the pre-transfer work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, three batches of a total of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions have been completed in the transfer work, with the total amount of state capital transferred to about 860.1 billion yuan.
Among them, the transfer of central financial institutions that carry out the functions of the funder by the Ministry of Finance has been basically completed.
The transfer of central enterprises has already had a certain scale.
At the local level, pre-transfer work of enterprises has been carried out successively.
As of the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces was basically completed, respectively transferring state capital to 15.8 billion yuan and 18.5 billion yuan.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also carried out pre-transfer preparation work, laying the foundation for the next implementation of transfer.
According to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Human Resources Social Security, State Investor Committee, General Administration of Taxation and Supervisory Board jointly issued a notice on the previous day, the central and local transfer of part of state capital for replenishment of social security fund work was fully launched in 2019, and basically completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on that day made specific deployments for the full roll-out of the process.
The meeting emphasized the pragmatic and efficient completion of the deflection process.
"According to the progress arrangement, the transfer work is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.
Shifting the working time is tight, and tasks are heavy.
Liu Kun said that all regions and departments should carefully organize and carefully arrange to ensure the completion of the transfer work as required; solidly promote the work, accurately grasp the content of the transfer policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and promptly resolve the difficult issues.
The National Transfer of Complementary Social Security Fund - From the starting point of "Complementary Social Security Fund Money Bag", the destination is to provide strong support for pension protection.
However, the author believes that this is not a simple "physical shift" of equity, but an opening for "mathematical additions."
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, Department of Human Resources and Social Affairs, State Property Commission, General Administration of Taxation and Supervisory Board jointly issued a "Notification on the full initiation of the transfer of part of the state capital to replenish the social security fund", clarifying the timetable for the transfer of some state capital to supplement the social security fund, that is, the central and local transfer of part of the state capital to replenish the social security fund work was fully promoted in 2019.
After the publication of the document, departments such as the Ministry of Finance also implemented quickly.
On September 25th, the Ministry of Finance transferred all 10% of the shares held by commercial and agricultural banks to the Social Security Fund, with a total value of more than 115 billion yuan.
According to the regulations, Social Security Foundations and other entrants as financial investors enjoy the right of income, disposal and knowledge of the stakes assigned to the state-owned stock.
In the announcement, the Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture stated that this change in interest will not lead to changes in the Bank's controlling shareholders and actual controllers.
In this regard, I believe that similar transfer of state-owned enterprises is not a simple change in the ownership of equity, but "additional operations" that can stimulate a series of effects.
The first step in the transfer of social security to some countries is "additional results", which naturally can reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises and the shared development outcomes for all.
After years of reform and development, state enterprises, especially CC companies in China's economy are mostly in important industries and fields, the overall profitability is strong and more stable.
Among them, the leading enterprises are more sustainable to achieve excellence and strength.
On July 10, the Standing Meeting of the State Council decided that this year to fully promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to replenish the Social Security Fund.
The Ministry of Finance has said that it will work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Meeting of the State Council, to fully promote the transfer of some state-owned capital to replenish the social security fund, fully reflect the basic pension insurance system intergenerational equity and the development results of state-owned enterprises.
The second step of the transition "additional results" is to enhance the sustainability of our Social Security Fund and further strengthen the foundation of pension and social security system.
With the population ageing, our social security funds are under pressure, and this state investment as a transferable subject, most of them have continuous profitability and dividend ability, not only can effectively supplement the social security fund, but also provides the source of living water for the social security fund.
According to estimates, each transfer of 3.8 percentage points of state capital can support the company's basic pension insurance contribution by a reduction of 1 percentage point.
The third step of the transition "additional results" is to add stabilizers for capital markets.
The way in which this transfer is carried out to receive the proceeds of the subject is "divided and operated as a complement".
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, the Social Security Fund is indeed dominated by equity dividends.
However, Social Security Funds as value investors in the capital market have a strong capital operation capacity.
For listed assets in state capital, the Social Security Fund's participation and ownership will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will help to improve the level of enterprise operations, and have a positive and positive impact on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the Social Security Fund as an investment trend indicator, raising equity weight, is conducive to further strengthening its influence in the market and plays a role as a "stabler" in the market.
In addition, it is also conducive to fully implement the "value discovery" function of institutional investors, guiding rational investment and value investing.

U.S. Senate Approves Scalia as Labor Secretary - Xinhua Network

Scalia will succeed Alexander Acosta.
Acosta, the then labor minister, who was accused of "lenient treatment" for American billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, suspected of sexually assaulting and selling teenage girls, announced his resignation in July under great pressure from public opinion.

Iran has been confirmed to develop advanced centrifuges and further suspends implementation of the Iranian nuclear agreement
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on the 26th that Iran used advanced centrifuges to make uranium enrichment, and it has again violated the IEA nuclear agreement.
Iran is reportedly progressively violating the restrictions of the IEA in response to President Trump's withdrawal from the IEA in May 2018, restoring and strengthening sanctions against Iran.
In July, Iran suspended two other commitments to keep the stock of enriched uranium below 300 kg and not less than 3.67% of its purity - further moves now.
Under the nuclear deal, Iran could only set up about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, and would allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced models for research, but did not produce concentrated uranium.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce enriched uranium at several times faster and possibly for the use of nuclear bombs.
"On September 25, the Agency confirmed that Iran was developing advanced centrifuges for Model 2 and Model 3.
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to Member States on 26 January, when a diplomatic official responded: "They are busy at the [Nathanz-enriched uranium] facility."

Italian Minister of Education proposed a sugar tax to protect the health of the population.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, the new Italian government's cabinet minister of education and five-star movement member, recently presented a motion to parliament recommending that the Italian government implement a new tax policy on sugary drinks, snacks and air tickets.
According to a bill proposed by the Minister of Education Fioramonti, the Italian government will impose a snack tax on sugary drinks, snacks and other products that are harmful to health; at the same time it imposes an environmental tax on air tickets, 1 euros for domestic flights and 1.5 euros for international classes.
Fiorama Monty said that through this series of seemingly small tax measures, the government expects to get 3 billion euros in taxes.
The proceeds of this tax will be used in the fields of education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister Conte said he believed it was a viable solution; Salvini, an Italian congressman, European MP and coalition leader, ironically tweeted that you should quickly hide desserts, cookies, bread and candy as the new government begins to impose a snack tax.
According to the report, snack taxes generally refer to a special tax on sugar-sweetened beverages and high-calorie foods.
Taxation of this type contributes to the benefit of public health.

Baidu's first self-driving taxi fleet opens trial
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Changsha that the self-driving taxi team Robotaxi test operation officially opened.
The first 45 "Red Flag EV" robotaxi fleets jointly developed by Apollo and a steam red flag began to test operations in the long sand area, which has been open for testing.
From now on, ordinary Changsha citizens can log in to the Apollo website for seed users and have an opportunity to try out the experience.
One experienced passenger said he was sitting in the rear of the vehicle, tapping on the front screen of the passenger seat and opening a key to the vehicle's self-driving journey.
In the car, in order to ensure passengers' safety and current policy regulations, test-run vehicles are equipped with a security guard at their cockpit, maximizing passenger safety.
During the driving process, the vehicle can conduct intelligent transmission according to the road condition, and can also judge the driving conditions of the surrounding vehicle, and automatically avoid such situations as close-distance overtaking.
Throughout the tour, the passenger area screen displays pedestrians, cars and even some traditional blind spots on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, you can see information such as changes in the front red and green lights and waiting time in advance, all traffic conditions are clear.
Drivers had previously heard on television that thought they were far from us, but today it was found in our lives and felt magical.
We look forward to its real future in the lives of our people.
In June 2019, Apollo received a 45 manned test license issued by the Changsha Municipality.
At present, Changsha's self-driving testing opens the way through Changsha Artificial Intelligence Technology City, Meixi Lake, Yangshuo Lake, Kingshan, High New Area and other areas, reaching a total length of 135 kilometers, the demonstration area reaches 70 square kilometers, is currently China's longest road mileage, the largest area, covering the most complex scene, the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration zone.

China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
(New China 70 Years) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge.
The White Paper states that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or challenge.
The white paper said that with the rapid rise of China's comprehensive national power and international influence, some people on the international level are worried that China will take the path of "national power must be supremacy", while others have proposed a so-called "Chinese threat theory".
There are both cognitive misreading, deep-rooted prejudices, and psychological imbalances caused by the loss of power, as well as deliberate distortions to defend their own vested interests.
The realization of richness, national revitalization and people's happiness is both the dream of the Chinese people as well as the common dream of all peoples.
"China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat and challenge."
The white paper pointed out that China is the main stabilizer and power source of world economic growth, China is the largest contributor to world economic growth, Chinese science and technology innovation injects new energy into world economic growth, future role of China's economy stabilizer and power source more prominent.
The current global economic growth is underdeveloped, and the robust Chinese economy is becoming increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, agricultural modernization accelerated, the deep adjustment of economic structure, continuous upgrading of industrial optimization, and the emergence of new economic growth points.
"The McKinsey Global Research Institute's study concludes that by 2040, the integration of China and other economies in the world is expected to create between $22 trillion and $37 trillion of economic value, equivalent to 15%-26% of the total global economy, and strengthening cooperation among other economies in the world and China will create huge economic value."
The white paper emphasizes that the Chinese economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes, deep integration.
China, whose economic performance is more stable, higher quality of growth and long-term prospects for growth, is a long-term benefit for the world's economic development.
Considering China's economic development as a "threat" and a "challenge", trying to squeeze China out of the global industrial chain, supply chain, value chain, so that China is "decoupled" from the world economy is neither viable nor harmful.
The White Paper states that full-scale openness to the outside world creates more opportunities for countries to share "Chinese dividends".
China unwaveringly pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win open strategy to achieve greater strength and higher level of external opening, China has the world's most potential consumer market, China is the most attractive investment destination, more massive "outside" benefiting more countries.
"Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, and not one-way, one-party benefit."
"The mutual benefit of the two-way can last for a long time."
The white paper said that China is committed to continuously expanding imports, relaxing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection, and other countries should also expand their opening-up, take appropriate initiatives and strive to improve their own business environment.
Only the parties can create an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win development environment, together to make the "cake" of development more and bigger, forming a mutually beneficial and win-win community of interests.
The White Paper states that China provides more public goods to the international community.
Including promoting the construction of a high-quality "Belt and Road", building a multilateral dialogue and cooperation platform, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively conducting foreign assistance.
"China's development is benefiting from the international community, and it has never forgotten to give back to the international family so as to provide more and better public goods to the international community."
Andrei Slepnov, general manager of the Russian export center, said in a written interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters recently that Russia is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in the field of economic and trade, further optimize the export structure and promote diversification of Russian exports to China.

In recent years, Russia's exports of non-raw materials and non-energy products to China have also shown a good and stable development.
Speaking about Russia's optimization of its export structure to China, Slepnov said that the Russian side has set up a task on expanding exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products from countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will then improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
Slepnioff said that Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China, and has developed cooperation with China in the fields of pharmaceuticals and aeronautical manufacturing.
Russia and China also have great potential for cooperation in the area of urban environmental development.
He stressed that Russia's products in many areas are "quality advantages, and prices are competitive" compared to similar Western products.
Turning to the two countries' goal of achieving a $200 billion bilateral trade volume by 2024, Slepnov said that areas such as agriculture, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry will play an important role in achieving this goal.
The Russian side is interested in promoting diversification of supply in these areas and facilitating the export of deep-processed products.
He stressed that Russia intends to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, where China is one of the directions for development.
Manufacturers in Russia's agriculture, metallurgy, oil and natural gas and chemical industries are fully capable of participating in this process.
At present, the two countries need to continue deepening cooperation between enterprises, "create more Russian-Chinese joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries".
Slepnov said that the Russian Export Center is taking a number of measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Agency and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support exports of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Center will continue to deepen cooperation with relevant departments of China, promote more convenient access to the Chinese market for Russian goods and develop new types of export products to China.

Demonstrations on the President's Desperation of Egyptian Mountain Rain Wanted by Authorities Showing Powerful Repression
Twitter theme tags and social media are urging Egyptians to take the streets today in a peaceful manner demanding President Cecilia's resignation.
But the authorities have already indicated their intention to use force to repress.
Since then military chief Cecilia took power in the 2013 military coup, dissent was almost extinguished in Egypt and any form of protest would be even more dangerous.
The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organization in Cairo, said more than 1,900 people had been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests calling for Cecilia to step down.
The corruption charges of vanity surrounding Ceci and his family's squandering of public money led thousands to street demonstrations on the 20th.
The position of the Egyptian Interior Ministry yesterday firmly stated that any attempt to destabilize the country would be decisively slammed and never softened.
The city center of Cairo has long been alert, and the streets around the 2011 Egyptian Revolution detonated Tahrir Square can be seen everywhere by the riot police, security agencies vehicles and plaintiffs.
Al Jazeera reports that security forces detained several important scholars and social sages on the 25th day, including a professor of political science at Cairo University and a well-known columnist Nafa.
He tweeted on the 24th, "I have no doubt that continuing to give Cecilia absolute rule will cause disaster."
"It was in Egypt's interest that he would immediately step down."
Before Nafa's arrest, Hosni, who served as spokesman for Annan, Egypt's former military chief of staff, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after trying to compete with Cecilia for the presidency.
The president of the constitutional party, Davoud, was also detained.
Analysts and political figures believe that at a time when the economic dilemmas of the poor and middle-class worsen, sweeping dissident practices reflect government instability and fragility.
The opposition leader, Ayman Nour, who once ran for president, said: "The arresting action underscores the regime's indifference to the Egyptian people and how scared it is."
"Because the economy has been messed up by him, coupled with widespread political oppression, Sessy tries to convey a clear message to important generals and politicians who may be replaced."
Noor points out that under the premise of continued deterioration in socio-economic conditions, the government's use of high-pressure tactics will only increase people's anger.
Since the barrier of fear has been smashed, he expects more people to walk on the streets.
Ali, an expatriate businessman and actor in Spain who was a construction contractor for the Egyptian military, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month claiming to have benefited from government corruption that ignited small-scale demonstrations in different cities last weekend.
Ali said his company Armrac's general contract could be profitable without having to go through the legal tender process, stressing that the military and relatives of Sesi, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi, have been corrupted.
He repented of his involvement.
Ali claims that his assistance to Cecigue's magnificent palace and luxury hotels is in stark contrast to the extreme poverty of the current Egyptians, and that the other party has not yet paid for it.
On Twitter, thematic labels such as "Come up and you're not alone", "Sacey is fucked up," "Saceid Rolls" and "Next Friday" have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retractions calling for people to walk peacefully on the streets demanding Cessy's resignation.
The tweet of Hollywood Egyptian star Amarwick has nearly seven million followers.
He tweeted in Arabic yesterday: "Sisi is doomed to finish... he's done, and those who support him are now going to make a big mistake."

Are motorists tired of brains as well?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed that after high-intensity exercise, the brain also shows signs of fatigue.
The study, led by Marcel Pesiglion, an expert at the Pitier-Salpetrill Hospital in France, shows that there is an undistinguished link between mental and physical labor: both require cognitive control of activity.
"You need to control the autonomic process that can force you to stop when it comes to muscle and joint pain."
The study was initiated by the French National Academy of Sport and Physical Education (INSEP).
The school's experts are responsible for guiding athletes to prepare for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to suffer from overtraining syndrome, i.e. after high load exercise there is an insurmountable feeling of fatigue, the body can not recover, and results decline.
INSEP raises a question: Will some of the causes of this condition be neuro fatigue, which is caused by excessive brain labor?
The report was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Let Chinese citizens "go out" more securely - Visiting the consular director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Choi Aiming
Wherever you go, the motherland is behind you.
On the 25th, the first foreign ministry's consular protection of public goods short film was launched, and this sentence at the end of the short film resonated with the majority of netizens.
In an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporter, consular director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Choi Aiming said that the short film is intended to further make people feel the "diplomatic for citizens" sentiment and temperature, so that Chinese citizens feel that no matter where in the world, Chinese diplomats will extend their help, help, power and hope.
There is no peace in the world, and there is nothing to do with it.
Choi Yimin said that in the past 70 years, the number of Chinese citizens "go out" has increased dramatically, from the "less than a million people per year" before reform and opening up to today's over billions of people annually; at the same time, China's citizens travel abroad is safer and more secure, and the objects of consular protection work and assistance have also expanded from overseas Chinese to various groups such as Chinese expatriates, tourists, foreign students, and workers.
According to statistics, since the 18th Congress of the party, we have carried out more than 10 major evacuations or transfers of Chinese citizens overseas and evacuated more than 40,000 Chinese citizens safely from dangerous and volatile areas.
About 500,000 cases involving nearly one million Chinese citizens were accepted and coordinated.
At times of danger, the motherland can take you home; trying to come "to say and go" is no longer a dream.
According to Choi Aiming, as of the end of August this year, China has concluded a mutual visa-free agreement with 14 countries covering ordinary passport personnel.
In addition, more and more countries unilaterally grant entry facilities such as visa-free or landing visas to Chinese citizens.
Thailand, Egypt and other 42 countries unilaterally granted visas to Chinese citizens with common passports, while another 15 countries such as Indonesia have unilaterally permitted visa-free entry for Chinese citizens with ordinary passports.
In addition to visa-free, land-based and other arrangements, Chinese citizens' applications for visas are becoming more convenient and simplified.
By the end of August, China had reached agreements or arrangements to simplify visa procedures with 41 countries.
Among other things, there are agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel, Argentina for tourism, business personnel to issue 10-year valid multiple visas, and with the UK for each other travel, business, family visiters to issue two-year multi-entry visa arrangements.
The UK, Belgium jointly launched the "Visa One-stop" service, with France, Italy and Singapore reducing visa reception times to 48, 36 and 24 hours respectively.
For business people who often travel abroad, a multi-entry and conveniently cleared APEC Business Travel Card is not lost as a good option.
According to Choi Aiming, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining multiple five-year visas from 16 economies around Asia Pacific, which means "going out" for business people, especially private enterprises.
At present, China's effective card holding rate ranks first among the APEC economies.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, promote more countries to adopt visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, make the results of diplomatic work more translated into profit-seeking people's initiatives, and continuously improve the "golden content" of Chinese passports.

"One-on-one" of the two high-pressure projects.
On the 26th, Baidong-Anyuan +-1100 thousand volt high voltage DC transmission project and Suton 1000 thousand volt ACTS high voltage GIL complex pipeline project.
Both of these projects occupy the current production highs in the respective fields of world transmission technology, and after shipment will greatly improve China's vast range of energy optimization configuration.
Guo Zhi, the general economician of the National Energy Administration, said that Baidong-Aungnan project is the world's largest power delivery capacity and the longest transmission distance.
Its operations are important for promoting the development of Xinjiang's energy base and ensuring electricity supply in eastern China.
GIL, the gas insulating metal closed transmission lines.
Sutong Portal Engineering, created the highest voltage level of GIL engineering in the world and the strongest transmission capacity record, achieved the "communication double loop network" ring operation of the highest voltage level of the East China Backbone Grid.
According to the National Grid Company, the Transmission Distance of Baidong-Anyuan Engineering is up to 3,324 km.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15% of electricity will be lost on the way, and the project has been closed down to research and development, so that the economic transmission distance significantly increased to more than 3000 kilometers.
After the shipment of Baidong-Anyuan project, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes, which can help to solve the problem of depletion of existing new energy in Xinjiang.
According to full load estimation, the annual electricity delivery of this single line will reach 60-85 billion kWh, which can meet more than half of Shanghai's electricity consumption throughout the year.
Sutong GIL Complex Project is a controllable project across the Yangtze River through the special high-pressure communication ring.
If the conventional overhead line is adopted across the Yangtze River, two super-450 meters giant towers will need to be erected on the surface of the Yangtze River and an artificial island with a size exceeding four football fields for each tower.
In this regard, the National Grid has boldly innovated, developed a compact special high-voltage AC GIL transmission technology, passing through the tunnel from the submerged river, to avoid the impact on the gold lane.
Two projects have promoted the production capacity of electrician equipment in China to achieve a new leap.
At present, the National Grid has built a cumulative "10-to-11 straight" special high-pressure project, and there are also "4-to-3 straight" construction.
Foreign Exchange Agency: My foreign debt structure continues to optimize and external debt stability improves
"Overall, my foreign debt structure continues to be optimized and the stability of foreign debt is enhanced."
Wang Chuning, a spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration and general economist, said on 27th that the main indicators of my foreign debt are within the internationally recognized security line, external debt risk can be controlled in general.
Wang Chuning made the above statement when he published foreign debt data in late June 2019 by the Foreign Exchange Office on the same day, answering questions from reporters.
Data show that by the end of June 2019, China's full-calibre (including its foreign currency) external debt balance was $1998 billion, an increase of $26.3 billion compared to the end of March 2019, an increase of 1.3%, mainly due to the growth of the debt securities balance.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of China's full-calibre foreign debt increase was driven by non-resident purchases of domestic RMB bonds, and the majority of non-residents were mainly central bank and medium- and long-term investors.
In late June 2019, the ratio of medium- and long-term foreign debt accounted for three percentage points in March 2019, while the ratio of domestic foreign debt accounted for one percentage point in March 2019.
Wang said that with the renminbi bonds in China were incorporated into the Bloomberg Barclays Global Integrated Index in April 2019, international investors' recognition of the Chinese bond market further increased and continued to hold domestic renminbi bonds.
"China's balance of payments maintains an overall balance, and foreign debt risks can be controlled."
Reporter learned on the 27th from the Agricultural Academy of Yunnan Province, that currently Yunnan grassland hazing moths have been effectively prevented and controlled, without causing large-scale outbreaks and disaster prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
In January this year, Jiangcheng County of Yunnan Puer City for the first time found grassland grafting moths moving from abroad, and then confirmed in 129 counties in Yunnan, grassland grafting moths also gradually spread from Yunnan to China's domestic land, which poses a direct threat to Chinese food production.
The grass-roots hazing moth is a multi-food, long-range migrating important agricultural pest originating in the Americas and subtropical regions. It is a major migrating pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's global early warning that has "international character, migratory nature, exacerbation and destruction".
The pest is harmful to more than 80 crops such as corn, sugarcane and sorghum, with a large amount of food intake that can cause up to 70% production losses.
The fight against the pest is difficult, and there are no registered pesticides in China.
Since the wetland graft of night moths incursion into Yunnan, Yunnan Provincial Agricultural Science Academy selected Chen Aidong Research Fellow to lead the agricultural cross-border harmful organisms from the China Agricultural Science Academy in Yunnan Province in collaboration with the green prevention and control innovation team, heading for the first line, field investigation, sample collection, and carry out technical guidance and test demonstration.
Chen Ai Dong team has initially mastered the population characteristics of Yunnan grassland grafting night moths, enemy insect resources, foreign pest source characteristics, population migration trajectory, drug toxicity and field control effects.
They actively carry out green control technology research and application, through the implementation of new technologies such as population monitoring, insect catching, scientific drugs and agronomic measures, the protection and control effect has reached more than 90% in the demonstration area, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting the resources and ecological environment of the enemy, providing technical guarantees for Yunnan to effectively control the outbreak of grassland hazing moths and sustainable governance.
At present, Yunnan grassland grafting of night moths has been effectively prevented and controlled, not causing large-scale outbreaks to occur, and the prevention and control work has achieved phased results.
Next step, the Yunnan Agricultural Academy will focus on ecological mechanisms for population migration and incursions and outbreaks, break through biological control and green anti-control technology system construction.
At the same time, actively promote cross-border international cooperation and strive to establish joint key laboratories and joint monitoring sites and demonstration zones abroad in order to enhance the full range of monitoring and early warning capabilities of Yunnan grasslands.

New rules for consultation: Social capital access to rural land operations needs qualifications
Social capital acquisition of rural land-use rights requires qualifications
The Scheme for the Management of Transfers of Rights in Rural Land Operations is publicly solicited and proposed to regulate transfers of social capital, such as business enterprises, into land operations rights.
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a public consultation notice on the "Rural Land Management Approach (Revised Draft for Opinions)" (hereinafter referred to as The Draft for Opinions), which increased the supervision and risk prevention of social capital flows such as business enterprises in obtaining land management rights.
The draft of the Opinions has now been publicly solicited by the community.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in order to follow up on the implementation of the newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracting, further consolidate and improve the basic rural business system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the "three-right split" system, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has revised the method of managing the transfer of rights for rural land contracting and operating.
The reporter of the Beijing Youth Daily learned that there were several important amendments to the first published Opinions Draft.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracts clearly defines the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three-right split", special sections set out respectively "land contracting business rights" and "land management rights", which makes a clear distinction between land contracting business transfer, interchange and land turnover (rental, subcontract, equity or other means).
In this draft of opinions, in order to implement the concept of "three rights division", effectively respond to the essence of the Law on Rural Land Contracting Law, and taking into account the large differences between land transfer and land contracting business rights interchange, transfer in parties, procedures, supervision and so on, this revised draft has defined the scope of the circulation, focusing on the flow of land management rights, the mode of turnover including rental, shareholding, etc., changed the name of regulations from the rural land contracting business right transfer management method to the "Rural land operation right transfer management method".
The transfer and interchange of land contracting business rights will be subject to separate management methods.
In the opinion draft, it is pointed out that in the context of "three-right split", farmers are only allowed to invest in a certain period of land operations.
In theory, even if an insolvency settlement occurs, farmers only have the risk of losing a certain period of business rights, so it is no longer legal necessity to provide contractual return to their original contracted households and there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law.
In order to prevent the risk of land loss for farmers, priority stocks, first-time shares, repurchases and other methods have been developed in practice.
Taking into account the more mature theoretical discussion of priority stocks in corporate law, it is recommended that they be used as an advocative provision to prevent risk of loss of ownership.

The Royal Association for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (RSPCA) New South Wales Attorney General David O'Shannessy told ABC that regulation and inspection of slaughterhouses in Australia should be commonplace.
"For those who care about animals, the surveillance system will certainly be a strong hint that animal welfare is the most important."
The U.S. Geological Survey's International Earthquake Map shows that Iceland did not have an earthquake in the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Agency also reported that there had been no seismic activity in the Hekla area over the past 48 hours.
Major seismic activity leading to phase change took place on the northeast side of the crater at the top of the volcano on March 10.
According to reports, there are clouds at the bottom of the mountain that are unrelated to volcanic activity.
These clouds may cause people to suspect that the volcano has actually erupted.

He has also been accused of copyright infringement but has not been sued.
One student he taught said the teacher "will use slang in class, teach dating techniques in notes like being a student's friend."
Over the past three decades, although official levels have remained a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reform was carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
Last year, China's auto exports outpaced Germany for the first time and surpassed the United States as the largest market for automotive exports.
China's GDP is likely to overtake the US in 20 years.
Tropical Storm "Danny" formed in the east of the Atlantic, which is the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, with the maximum sustained wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 kilometers per hour).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Daniel will be augmented into a major hurricane by Wednesday.
Given that the storm has not yet landed, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Zagreb, Croatia, Bobeck became famous when playing for the Belgrade guerrilla football club.

"Luckily I didn't do anything, but I saw a terrifying scene where people tried to break the windows and escape."
People punched the glass with chairs, but the windows were indestructible.
Survivor Franziczek Kowal said: "At last there was a piece of glass broken and they began to escape from the window."
Stars emit light and heat, because hydrogen atoms bind (or fusion) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists are currently working to create a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult problem to solve. It takes many years for us to see practical fusion reactors built.
Due to the effect of surface tension, steel needles can float on the surface.
The reason for surface tension is the strong attraction between water molecules on the surface, and the gravitational pull between them is greater than the attraction between water molecules and air molecules above.
The water molecules form a layer of invisible outer skin on the surface of the water, which can make things like needles floating on the surface.
The blades of modern ice skating shoes are double-edged, with a hole between the edge and the edge. Both edges have better grip on the ice (even when tilting).
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade turns to one side of it, the edge of the knife in contact with the ice bends.
In this way, the skater can turn. The ice knife tilts to the right and the skater turns to the right. The ice knife leans toward the left and the skater turns to the left.
They have to remove excess energy from light in order to return to previous levels of energy.
They do this by emitting a tiny photoparticle called "photons."
Scientists call this process "stressed radiation" because the atoms are stimulated by strong light, causing photons to be released, and light is also a form of radiation.
The next picture shows how atoms emit photons. Of course, actually photons are much smaller than what they look like on the image.
Photonics are even smaller than atoms!
After several hundred hours of use, the light filament was eventually burned and the light bulbs were not brightened.
Then you need to replace the light bulbs. Be careful when changing the light bulbs.
First, it is important to close the switch of lighting fixtures or disconnect the cable connection.
This is because when a portion of the light bulb is connected to the socket, when you are exposed to the metal base in or inside the socket, the current flows into the socket (connection of the light bulb metal base), which causes you to suffer severe electrical shocks.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for transporting blood.
Blood flows from the heart through a pipeline known as an artery, and then backflows to the heart through a pipe called vein.
The teeth of the triangular dragon can not only bite leaves, but also bite very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triangular dragons are powered by Sutra, a plant very common during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree, and the crown is made up of nail-like sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the triangular dragon would strip the leaves with its strong beak mouth.
Other scientists believe these plants are toxic, so dinosaurs are less likely to eat them even though now sloths and other animals such as parrots (the descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you stand on the surface, your weight will be lighter than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the woodcut. So gravity naturally gives you a smaller traction.
The sun doesn't stand above the crust like Earth. The entire sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The farther you are from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas is.
What we see outside the sun is called a photosphere, meaning "the ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used telescopes to observe objects and found that Venus had a position consistent with the Moon.
The phase change occurs because Venus (or the moon) is only illuminated toward the sun. Venus's phase change supports Copernicus' theory that planets rotate around the sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transience of Venus.
After reconquering the Danish area of law (Danelaw), England experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991, Esselreed faced the largest Viking fleet after a century-old Gusrum fleet.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trigwazon, a Norwegian who wanted to take Norway back from the hands of Denmark.
After the initial military defeat, Esselrede finally reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway trying to regain the throne, but not a success.
The Korean alphabet is the only alphabet specifically invented for everyday use, which was invented during the reign of Emperor Szeung in 1444 (1418 - 1450).
The king was the fourth monarch of the Korean dynasty and one of the most revered monarchs.
He initially named the Korean alphabetic pronunciation table as "honoured voice," meaning "the correct pronunciation used to teach people."
There are many claims about the origin of Sanskrit. One of these is that the Aryans emigrated from the West to India and brought their own language here.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The earliest known books in the world were written in Sanskrit. After the preparation of the Book of Aries was completed, it gradually disappeared due to hierarchical reasons.
Sanskrit is a deep-seated language and the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the French war, Germany began preparing for an invasion of British Isles.
Germany has designated the attack as Operation Sea Lions. The British army lost most of its heavy weapons and supplies when it withdrew from Dunkirk, causing significant injuries.
But the Royal Navy is still much stronger than the German navy ("Kriegsmarine") and can destroy any invading fleet crossing the British Channel.
However, few Royal Navy ships are stationed near potential intrusion routes as naval generals fear they will be sunk by German air strikes.
Let us first explain Italy's plan, which is basically the "small brothers" of Germany and Japan.
The country's army and navy were weaker, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main target is the African countries, which need an army base in order to seize them so that they can sail through the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
For this reason, they had to withdraw British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the Italian warships should not have acted.
Now look at Japan. Like the UK, Japan is an island nation.
Submarines are designed for sailing under the water, and submarines stay under the water for a longer period of time.
Submarines were used during World War I and World War II, at which time they were slow and the range of shooting was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, most of them sailed on the surface of the sea, but as radars developed and improved precision, submarines were forced to dive into the underwater so they could not be found.
German submarines are known as U-class submarines. Germans are very good at navigation and operation of submarines.
Due to the success of the Germans in submarines, they were not accommodated by a large number of submarines after the war.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King of Tut" or "Juvenile King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be an important figure in antiquity and was not recorded on the list of most ancient kings.
However, his tomb was discovered in 1922 and made him a celebrity. Although many of the past graves were stolen, it was almost untouched.
Most of Tutankhamun's coffins are kept intact, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of the radial wheel made the Assyrians' warships lighter, faster and easier to drive than soldiers and other combat vehicles.
They shot arrows from deadly crossbows and penetrated enemy armor. A thousand years ago BC, the Assyrians used the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army fighting on the horse's back. At that time, saddles had not been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry could only fight on the bare horse's back.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. The most famous person in Greek culture may be the legendary blind poet Homer who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliath and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristotlephanes are still popular playwrights whose plays are considered one of the greatest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, whose most famous achievement was to present a well-known theorem of the relationship between the sides of the straight triangle.
There are different accounts of the number of people speaking Hindi. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native languages depends on whether the closely related dialects are counted.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak this language ranges from 340 to 500 million, while there are as many as 800 million people who can understand it.
Indian and Urdu languages have similar vocabulary, but the text is written in different ways; both languages can usually be communicated and interoperable during everyday conversations.
15th century ago, northern Estonia was deeply influenced by German culture.
Some German friars wanted to bring God closer to their natives, so they invented the Estonian text language.
It was added a letter "O/O" in the German alphabet.
Over time, many German foreign words were merged with the original vocabulary. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, crown inheritors are enrolled directly after completing their studies.
Charles enrolled in the Trinity College of Cambridge, however, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, followed by history with a 2:2 degree (second and second degrees).
Charles was the first British royalist to earn a degree.
Turkey's part of Europe (located in Eastern Thrace or Rumilia on the Balkans) accounts for 3% of its territory.
Turkey's territory is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long and 800 kilometers wide (500 miles) roughly rectangular.
Turkey's land area (including lakes) is 783,562 km2 (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 km2 (291,773 sq mi) is located in South-West Asia and 23,764 km2 (9,174 sq mi) is located in Europe.
Turkey's area ranks 37th in the world, roughly the total of French and British areas.
Turkey's three sides of the sea: to the west is the Aegean Sea, to the north is the Black Sea and to the south is the Mediterranean.
Luxembourg is a long-established country, but it became independent in 1839.
Some parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but were delegated to Belgium after the 1930s Belgian revolution.
Luxembourg has been trying to become a neutral state, but it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization now known as the EU.
Drukgyal Dzong is a devastated fortress and Buddhist temple located in the upper part of the Paro district (in Fonda village).
It is said that Zabdrung nawang Namgyel built the fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan army.
In 1951, a fire caused Fort Dukeey to have only one trace of remains, such as the statue of Zabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was maintained and protected as one of Bhutan's highest-profile attractions.
Cambodia in the 18th century was intertwined between Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
In the last few years of the 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen per cent of Venezuelans are unemployed, with the majority working in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, with nearly a quarter working in industry and one-fifth working in agriculture.
Venezuela is a net oil exporter, and although only one percent of people work in the oil industry, the oil industry remains an important sector in the country.
In the early days of national independence, Singapore Botanical Gardens pioneered its expertise to help make the island a tropical "garde city".
In 1981, Zhujin Wandeland was chosen as the country's national flower. It is a hybrid variety of orchids.
Around 1.5 million herbivores depart every year around October from the northern mountains, passing through the Mara River and heading to the rainy southern plains.
Then, after a rainy season around April, back from the west to the north, crossing the Mara River again.
Serengeti Areas include Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve in Tanzania, Maswa Wildlife Reserve and Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional traditional skills, as well as tools mastered in interactive courses (storyboard production, audio and video editing, story plot design, etc.).
Interaction design requires you to reassess the assumptions about media production and learn nonlinear thinking.
Interaction design requires the interconnection of each component of a project, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of the zoom lens is that in order to achieve a certain focal length range, the amount of focal length complexity and lens components required is much greater than the focal lens.
With lens manufacturers reaching higher standards in the production of lenses, this is no longer a problem.
This allows the zoom lens to take photos that are comparable to the fixed focal length lens quality.
Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the lens's maximum aperture (speed) is usually smaller.
This makes it difficult for cheap zoom lenses to be used in weak light conditions without flashes.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert movies into DVD formats is overscanning.
Most TV shows are made for entertainment.
For this reason, the screen boundaries you see on TV, including top, bottom and side sides, have been trimmed.
This is done to ensure that the image can cover the entire screen, which is called "overscanning".
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its borders are likely to be cut off, and if the subtitles in the video are too close to the bottom, they will also appear incomplete.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired people's imagination, reminiscent of the images of horseback spears like bacon, banquet and knighthood of King Arthur.
Even in the ruins of thousands of years, it is easy to recall the sound and smell of a long-suffering war, almost hear the colliding sounds of cobblestones on horseshoes, and smell the breath of fear coming out of ground pits.
But are our imaginations realistically based, why did they first build castles and how were they designed and built?
As a typical building of that period, it is not to say that the Castle of Merxloe is a real castle, but rather a fortified house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls cannot withstand a resolute attack for a long time.
In the 1580s, when Lord Hastings began building the castle, the country was relatively peaceful and needed only to defend a small group of roaming looters.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries seek to preserve the sovereignty of all European nations.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country from becoming stronger alone, so governments often replace allies in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish battle of succession marks the first war with a balance of power at its core.
This marks an important change, as European powers will no longer be able to presume a religious war. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War will be the last war labeled "religious."
On 21 July 356 BC, the act of arson by Herostratus destroyed the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus.
The indignation of the Ephesus declares Herostratus to be an impeccable name, according to the storyline.
Greek historian Strabo later mentioned the name, which we know today. The temple was destroyed on the night of Alexander the Great's birth.
Alexander the Great proposed to rebuild the temple, but its proposal was rejected. After his death it was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible while still hitting all the notes correctly - and fingers try not to do too much unrelated action.
This will save you as much physical strength as possible. Remember, don't use the power to punch the keys on a piano to boost your volume.
In order to increase the volume of the organ, you can use more force or pull the windbox at a faster speed.
Mysticism seeks to communicate, identify or attain a conscious consciousness with ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth or God.
Believers seek a direct experience, intuition or enlightenment about the divine reality/divineness or Gods.
A follower pursues a certain lifestyle or practices designed to nourish these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship, as it emphasizes the direct experience of individuals with a unique state of consciousness, especially those peaceful, insightful, happy or even ecstatic states of consciousness.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent, which originated in the Punjabi region in the 15th century and stems from sectarian divisions within Hindu traditions.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a religion different from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that Sikhism is derived from Hinduism and also contains Hindu traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat and in Punjabi means "the path of the Guru," which is an essential part of all Indian religions, but has a particularly high status in Sikhism and remains at the heart of the Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), and then nine more.
However, in June 1956, when Polish workers protested the unrest of food shortages and wage cuts that turned into protests against the communist regime itself, Khrushchev's promise faced a test.
Despite the fact that Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order, he made concessions to some economic demands and agreed to appoint popularly welcomed Wladyslaw Gomulka as new prime minister.
The Indian River Basin Civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located in the north-western subcontinent of India, covering much of modern Pakistan as well as some parts of northwest and northeast Afghanistan.
The civilization of the Indian River Basin flourished, and this civilization is therefore named.
Although some scholars speculate that, given the existence of this civilization in the now dried Saraswati river basin, it is appropriate to call it "Indian-Saraswati" but some refer to it as "Harapa Civilization" - the first site discovered in the region in the 1920s.
The militaristic character of the Roman Empire contributed to the progress and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical team for postwar medicine.
Surgeons are aware of various sedatives, including morphine extracted from poppy seeds and concoctional scopolin extracted from chopper seeds.
In addition to using blood arresters and arterial cuffs to stop blood flow, they have been able to save anthrax patients by amputation.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has made great achievements in the field of medicine, making up much of what we know today.
The net earth folding paper, its restrictions rule is that only one fold at a time, does not allow reverse folding such a more complex action, and all the position of folding must be simple and clear.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help unexperienced papermakers or those with poor hands-on abilities.
When a child is young, they are aware of racial and ethnic stereotypes that affect their behavior.
For example, if children of a minority are modeled as having poor performance at school, they tend to have bad performance in schools once they understand patterns about their own ethnicity.
MySpace is the third-largest and most popular website in the United States with 54 million registered accounts.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These sites are also useful, such as the easy creation of a class page that contains blogs, videos, photos and more.
It's easy to access the page with just one URL. This is easier to remember and easier to enter for students who don't have difficulty using keyboards or spelling.
It can be customized for reading, and it can also use more or less colors according to needs.
"Attention Deficiency" is a nervous system syndrome with three typical qualifiers including impulse, distraction, hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a lack of learning ability, but an obstacle to learning; this "affected between 3% and 5% of children across the U.S. with numbers likely as high as 2 million."
Children with ADHD are hard to concentrate on doing things, such as doing jobs, but they can focus on what they like, such as playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing some unmarked sentences.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because normal methods can't stimulate their brains, and in order to stimulate the brain they "make dangerous behaviors, fights, challenge authority."
Attention Deficiency Obstacles (ADD) affects the relationship between sick children and their peers, because other children can't understand why patients behave, spelling or why they are different in maturity.
When the ability to acquire and learn as described above changes occur, the basic rate of acquiring knowledge is also correspondingly changed.
The way to get information is different. Pressure no longer exists in personal memories, but the ability to recall text becomes more important.
The Renaissance has fundamentally changed the way in which learning and knowledge are disseminated.
The place where primitive humans differ from other primates is that they no longer move their bodies with their hands, lift weights, and clutter in the woods.
The size and length of the chimpanzee's hands and feet are similar, which reflects the fact that the hand is used to carry weight in its fingertip walk.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, and the finger (toe) bones are straighter.
From 2 million to 3 million years ago, hand bones have not only manifested the characteristics of hands, from the way of moving to the way of operation, has undergone changes.
Some people believe that frequent artificially induced and clear dreams can make you exhausted.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that clear dreams extend the time interval between fast eye movements.
The shorter the rapid eye movement period (REM) per night, the less frequent sleep in this state and recovery of fumes, the body may have problems.
It's as exhausting as waking up to watch TV every two or three minutes.
Its effect depends on the frequency of your brain making lucid dreams every night.
On 10 June 1940, less than a week after Italy's declaration of war, the British 11th Light Cavalry occupied Capzoburg in Libya.
In an ambush in eastern Batia, the British captured General Ratussi, the engineer commander of the 10th Italian Army.
On 28 June, the Libyan Governor and successor to Mussolini Marshal Italo Balbo were shot dead by enemy forces when they landed in Tobruk.
The modern swordsmanship movement is divided into several levels: there are the level of initial study for university students, as well as the level of professional and Olympic sports.
The movement was mainly carried out in the form of a confrontation, i.e. one sniper and another sniper.
Golf is a sport where players hit the ball into the hole with poles.
The regular game takes an 18-hole round, and players usually start from the first hole on the pitch until the end of the 18th hole.
Players who complete the match with a minimum number of hits or waving rods win.
The race was carried out on the grass, and the grass surrounding the caves were trimmed shorter, known as a green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is also what most people think about when they are traveling: leisure travel.
This refers to people going to a place that is quite different from their daily lives for relaxation and entertainment.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are usually the most visited places for leisure travelers.
If a person visits a particular place with the aim of understanding its history and culture, then this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different landmarks in a particular country or only concentrate on one area.
Seeing such activities, the colonizers also demanded reinforcements.
The forces supporting the frontier positions included 200 New Hampshire 1st and 3rd Regiments, commanded by Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed (who later became generals).
Stark's soldiers marched along the defensive fence at the north end of the colonists' position.
The mysterious river flowing along the northeast of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly erected a short stone wall that extended it to small beaches at the north end of the shore.
Gridley or Stark placed a wooden stump 100 feet (30 meters) before the fence and ordered that no fire should be fired before the regular army passed.
The United States plans to launch synergistic attacks in three different directions.
General John Cadwad will launch an offensive against the British garrison in Poden Town, diverting enemy attention to block any reinforcements.
General James Ewing, with a force of 700 militiamen crossing the river at the Trenton ferry port, occupied the bridge on the Ascenpink Bay and blocked the enemy's escape path.
The 2,400 men's main force will cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, a group led by Greene and a group led by Sullivan to launch an offensive before dawn.
From a quarter-mile to a half-mile run, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes an absolute factor.
Of course, to become a first-class half-mile runner (running in two minutes), you have to be fast enough and develop endurance at all costs.
In the winter to practice cross-country running, plus fitness exercises for the upper body, can be fully prepared for the runner season.
A proper nutrition practice alone is not enough to produce excellent performance, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Keeping a healthy energy balance, sticking to the habit of effectively replenishing water, understanding all aspects of rational use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase sports fun.
The mid- and long run is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions among participants about the equipment they need.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most products have little practical impact on performance.
Athletes may think they tend to a product, although the product is useless.
Atomics can be considered as one of the basic components of all matter.
According to the simplified por model, this is a very complex entity that contains a central nucleus surrounded by electrons which are somewhat like planets orbiting the sun.
The atomic nucleus consists of both neutrons and protons.
Protons have positive electricity, neutrons are not powered.
To inspect the victim, you must first survey the site to ensure your own safety.
When close to the victim, attention should be paid to his position and any unintentional danger signals.
If you want to help others get hurt, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and disastrous emotions played an intermediary role in the pain and disability of patients with pelvic pain.
Only the effects of worrying thinking, rather than frustration and fear, can structured physical exercise regularly on a conditional basis every week.
Those involved in regular training need more support for the passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort from normal body movements.
The ability to visualize or see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, namely the eyes.
The structure of the eye has many species, and its complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different functions, are sensitive to different wavelengths and differ in sharpness. They also need different processing methods to understand inputs and require different quantities of inputs to achieve optimal results.
Clusters are a collection of specific species of organisms within a particular geographical area.
When all individuals in the population are exactly the same on a particular phenotype trait, they call it single.
When individuals exhibit several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
The marching and nesting of the army's ants are also in different stages.
During the migrating phase, marching ants travel at night and stop camping during the day.
When available food is diminished, the ant group will enter a period of migration. At this stage, the ant group will build temporary nests that are replaced every day.
This nomadic bruising behavior lasts for about 17 days each time.
The term "cella" derives from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room," originally created by microscopicists who observe the structure of softwood.
Cells are the basic constituent units of all organisms, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells have such a foundational and critical position in biological research that they are often referred to as "the basic unit of life."
The nervous system maintains blood flow smoothly by sending nerve impulses to the whole body, thus maintaining balance in the body.
These nerve pulses can be transmitted very quickly to the whole body, leaving the body free from any potential threat.
Compared with other violent storms, the area of tornado attacks is smaller but can destroy everything through.
The tornado is able to root trees, tear the wooden boards on the building and throw cars into the sky. Two percent of the tornadoes are most violent and can continue to rage for more than three hours.
These monster-like storms, wind speeds up to 480 kilometers per hour (133 m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands of years, humans have been making and using magnifying glasses.
However, the first real telescope was made in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look both near and large.
Agreement and selfishness are always with us, and the nature of cooperation is that short-term selfish behavior can always bring more benefits when most people benefit.
Hopefully, most people will realize that working with others is the best option in the long run.
Many people dream that one day humans can migrate to other planets and explore other worlds. Some people want to know what the universe is; some believe there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this really happens, then it's likely that it won't happen again for a long time. These stars are very dispersed and "neighboring" stars separated by trillions of miles.
Perhaps one day your descendants will live in an alien world, guessing what kind of life their ancient ancestors lived at that time.
Animals are made up of many cells. After eating food, animals digest it in the body.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals, for example, a sailor doesn't have brains).
There are animals in every corner of the earth, some digging holes underground, some floating through the oceans and some flying over the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units in all kinds of organisms.
The term cell (cell) derives from the Latin cellulara (meaning a small room).
Looking at creatures under the microscope, you will find that they are made up of small chunks or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, saw some small blocks in the wretch with a microscope.
They looked like a room. He was the first to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can change objects in the event of chemical changes.
The gaseous nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is denser, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. Composite water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether it's gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is right around us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the object of research by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars.
The time we've been through is a series of events that never come to the present and past.
Time is also the way we compare event duration (length).
You can record the passage of time by observing repeated cyclical events. Periodic events refer to things that happen regularly over and over again.
Today, we use computers to process pictures and videos.
Complex animations can be built on computers, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to television and movies.
Music recordings are often processed with complex computers, and the sound is mixed together.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries it was believed that New Zealand's first inhabitants were Maori, who hunted a large bird called a terrorist.
The theory then established a view that the Maori migrated from Polynesia by "big boat" and took New Zealand from the Moriorians to establish an agricultural society.
But there is new evidence that the Moriorians belong to the mainland Maori community, who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own unique culture of peace.
There is another tribe on the Chatham Islands, who are Maori immigrants from New Zealand.
They call themselves Morriorians. There have been some minor clashes, and the Moriorians were finally wiped out.
Those who have been involved for decades have helped us to recognize our strengths and passions while honestly assessing difficulties, or even failures.
When listening to stories of others sharing their personal, family and organization, we have a valuable understanding of the past as well as some people who have had either good or bad influence on organizational culture.
While understanding history does not mean understanding culture, at least it can help people understand their place in organizational history.
When summarizing successes and failures, individuals and all participants will have a deeper understanding of the values, mission and driving forces of the organization.
In this case, revisiting previous entrepreneurial behaviors and successes can help keep people open to new changes and new directions in the local church.
Such success stories eased fears of change while creating positive tendencies for future changes.
Converging thinking patterns are problem-solving techniques by combining different ideas or areas to find solutions.
This mode of thinking emphasizes speed, logic and accuracy, as well as verifying facts, reapplying to existing technologies and collecting information.
The most important factor in this mode of thinking is that there is only one correct answer. You just need to consider two answers, either right or wrong.
This mode of thinking is not unrelated to certain scientific or standard procedures.
People of this type of thinking have logical thinking, can remember patterns, problem-solving, and also carry out scientific tests.
So far, humans are the best species to read about other people's minds.
This means that we can successfully predict the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires of others.
In these abilities, understanding the intentions of others is essential. With this ability we can understand the ambiguities that may be expressed by physical behavior.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window of the car, you're likely to think that this person is stealing a stranger's car.
If he lost his car keys and tried to open the door of his car, it might have to be different.
Magnetic resonance imaging is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Percerer (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit weak radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, Ph.D. and research scientist, discovered the basics of using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was approved, the world's first patented field of nuclear magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first "all-body" magnetic resonance scanner he called a "node".
Asynchronous communication gives people time to think about the reactions of others and react.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and control the rhythm of teaching information.
In addition, there are less time constraints due to the flexibility of working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
Learners can access information at any time using the Internet and the World Wide Web.
Students can also submit questions to teachers at any time of the day, and they can expect quick responses within a reasonable amount of time rather than waiting until the next interview.
The postmodern method of learning gives absolute freedom. There is no one way to learn that is good.
In fact, nothing needs specialised learning. The behavior of learning takes place when learners experience the presentation of knowledge.
Our current experience of all TV shows with DIY, information and learning as the main content illustrates this.
Many of us find themselves watching TV shows telling us some sort of process or experience, but we never engage in or apply that knowledge.
We will never renovate the car, don't build fountains in the backyard, don't go to Peru to explore ancient monuments or transform a neighbor's house.
Thanks to subsea cables and broadband satellites connected to Europe, Greenland's network connectivity is clear, with 93% of the population accessing the Internet.
Your hotel or landlord (if staying in a residential or private home) may have Wi-Fi or networked computers. All locations have a internet cafe or public wi-fi location.
As mentioned above, while the term "Eskimo people" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic region, especially for Canadians, consider it to be derogatory.
Although you might hear the term used by native Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
In Canada, Greenland's indigenous people call themselves "Inuit" and in Greenland they call themselves "Kalaalleq," which means "Grenans".
In Greenland, crimes and malicious acts against foreigners are generally almost unheard of. Even in towns there is no "high crime zone".
The cold may be the only real danger that unprepared people will face.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (remember to go northward and cooler), be sure to bring enough warm clothing.
Long daylights in the summer can cause sleep deprivation and related health problems.
In the summer, you should also pay attention to mosquitoes in northern Europe. Although these mosquitoes do not spread any disease, they may cause discomfort.
San Francisco's economy is linked to being a world-class tourist destination, but its economy is diversified.
The most employable sectors include professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
It often appears in music, film, literature and pop culture, making the city and its landmarks famous.
San Francisco has developed a large-scale tourism infrastructure with many hotels, restaurants and first-class conference venues.
San Francisco is also a good place to taste other Asian dishes such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese in the United States.
For many American families, going to Disneyland is a grand event.
This "typical" playoff process includes flying to Orlando International Airport, driving to Disney Park Hotel, playing around a week at Disney and returning home.
Disney's gameplay is innumerable, but for most people it means to go to Disneyland.
Many tickets sold on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day passes.
While this is a very common behavior, Disney forbids it: tickets are non-transferable.
Camp licences are required before they can be camped below the edge of the Grand Canyon.
In order to protect the Grand Canyon, license limits are issued. Four months in advance at the start of the month, which begins on the first day of the month.
Therefore, if the start date is May, a wild camping license will be issued on January 1.
The most popular areas, such as Bright Angel campgrounds near the Phantom Ranch, usually receive full-time reservations when opening on the first day.
For unscheduled visits, the number of licences is limited and permits are provided in accordance with the principle of prior arrival.
Southern Africa is ideal for driving, with visitors enjoying all the views of the area as well as reaching destinations beyond regular tourist routes.
As long as careful planning, ordinary cars can be done, but it is strongly recommended to use four-wheel drive vehicles, and in many places only a large axis quadruple car can pass.
During the planning period, keep in mind that while southern Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries do.
Visa requirements and fees vary according to country/region, and will be affected by your nationality.
Each country/region has a specific law providing for emergency items that must be placed in the car.
Victoria Falls Town is a small town in western Zimbabwe bordered by Livingstone of Zambia, close to Botswana.
The town is close to the waterfall, which is the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers ample opportunities for explorers and sightseeing travelers.
In the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water will be higher, and the waterfalls will become more rushing.
If you cross the bridge or walk along a winding path near the waterfall, you will certainly get wet.
On the other hand, precisely because the amount of water is too large, the sight will be blocked by the water, and you can not see the full waterfall!
Tutankhamun Cemetery (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the valley. Howard Carter discovered the young king's nearly complete royal graveyard in 1922.
But, compared to most other royal mausoleums, the Tutankhamun tomb is hardly worth visiting because it is much smaller in size and its decoration is unsurprising.
If someone wants to see the mummy removed from the coffin damaged, then these people can be greatly missed, because you can only see the head and shoulders of the mummy.
The vast wealth of ancient tombs is no longer in the tomb, but transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Tourists with limited time are better off choosing other destinations.
The temple is located 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built in the late 9th century under King Jefanvaramo's rule.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tunle Sap make it worth climbing to the top.
When visiting the sights, you can also by boat stroll through the lake.
You need to buy Angkor tickets to get into the temple, so don't forget to bring a passport when you go to Lake Tunle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries/regions and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Located on the ancient city of Judean Hills, it has been an intriguing history for thousands of years.
The city is the holy site of three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - a true spiritual, religious and cultural center.
The religious significance of Jerusalem, especially many places in the Old City, makes it one of Israel's major tourist destinations.
Not only are there many historical, archaeological and cultural sites in Jerusalem, but also vibrant malls, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador stipulates that Cuban citizens must enter Ecuador through international airports or border crossings upon receipt of an invitation letter.
The letter must be approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and meets certain requirements.
These requirements were designed to achieve orderly migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a green card in the United States should visit Ecuador's consulate for exemption from this requirement.
Your passport should be at least 6 months away from departure, and a return/joint ticket is required to prove your stay time.
Travel is cheaper for a larger number of travel teams. If you're alone or with only one friend, try to meet someone else and form a trip team of 4-6 people so that the price per capita can be improved.
But there is also a bit of concern, as tourists are often transported to and past to fill the car.
This is actually more like a scammering way to make people think they have to pay more money.
This steep peak, towering at the northern end of Machu Picchu, often serves as a backdrop for many site photos.
Looking up from below is a bit scary, and it's steep and difficult to climb, but most people who are well-equipped should be able to finish in 45 minutes.
Most of the road sections of the trail are paved with stone steps; in the steeper part there is a steel cable as a support arm.
It is said that it will make people breathless, and in the steep places to be careful, especially when the weather is wet, the situation may soon become dangerous.
It has to pass through a very low, narrow little hole near the top.
To explore the sights and wildlife of Galapagos Islands, the best way to travel is by boat. Charles Darwin was on board in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships regularly fly back and forth in the waters of the Galapagos Islands - their weight varies from 8 to 100.
Most people set up positions early (because the boat usually gets crowded in high seasons).
Be sure that your agent for booking a trip is an expert in the Galapagos Islands (Galapagos) with extensive knowledge of various vessels.
This ensures that a certain interest and/or constraint conditions are matched to the vessels most suitable for them.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, northern Chile was governed by Inca, while indigenous Araucanians (i.e. Mapche) lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche people were also one of the last independent Native American tribes. It was not until after Chile's independence that they were completely subjugated by Spanish-speaking rulers.
Despite Chile's declaration of independence in 1810 (Spain had no functioning central government during the Napoleonic Wars for several years), it was not until 1818 that Spain won a decisive victory.
Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country located in the eastern half of Ispanjola, divided into Dominica and Haiti.
In addition to having white sandy beaches and mountain views, the country is home to the oldest European-style city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The Tainos and Caribes first came to settle on the island. The Caribbean was a native of Arawakan, which arrived around 10,000 BC.
In just a few years after the arrival of European explorers, Spanish conquistadors greatly reduced the population of Tynos.
According to Tratado de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, Spanish invaders killed about 100,000 Taiwanese.
The Garden of the Union (Jardin de la Unión) was a 17th-century monastery in which San Diego Temple is the only existing building.
Now this is the central square, and day and night are busy.
There are many restaurants around the garden, and there are often free concerts in the central rainbow during the afternoon and evening.
Callejon del Beso ( kiss alley). Two 69 cm apart balconies are a place where ancient love legends happen.
Just give a little money, you can let some kids tell the story.
Baoyun Island is a popular destination for day or weekend trips, offering tourist projects and services such as kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants.
This real-life community is located in the Haw Bay near Vancouver, easily accessible by a regular water taxi departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, they must hike to Sea to Sky.
Due to the 2010 Winter Olympics, Whisler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive but famously prestigious.
In winter, enjoy some of North America's best skiing sites; in summer try some real mountain bike rides.
The license must be pre-ordered. You have to hold a license before you can spend the night in Selina.
Sirena is the only safari station that offers accommodation and hot meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer camping services without catering.
Can be licensed directly from the Park Management Service in Puerto Jimenez, but cannot use credit cards
The Parking Authority issued only a licence for the park within one month prior to the expected date of visitation.
CafeNet El Sol offers an appointment fee of $30, while a one-day pass is priced at $10; details can be found on its Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands is an island nation, a free-binding zone of New Zealand located in Polynesia in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands, spread over a surface of 2.2 million square kilometers.
Because Hawaii is in the same time zone, these islands are sometimes considered "southern Hawaii".
Although small in size, it brings some older visitors to the pre-state Hawaii where there weren't so many large sightseeing hotels and other development projects.
The Cook Islands do not have a city, but consist of 15 different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, the provision of luxury accommodation has risen to an art form.
In the high-end market, it is obvious that a number of B&B companies compete mainly in two areas: bed and breakfast.
So in such a beautiful place, people often find the most luxurious bedding, perhaps a handmade quilt, or a long-standing bed.
Breakfast may include local fare or specialties offered by the owner.
The scene could be a historic ancient building with antique incense furniture, pruning tidy ground and swimming pool.
Sit into your own car and start a long road trip, which in itself has a simple pure attraction.
Unlike large cars, you may already be familiar with driving your own car and know its limitations.
Build tents in private real estate or small towns of any size can easily attract unnecessary attention.
In short, driving is a great way of self-driving, but it's not suitable for "camping" in itself.
If you have a larger minivan, sports shuttle, sedans or travel car and the seat can be flattened then you can take a car camping.
The origins of some hotels can be traced back to the golden age of steam trains and oceangoing ships: before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were the footholds of rich and famous people at the time, and usually have high-end restaurants and nightlife venues.
Traditional equipment, lack of the latest facilities and an age-old sense of elegance are also their characteristics.
While they are usually privately owned, they also sometimes provide accommodation for visiting heads of state and other dignitaries.
A fast-paced traveler may consider flying around the world and staying in many such hotels along the way.
The Equestrian Exchange Network is an organization that connects travelers with the local residents of their destination city.
Joining such an organization usually requires only filling in an online form; although some organizations provide or require additional verification.
Subsequently, a list of paper and/or online editions will be made available to all those who still have vacant premises, sometimes identifying the recommendations and evaluation information of other travellers.
Couch Surf was founded in January 2004, before which computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no residence.
After he sent emails to students at local universities, the invitation for free accommodation sprawled.
The hostel mainly serves young people, and the 20-year-olds are their typical customers, but you can also meet relatively elderly people there often.
Although there are few families with children, some hostels will allow them to live in single rooms.
Beijing, China, will be the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will therefore become the first to host both summer and winter Olympic Games.
Beijing will host openings, closings and indoor ice skating events.
Other skiing events will take place at Zhangjiakou Resort, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most of the temples have annual festivals, beginning at the end of November and ending in mid-May, each with different festival times.
Most of the temple festivals are held in order to celebrate the anniversary of the temple and preside over God's birthday.
Temple festivals in Kerala are extremely interesting, usually with decorated elephant parades, temple orchestral performances and other festivities.
The World Exposition (commonly known as the Expo) is an international event that showcases art and science.
The participating countries organize art and education exhibitions in the national pavilions to showcase world problems or their own culture and history.
The World Gardening Fair is a showcase of floral, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
Although theoretically the World Expo can be held once a year (as long as it takes place in different countries), this is not true.
The duration of these projects usually varies from three to six months, and is held at sites not less than 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. Standard 35mm films (36x24mm) are the most common.
If the film is finished, it can usually be easily recharged, and the resolution presented is roughly no different from the current DSLR camera.
Some mid-frame film cameras use 6x6cm, or more accurately, a 56x56mm bottom.
In this way, the resolution reached almost four times more than 35 mm substrate (3136 mm2 to 864).
For photographers, wildlife is one of the hardest to photograph. Good luck, patience, experience and good equipment are lacking.
Many people are accustomed to wildlife photography, but like ordinary photographic works, a photograph is more than tens of thousands of words.
Shooting wildlife usually uses long-track lenses, but shooting objects such as birds or microbiomes require other lenses.
Many rare animals are difficult to find, and parks sometimes have provisions for commercial photography.
Wild animals have fearsome people, some are aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or harsh.
More than 5,000 different languages in the world, of which more than 20 are spoken by over 50 million people.
Moreover, written texts are often easier to understand than verbal ones. This is especially true when describing the address, as it is usually difficult to read clearly.
In many countries/regions, people all over the country can speak fluent English, and in more countries there is a slight familiarity with English, especially young people.
If you want, imagine a Manchester man, a Boston man, a Jamaican man and a Sydney man sitting around in a restaurant in Toronto for dinner.
They tell the story of their hometown in their own unique accents and local Turkish, making each other happy.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to fill your stomach. If there are no cooking conditions, you can only choose ready-made foods.
There are more and more varieties of finished foods in supermarkets, some even offer microwaves or other methods to heat food.
In some countries or certain types of shops, at least one restaurant (often informal) is quite affordable.
Copy and carry several copies of your insurer's detailed contact details.
In order to advise, authorize and claim, they need to show the insurer's email address and international phone number.
A copy is placed in the luggage and a copy is stored online (send attachments to yourself by e-mail, or stored in "cloud").
If you carry a laptop or tablet on your trip, store a copy in memory or disk (no network is available).
At the same time, copies of insurance contracts/contacts are handed over to travel companions and relatives and friends willing to help after returning home.
Homoose (also known as elk) are inherently unattractive, but they can also defend themselves if they feel threatened.
Some people who don't take hump as a potential danger may be too close to putting themselves at risk.
A moderate amount of alcohol-containing beverages. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to understand their drinking limits.
Excessive drinking can lead to long-term health problems, such as liver damage, and even blindness and death.
Illegal spirits may contain a variety of dangerous impurities, including methanol, and even small doses can lead to blindness or death.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider doing eye examinations in the country (especially when medical insurance can be reimbursed), and then take prescriptions to other places for mirroring.
There are two problems with high-end brand mirrors purchased in these areas: some may be rustic goods, and genuine imported mirror racks may be more expensive than domestic purchases.
Coffee is one of the most traded commodities in the world, and you are likely to buy a wide variety of coffee in your hometown.
Despite this, there are still many unique ways to drink coffee in the world that deserve to be experienced.
When the stream descends into the bottom of the canyon, the canyon can be dried up or there is a very deep water.
The brook falls combine the elements of swimming, climbing and jumping - but only a relatively small amount of training and physical base can be accessed (compared to rock climbing, scuba diving, mountain skiing, etc.).
Distance is an outdoor activity that walks in a natural environment (usually on hiking trails).
One-day hike is a one-day trip, which can be less than 1 mile away.
There is hardly any preparation for hiking a day along a smooth trail, and anyone can enjoy hiking as long as the body is not poor.
Families with children may need more preparation, but it is not difficult to spend a day outdoors even if they bring babies and preschool kids.
There are nearly 200 running tourism organizations around the world, most of which operate independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of sightseeing operators across four continents.
The organization was founded in Barcelona's Run Tours Barcelona (Running Tours Barcelona) and Copenhagen's Run Copenhagen (Running Copenhagen), followed by Prague's Running Tours Prague (Running Tours Prague) and others.
Before and during the journey, you have to take into account many aspects.
When you travel, don't expect everything to be like "at home." Courtesy, law, diet, transportation, accommodation, standards and language are different from where you live.
This is something you need to keep in mind forever so as to avoid disappointment or even disgust at local practices.
Travel agents have been in existence since the 19th century. If a traveler is unfamiliar with the nature, culture and language of the destination or plans to travel to low-income countries during a journey, travel agencies will generally be a good choice.
While most travel agencies are willing to accept the majority of regular appointments, there are also a number of travel agencies specializing in specific types, budgeting or destination-specific travel operations.
It is best to find an agent that often books like your journey.
Look at what travel agency promotes tourism products, which can be viewed on the website or in the store window.
Whether it's necessary or in order to change your lifestyle and challenge yourself, if you want to spend the least money looking at the world, some ways can help you.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either working on the side of a trip or minimizing expenses.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort and time, like surpriseful travels, and reduce their spending to close to zero, see The Minimum Budget Travel Offensive.
The scenario assumes that travelers do not steal, unlawfully invade, participate in the illegal market, beg or exploit others for their own benefit.
Entry checkpoints are usually the first stations to pass after a plane, boat or other means of transport.
Checks of some cross-border trains are carried out on the car; when boarding a cross-border train, they should carry valid identification documents.
On a nightboard train, in order not to interfere with passenger sleep, the head of the train may collect passports in advance.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you must register your presence and address with local governments.
This may require going to the local police station filling out a form or visiting an immigration office.
In many countries where such laws exist, local hotels can register (must be asked clearly).
In other cases, only persons living outside the tourist accommodation facilities are required to register.
Architecture is a study of architectural design and construction. Buildings in one place are often touristic attractions themselves.
The appearance of many buildings is beautiful, whether it looks from the top or looking out from an ingenious window where you can see a wonderful sight.
There is considerable overlap between construction and urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given that many Pueblos live very remotely, you have to go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe in order to enjoy a rich nightlife.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above supply drinks, some of which also offer well-known entertainment activities (mainly large casinos close to Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Note: For tourists from other states, the small town bar here is not always a good place to wander around.
First, there are serious drunk driving problems in northern New Mexico and a high proportion of drivers near the small town bar.
Excessively painted murals or unscathed painting are known as graffiti.
Although this is by no means a modern phenomenon, most people are likely to associate it with the use of spray paints by young people that destroy public and private property.
However, now there are mature graffiti artists, graffiti campaigns and "legal" graffiti walls. In this context, graffiti painting is often more similar to artwork than hard-to-discriminate labels.
Throwing darts is a popular skill many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn to throw back darts and let them fly out after they can fly back in your hands, be sure to use the right back darts that can fly back.
In fact, most of the hammers on the Australian market don't fly back. Beginners should not try to throw hammers in the wind
Hangi refers to kilns.
The pit holes are heated by burning stones, and in some places use geothermal to make the ground naturally warm.
Stone pots are often used to cook traditional grilled meat meals.
Rotorua offers geothermal kilns (hangi) in several places, while other practices of Maori kilns can also be tasted at Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
There are metrorail carriages on commuter trains in and around Cape Town, Metrorail has two levels: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (also called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but a little cheaper than the average metro ticket in Europe.
Each train has MetroPlus and Metro carriages; the former is always at the end of the train close to Cape Town.
Carry items for others - don't let the luggage leave your sight, especially when it comes to entry and exit.
You may find yourself being exploited and becoming a poisoner without knowing it, which will put you in great trouble.
This includes waiting queues, as it is possible to use the anti-drug dog at any time without prior notice.
In some countries, even first-time offenders are subject to extremely severe punishments; penalties may include imprisonment for more than 10 years or death sentences.
Unsupervised bags are not only the target of thieves, but also considered as a bomb threat, raising the authorities' vigilance and attention.
When at home, because you are often exposed to local germs, you are very likely to have immunity from them.
But elsewhere in the world where there has never been a bacteriological group, you are much more likely to have problems.
And in warm climates, bacteria can reproduce quickly and survive for longer.
Thus, scourges such as "Derry Diarrhea", "Pharaoh's Curse" and "Montezuma's vengeance" appeared.
As cold climates are prone to respiratory problems, hot climates can also cause intestinal problems. In the vast majority of cases, gastrointestinal problems may be significant discomfort but not very dangerous.
If you first travel to developing countries, or go to a strange place, don't underestimate the possible cultural shocks.
Many emotionally stable and capable travellers have been intimidated by the new problems of travel to developing countries, where there is a need for rapid adaptation to many nuanced cultural differences that follow.
Especially in the early days, you can consider how much money is spent on Western-style and high-quality hotels, food and services to help you adapt to your environment.
In areas where there is no knowledge of the local animal population, do not sleep on mattresses or mats on the ground.
If you are going to camp, take a camping bed or hamlet so as not to harm snakes and scorpions.
Enjoy chic coffee at home in the morning, while relaxing chamomile tea is served during the night.
Home in the home holiday, at hand more time, you can spend a little more time to drink a special drink, reward yourself.
If you want to update the singularity, take advantage of this opportunity to squeeze some juice or make mixed milkshakes:
Perhaps you will find a simple drink that can be made during breakfast when returning to regular daily routines.
If you live in cities with a variety of drinking cultures, go to bars or pubs in those neighborhoods where you don't often go.
For those who are unfamiliar with medical terms, the meanings of the words "contagious" and "touchable" are quite different.
Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasites.
Infectious diseases are a type of disease that is highly prone to transmission near the infected.
Many governments require inbound tourists or departing residents to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements usually depend on the country where the traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina is that it provides many high-quality options for families.
Households from other regions often hail family friendship as their main reason for moving there, and tourists will find it very comfortable to visit the city with their children.
Over the past 20 years, Charlotte's child-friendly facilities have achieved exponential growth.
Families living in Charlotte generally do not use taxis except in exceptional circumstances.
Passengers more than 2 people need extra fees, so this option may be expensive and unnecessary.
The Antarctic is surrounded by Antarctica and is the coldest place on Earth.
The travel costs are high and the requirements for physical quality are also high, and can only be visited in the summer of November to February 2015, where visits are mainly limited to the Peninsula, Islands and Ross Sea.
In the summer, more than 40 bases here will host thousands of staff, most of whom are stationed in the area; a small group stays wintering.
Antarctica's interior is a desolate plateau covered with 2-3 km thick ice.
Occasionally there are special air travel missions to inland, mountaineering or large bases in the South Arctic.
The South Pole Traverse (or highway) begins at McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea, straight to the Antarctic Point with a total length of 1600 km.
The snow was hardened, the gaps were filled and flagged. Only specialized tractors and sleds with fuel and supplies could be reached.
The car is not very flexible, so it must be rounded through the Antarctic mountains, turning a long bending to reach the plateau.
The most common accidents in winter are due to the wetness of roads and roadways (walks), especially steps.
At least you need suitable shoes on the bottom of your shoe. Walking in ice and snow is usually very slippery, even some winter boots are not enough.
Shoes should be deep enough, at 5 mm (1/5 inch) or above; the material should be soft enough at low temperatures.
Some boots have shoe nails; there are also extended equipment designed for wet and slipped road surfaces with shoe nails, suitable for most shoes and boots, can be mounted on the heels or at the same time on the heels and soles.
The heel should be low and wide. Smears, sandstones or salt particles (calcium chloride) are often sprinkled on the road to increase friction.
Avalanche is not an anomalous phenomenon; the amount of snow that can be accommodated on steep slopes is limited, and excess snow falls in the form of avalanche.
The problem is that the snow has a very strong stickiness. So some triggers are needed to get down, while a little snowfall may also trigger other snowfalls.
Sometimes the initial trigger is because the sun warms the snow, sometimes because of more snowfall, sometimes because of other natural events, but more common causes are often human factors.
Tornado is a rotating airflow column with very low pressure, which can inhale the surrounding air inside and upward.
Tornadoes produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) that can throw heavy objects into the air and hold them moving forward.
At first, the funnel clouds stretched downward from the thunderstorm clouds and turned into a tornado when they touched the ground.
Individual VPN (virtual private network) programs are excellent tools to circumvent political censorship and commercial IP geofiltration.
They are superior to web agents for the following reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just hypertext transfer protocol (http) content.
They usually provide higher bandwidth and better services.They are encrypted and harder to monitor.
Media companies routinely lied to cover their purpose, claiming it was for "preventing piracy."
In fact, the regional code has no effect on illegal copying; a one-by-one disk copy can be played smoothly on any device that can play the original disc.
The goal is actually to make these companies better control their markets; everything is about clapping money.
Because calls are routed through the Internet, you don't have to use a call company located in your place of residence or travel.
Whether to get local numbers in the habitable community is not required; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the wild of Alaska's Chiggin, and then select a number that shows you are in sunny Arizona.
Many times you have to buy a single number that can be used worldwide in order to receive calls from the Public Exchange Telephone Network (PSTN). The source of this number has a great impact on the main caller.
Real-time text translation applications: Applications that can automatically convert the entire stream of text from one language to another.
Some such applications even allow users to translate their smartphones against signs or other objects in the real world, and they can translate foreign language text above.
The translation engine has made significant improvements and now often provides more or less correct translations (and more cases are rarely murmuring), but it's worth noting that they may still be completely wrong.
One of the most outstanding such applications is Google Translate. After downloading the required language data, it can perform offline translations.
When traveling abroad, using a smartphone GPS navigation app may be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate.
This is a way to save more money than buying maps with GPS or separate GPS devices, or renting one from car rental companies.
If your phone doesn't have a data connection or isn't in service, the performance of your phone may be limited or you can't use it.
Each street store is filled with a row of dazzling prepaid phone cards that can be used either for public pay phones or for ordinary telephones.
While most phone cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some cards have special offers when making calls to a particular country.
These services are usually available by calling a phone number, and most of the calls can be made free of charge.
The rules governing regular photography also apply to video recordings, and perhaps even more.
If you don't even allow photos, let alone want to shoot videos.
If you use drones, please carefully confirm in advance what can be photographed and what licenses or additional licensees are required.
Manipulating drones to air around the airport or crowded places is a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Now very few people do not search and compare prices first, just book tickets directly through the airline.
Sometimes, the price of the same flight on different information gathering sites may vary greatly, it is good to compare search results before booking and at the same time look at the airline's own website.
While travel or business trips do not require visas for short-term visits to certain countries, the time spent by foreign students is usually longer than leisure travellers.
Typically, long stays in foreign countries require a visa beforehand.
Student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures compared to general tourist or business visas.
In most countries you need a letter of admission to the school you want to attend, as well as a document proving that you have at least the funding required for your first year's course.
Consult the school and the immigration department of the country you want to study for details.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad generally requires paying income tax to the country in which it is located.
Different countries, the structure of income taxes is different, and there are also great differences in rates and tax tiers.
Some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, impose federal and local income taxes, so tax rates and grades may vary by region.
When returning to their home country, there is usually no need for an inbound check or just a form of walking, but it can be difficult to pass through customs.
Make sure to know what can be carried, not carry and declare any items beyond the law.
The easiest way to start traveling writing is to hone your skills on a senior travel blog site.
After familiarizing yourself with online typography and editing, you can create your own website.
Volunteering in travel is a great way to be unique, but it's not just about paying.
Living abroad and volunteering is a good way to understand different cultures, meet new friends, learn about yourself, exercise the ability to judge correctly, or even acquire new skills.
It's also a good way to save money and stay somewhere for longer, as many volunteer jobs provide lodging and some work with a small amount of pay.
Vikings use Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes are still available today. To confirm whether special permits are required, those licenses may be difficult to apply.
The Bering Strait connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg with most of its rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it can be reached from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Please be assured that after arriving at the dock, everything will go smoothly. You will meet other people who are going to take a boat and they will share information with you.
Basically, you can post adverts to inform others that you can provide help, walk back and forth on the dock, contact people who are cleaning the yacht or sailors in the bar etc.
Try to chat with as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and they will prompt you which boat is looking for someone.
You must be careful to select the "flying regular" airlines in the league.
While you may think that it's natural to have a member of which airline is on the most number of flights, you should know that there are often different interests offered by carriers and that other airlines under the same league might give back more frequent flyer points.
Carrierships such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa by providing routes to many major cities in Africa with more competitive prices than other European airlines.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has reached 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have a lot of travel time, see the comparison of total fare to Africa with global fare.
For all regions outside Africa, don't forget to add additional visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation and so on.
If you only want to fly around the world in the southern hemisphere, there are very few options for flights and destinations because trans-oceanic routes are scarce.
None of the routes in the Southern Hemisphere can cross all three oceans (the SkyTeam does not even have trans-oceanic routes).
However, the Star Alliance covers all routes across the globe, except for South-East Pacific routes from Santiago in Chile to Tahithi Island, which is one of the world's largest airlines at LATAM.
If you don't want to cross the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, there are other options besides this flight.
In 1994, the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan launched a war against Azerbaijanis.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic was born; however, it had not been formally recognized by any country, including Armenia.
Diplomatic strife in the region continues to deteriorate relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal area (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century old town around Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
Due to its unique cultural and historical value, the entire region is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, which ranks among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, originally intended as five plots of land, consists of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, five coastal villages located in the Liguria region of Italy.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have carefully built terraces in rugged and steep terrain, stretching to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Its charm is partly due to the lack of obvious business development. Villages are connected by roads, trains and boats so that they cannot be driven from outside.
French languages used in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from French, although very similar to French.
In particular, the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland have some nuanced specificities on the digital system, which are slightly different from those spoken in France.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French at school, so they can understand even if you use the standard French measurement system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly expression that means "hello."
However, in Malaysia, at least among Malays in rural areas, this gesture is similar to flipping their fingers toward their bodies in some Western countries, saying "come here," and the gesture is used only to express that meaning.
Similarly, when waving to say goodbye, the British tourists in Spain may mistakenly assume that this is a gesture of inviting people back if they are holding their hands toward the waving themselves (rather than towards those who want to wave).
The auxiliary language is an artificial or constructive language created to facilitate the communication of people whose languages are incomparable.
They differ from common languages, which are a natural or progressive language that is the main means of communication among other language users for various reasons.
During the hottest day, travelers can experience the illusion of water (or something else) - a mirage.
Travellers chasing the mirage would be dangerous because it was a waste of valuable energy and surplus water.
Even the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night. Without warm clothes, low thermostat is a real risk.
Especially in summer, if you decide to hike through the rainforest, you need to be careful with mosquitoes.
If you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, just a few seconds of open doors when you get inside your car is enough for mosquitoes to dig in with you.
Avian influenza, or more formally called the "fowl epidemic cold," can infect both birds and mammals.
Human cases of avian influenza are reported to be less than a thousand, but some of them are fatal.
Most cases come from people who deal with poultry, but birdwatchers also have some risk.
Norway's typical landscape is steep fjords and valleys that suddenly turn into tall, low-lying plateaus.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde", meaning a vast, open, treeless space that is an immense area.
In Roggarland and Agde, they are commonly referred to as "hei", meaning the wilderness without trees, usually full of Shinan.
Glaciers are not stable, but flow from the mountains. This can lead to cracks and ice rifts that may be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice cave may collapse, cracks may close.
On the edge of the glacier, huge ice cubes will loosen, fall, and perhaps jump or roll farther from the edge.
The tourist peak of the summer-time area in the mountains is usually a summer in India.
However, in winter there is a different kind of beauty and charm, with the amount of snow from many summer-time resorts in the mountains fittingly. These places offer activities such as skiing and skateboarding.
Only a handful of airlines have tossed the price for their deceased relatives, which is slightly cheaper than an occasional trip to the funeral.
Airlines that offer such ticket prices include Canadian Airways, Delta Airways, German Lufthansa (flights from the United States or Canada) and WestJet Airways.
Whatever the case may be, you have to call directly for a ticket to the airline.
He added: "We now have 4 months old mice without diabetes, but they've ever had the disease."
Dr. Ehud Ur (Professor of Medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, New Scotland, and Professor of Clinical Sciences at the Canadian Diabetes Association) reminds us that this study is still in its early stages.
Like other experts, he is skeptical of how diabetes can be cured. He points out that these findings are unrelated to people who already have type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sarah Daniels, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Literary Council, announced to the public in a broadcast on Radio Sweden that the Committee had given up its attempts to contact him for failing to reach directly with Bob Dylan, notifying him of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.
"At the moment, we remain unmoved. I have phoned and sent emails to his best collaborators and received very friendly responses from each other."
Earlier, Ring CEO Jamie Siminov said that at the beginning of his founding he could not hear a doorbell ring in his studio in the garage.
He said he made a WiFi doorbell.
Siminov said the company's sales surged in 2013 after he appeared on "Smart Winners", when the group refused to invest in the startup.
In late 2017, Siminov appeared on the QVC TV sales channel.
Ring also reached an out-of-court settlement in a lawsuit with rival ADT security company.
While there is an experimental vaccine that seems to be able to reduce the mortality rate of Ebola, so far no drug has been definitively proven suitable for treating existing infections.
A "antibody cocktail" called ZMapp is initially expected to play a role in this area, but official research shows that it has some unsatisfactory effects on preventing death.
In the PALM experiment, ZMapp is used as a reference. That is, scientists use it as a baseline to compare the other three treatments with them.
The American Gymnastics Association supports the IOC's letter and accepts the strict requirements of the Olympic family to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the IOC statement that, rather than revoking our licenses, it is better to continue promoting meaningful change within our organization and may be more conducive to safeguarding the interests of athletes and clubs and their movements.
According to an independent survey supported by the American Gymnastics Association, we may be able to learn why the mass sexual assault of Larry Nassar, who was bravely exposed by survivors, has not been detected for so long. In addition, the association said that necessary and appropriate corrections would be made.
The American Gymnastics Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee have a common goal: to ensure as much as possible the safety of gymnastics and other sports, allowing athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, active and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Buzezinski first worked for John Ford Kennedy as his advisor and later for Lyndon Baynes Johnson's government.
During the 1976 presidential election, he offered Carter foreign policy advice and then replaced Henry Kissinger as a national security adviser from 1977 to 1981.
As a national security adviser, he assisted Carter in dealing with many international affairs such as the signing of the Camp David Agreement in 1978; normalization of U.S.-China relations at the end of the 1970s; Iran's revolution leading to the hostage crisis in 1979; and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

Later on Sunday, US President Donald Trump issued a statement through the press secretary announcing that U.S. troops would evacuate Syria.
Trump made a statement after talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkey will also take over custody of the arrested Islamic State militants; European countries have refused to repatriate them.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs have feathers - a theory which has been widely circulated - but also provides details that fossils typically cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the animal's feathers are chestnut brown at the top, and the bottom is light or carrot color.
This discovery also helps to gain insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs don't have a well-developed mainstay - which is called the "feather shaft", but there are other characteristics of feathers, such as feather and small branches, researchers infer that the evolution of feather shafts may be later than these other features.
The structure of feathers indicates that they are not used to fly, but to regulate temperature or show off. The researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows mature feathers rather than feathers from pups.
The researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the samples show adult feathers rather than plues from early dragons.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gazantep, Turkey, which killed two policemen and injured more than 20 others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were policemen.
Police said they suspected an Islamic State (ISIL) militant had launched the attack.
They found that the sun and other stars are operating in the same way: The activity of all stars in a galaxy is entirely determined by their brightness and rotation.
The Rosbeth number of a star is determined by its lightness and ripples, associated with plasma flow.
The smaller the number of Rosbeths, the less active the stars are in their magnetic field reversals.
On the way, Yamazaki encountered troubles on many occasions.
He was looted by pirates, assaulted by wild dogs in Tibet, escaped from marriage in Nepal and also arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard is available at both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
It can be backward compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g provided that the base station has two radios.
802.11n is much faster than previous technology, with maximum theoretical throughput up to 600 Mbit/s.
Duval is married, with two grown-up children, and he doesn't impress the storyteller Miller too much.
When asked to comment, Miller said: "Mike said a lot at the hearing...I was preparing for it then so I didn't understand what he was saying."
"By 2020, we will work to make the emissions of CO2 per unit of GDP significantly lower than in 2005," Hu said.
He did not set a cut, but only said that the amount would be determined based on China's economic output.
Hu Jintao encourages developing countries to "do not revisit the old path of pollution and governance."
He added, "However, they should not be required to assume obligations beyond their development stage, responsibility and capacity."
The Iraqi team presented its report at 12:00 on Greenwich Time (GMT) today.
The report warns that no action currently being taken in Iraq can deter sectarian wars, growing violence or tumultuous movements.
The report begins by calling for an open debate and consensus on Middle East policy.
The report harshly criticizes almost every aspect of the administration's current policy towards Iraq and urges immediate change of direction.
Among the 78 recommendations of this report, the first was to take new diplomatic action by the end of the year aimed at protecting Iraq's borders from hostile forces and re-establishing diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries.
Current Senator, Argentina's First Lady Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced his presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, 50 km (31 mi) from Buenos Aires.
Ms. Kisner announced her intention to take part in the presidential campaign at the Grand Theatre in Argentina, and was also here in 2005, where she began running for senators as a representative of Buenos Aires province.
The debate began because of controversy over relief and reconstruction spending after Hurricane Katrina; some fiscal conservatives humorously called it "the Bush New (Orlean) government."
Liberals' critique of reconstruction efforts has focused primarily on the practice of awarding redevelopment contracts as insiders in Washington.
More than 4 million people went to Rome for funerals.
There were too many attendees for the funeral in St. Peter's Square, so it was impossible for everyone to enter.
Several large television screens were installed throughout Rome for people to watch the ceremony.
Similar facilities have been set up in many other cities in Italy and elsewhere in the world, particularly Poland, for mass viewing.
Historians criticised the FBI's past policy, which would focus resources on vulnerable cases, particularly car burglaries, with the aim of increasing the agency's success rate.
Congress funded the yellowing initiative from fiscal 2005 and stipulated that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) must appoint 10 investigators to specifically fight adult pornography.
Robin Uthappa scored the highest score in the tournament, scoring 11 quarters and 2 six points, with only 41 goals winning 70 points.
The midfielder Sachin Tandurka and Rahul Dravid performed well, with the partner achieving 100 runs.
But after the captain lost three pillar doors, India only scored 36 points at the end of the game and lost seven pillar doors.
President George W. Bush arrived in Singapore on the morning of November 16, beginning a week-long trip to Asia.
He was welcomed by Singapore's deputy prime minister, Huang Cheng, and discussed trade and terrorism issues with Prime Minister Li Xinglong of Singapore.
After a week of midterm elections, Bush told audiences about the expansion of trade in Asia.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper, after a 25-minute meeting in his office with New Democratic leader Jack Layton, has agreed to refer the government's Clean Air Act to a multiparty committee for review before being read twice.
"Layton asked during a meeting with the prime minister to amend the Conservative environmental bill, and he called for 'completely rewriting' the Conservative environmental bill."
Since the federal government intervened to take over funds from Mersey Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania, the state government and some federal lawmakers have criticized the move as a gimmick ahead of the November federal election.
But Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the bill was only intended to prevent hospital facilities from being degraded by the Tasmania government by extra $45 million.
The latest communique shows that sea level readings indicate a tsunami has occurred. Tsunami events are accurately recorded near the islands of Pagopago and Niue.
Tonga did not report any significant loss or casualties, but the electricity was temporarily interrupted. The power outage reportedly made it impossible for Tonga authorities to receive a tsunami alert from the Pacific Tsunami Alert Center (PTWC).
Although the alerts have been lifted, 14 schools located on or near the Hawaiian coastline were closed throughout Wednesday.
President George W. Bush supported the announcement.
George W. Bush spokeswoman Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's commitment "an important step toward achieving a verifiable denuclearization goal on the Korean peninsula."
The subtropical storm Jerry is formed today in the Atlantic, the tenth named storm during the Atlantic hurricane season.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that "Jerry" has no threat to land.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimated that 6 inches of rain could have plummeted before damaged dams.
When Hurricane Katrina hit, the level of flooding in District 9 was once as high as 20 feet, due to the nearby floods have been submerged, and the current level has reached a deep depth.
In a 100-foot wide river section, the water is about to spill out of the dam.
Shared Resource Administrator Adam Cuerden expressed his dissatisfaction with the deletion of related content in an interview with Wikinews last month.
"He lied to us from the beginning. First, he behaved as if it were for legal reasons. Secondly, he pretended to listen to our opinions and then removed them directly."
Due to indignation, policies are currently being drafted on the site's sexual content, which has millions of media licensed for public communications.
Most of the work done is theoretical, but the purpose of the program was to simulate observations of human constellations.
The effect the team is looking for may be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Like the moon exerting traction on Earth, causing tides, the galaxy also exerts a force on human constellation galaxies.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
The theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is in some kind of aura around it, made up of many small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke has erupted from the factory.
The local government warned residents near the nuclear power plant to stay indoors, turn off air conditioning and not drink tap water.
Japan's IAEA said the nuclear power plant detected radioactive substances of cesium and iodine.
The authorities speculated that this indicates that the containers where uranium fuels are stored on site may have been ruptured and are leaking.
Dr. Tony Mor discovered this widespread drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in the province of Quazauru-Natal, South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and worrying because of its very high death rates."
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have been infected with germs in the hospital, and at least two of them are hospital caregivers.
Within a year, an infected person may infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the proportion of broadly drug-resistant TB as a whole appears to remain low; in South Africa, only 6,000 people were infected at any given time.
Both more than 1,000 pounds of satellites fly at speeds of 17,500 miles per hour and collide over 491 miles from Earth.
Scientists say the explosion caused by this collision is huge.
They are still working to determine the magnitude of this impact and its impact on Earth.
The U.S. Department of Defense Strategic Command is tracking the wreckage.
The results of the mapping analysis will be published on the public web.
Ohio authorities said the doctor, who worked at the Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, would face serious murder charges for finding his mother body in a doctor's car trunk on Wednesday.
Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found in Bruyash, a suburb just 15 miles north of Cincinnati, Ohio, when she was found wearing T-shirts and underwear, lying on the side of the road looking to take a lot of drugs.
She instructed the officers to look at her black Ozmobil Passion car, which was parked 500 feet away.
There, they found the body of 53-year-old Saroja Bara Subramannia covered with bloody blankets.
Police said the body appeared to be laid there for about a day.
The first cases of this season were reported in late July.
Pigs carry the disease and then pass through mosquitoes to humans.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as placing pig hunters in severely infected areas, sending thousands of mosquito nets and spraying pesticides.
The government has also pledged millions of doses of encephalitis vaccines, which will help medical institutions prepare for next year.
Due to a lack of funding and low priority over other diseases, the plan to provide vaccines for the worst-hit areas in history this year has been postponed.
In 1956, Slania moved to Sweden. Three years later he began working at the Swedish Post Office and became chief stamp engraver.
He has produced more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and other 28 countries.
His work is highly discernible, with high quality and rich details, making him one of the few "home-known" figures among philanthropists.
"His 1000th postage stamp, produced in 2000, was drawn from David Clock Elenstrall's famous painting The Great Performance of the King of Sweden and thus selected for Guinness World Records."
He has also been involved in the production of banknote engravings in many countries, including a new Canadian 5- and 100-dollar portrait of the prime minister.
After the accident, Gibson was sent to the hospital, but soon he murmured.
The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in a car accident.
On the same day, at about 12:00 Greenwich time (GMT), the vehicle was dragged away from the scene of the accident.
A staff member at a garage near the accident said: "The children are waiting for the road and screaming loudly, crying endlessly."
They all ran back from where the accident happened.
Other issues on the agenda of the Bali Conference include saving the world's existing forests and sharing technologies to help developing countries develop in less polluting ways.
The United Nations also hopes that a fund will be finalized to help the countries concerned cope with the effects of global warming.
These funds can be used to build flood-proof homes, improve water management and promote crop diversification.
Frowker wrote that some people tried to suppress women's voices about women's health problems, but they were willing to do so.
She came to this conclusion because of the positive evaluation and encouragement given to her by many men and women, who struggled to advocate that contraceptives should be treated as medical necessities.
After the wounded were sent to the hospital, the fight calmed down and the remaining approximately 40 prisoners stayed in the courtyard and refused to return to their cells.
The negotiators tried to reverse the situation, but the demands of prisoners were unclear.
Between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. during the summer hours of the mountains, convicts in the courtyard sparked a fire.
Soon, police officers equipped with anti-riot equipment entered the courtyard and forced prisoners to walk uninstructed by tear gas.
Firefighters eventually extinguished the fire at 11:35 p.m.
After the dam was built in 1963, seasonal floods were controlled and sediments no longer scattered into rivers.
This sediment is a necessary condition for the formation of sandy oases and beaches, while sandy oases and beaches are the habitats of wildlife.
As a result, two fish are extinct and two other fish are endangered, including bow slag.
While the level of water will only rise a few feet after flooding, officials hope it is enough to restore the eroded sandy continent downstream.

All the cave entrances (which are called "Seven Sisters") are at least 100 to 250 meters in diameter (328 to 820 feet).
Infrared images show that changes in day and night temperatures indicate these places are likely to be caverns.
"They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surfaces, and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on Earth, which typically maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are very similar to those of underground deep holes," said Glen Cushing, NASA's Space Geological Survey (USGS) team at Arizona Flagpole Town and North Arizona University.
In France, traditionally voting is an experience of little technical content: voters enter a small compartment and put a preprinted paper that shows the candidate's choice in an envelope.
After the official verifyes the identity of the voter, the voters will enclose the envelope into the ballot box and sign it on the ballot list.
France's electoral law enacts quite strict regulations for the election process.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can see no envelopes in the box at the beginning of the vote, and there is no other person who puts an envelope into the box except those who are promptly counted and entitled to vote.
Candidates can be dispatched to see every aspect of the electoral process on the ground. At night, volunteers check in accordance with specific procedures under strict supervision.

United Nations peacekeepers arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, and they were blamed for the spread of the epidemic.
Proceedings show that the failure of the United Nations camp to properly disinfect wastes has led to bacteria entering the tributaries of the Atibonite River, one of Haiti's largest rivers.
Before the army arrived, Haiti had never encountered problems related to the disease since the early 19th century.
Independent research cited by the Haitian Institute for Justice and Democracy indicates that Nepal's United Nations peacekeeping forces have unwittingly brought the disease to Haiti.
Danielle Lantagne, a United Nations expert who studies the disease, said the outbreak is likely caused by peacekeepers.

Gold can be processed into various shapes. It can be scrolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into filaments, used for wringing and stitching. It can also be beaten or crushed into pieces.
It can be made very thin, sticky on other metals, and because it reaches so thin, sometimes can be used to decorate hand-drawn drawings in books called "color captions."
This is known as the pH value of chemical substances. You can use red gantry juice to make an indicator.
The color of the cabbage juice will change according to the acidic and alkaline nature of the chemical.
The pH value is expressed by the number of hydrogen (H) ions in a chemical being measured.
Hydrogen ions are the protons that have lost electrons (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then rub them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hand reacts to the outer layer, which forms a layer of shell-like stuff that feels very interesting.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are almost every home in the two cities that have pumped toilets connected to sophisticated sewage treatment systems.

Ancient Egypt, Persia and China also have toilets. In Roman civilisation, toilets are sometimes part of a mixed public bathroom for men and women.
You call people far from a thousand miles away, and you'll use the satellite.
Satellites in space were almost immediately repulsed by phone calls.
Satellites were launched into space by rockets. Scientists used telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorted some light and vision.
To send satellites or telescopes into space, a giant rocket that is more than 100 feet tall will be needed.
Wheels have changed the world in incredible ways. Wheels are our greatest contribution to making our traffic easier.
With it, we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below are more medium-sized cats, and they eat medium-sized prey from rabbits, antelopes to deer.
Eventually, there are many small cats (including dispersed pet cats) fed with much larger numbers of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the Liki concept, each cat responsible for a special job that prevents them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most obvious cat species of habitation, living in large groups called lion populations.
The lion group consists of one to three adult males who have only relatives, as well as up to thirty females and pups.
As sisters and daughters in a large family, females usually have close relationships with each other.
The behavior of the lions is very similar to that of the wolves or dogs. These animals are remarkably similar to those of the lions (but unlike other large cats), and they are also deadly for their prey.
Tiger is an all-powerful athlete who climbs (although climbing isn't very strong), swims and jumps away, and pulls up to five times as much as a human valiant.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars belong to the same type (the leopard genus). These four big cats are the only cat that can be roared.
The tiger's roar is not as deep as the lion's roar, but more like a whirling word.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions allow, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. The leopard cat's prey is almost much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that the leopard cat tracks and searches for animals to hunt by scenting and sniffing trails on the ground.
Their night vision is powerful and visible in the dark, and their actions are secretive. The leopard cat's way of preying is to first integrate into the surrounding environment and then rush toward the prey.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) is separated from their original main populations (such as crossing mountains and rivers, or arriving at a new island so that it can't easily go back), they usually find themselves in an environment different from the previous ones.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptability to become a strong competitor rather than those they previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
Over time, new populations began adapting to the new environment and they began to become less and less similar to other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations eventually look very different so that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process "species formation" - the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of evolution.
Plants can make the oxygen inhaled by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide emitted by humans.
Plants use photosynthesis to obtain nutrients from sunlight. They also provide a shade.
Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Cang Dragon was the top predator of that era, and he feared nothing but his class.
Its long jaws are full of more than 70 sharp teeth, and there is a row on the upper jaw. This means that anything that meets it has no way to escape.
Its tongue may be forked, and we're not sure about it. Its food includes sea turtles, large fishes, other cramps, and even eats people.
It will attack anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the tsarosaurus are not its opponents.
Although most of the Romans' food is common to us, they do have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild pigs, canopies, snails and a rodent called hazel sleeping rats.
Another difference is that the poor and women are sitting in chairs for dinner, while the rich like to gather together for a banquet and sit on their side.
Foods flowing into Europe from the Americas or Asia centuries later could not appear in the ancient Roman diet.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa or any ancient Romans had eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods and regarded it as the abode of God.
People will give sacrifices to God, and pastors will meet the needs of God through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has a courtyard open to the outside, and an inner temple that can only be accessed by priests.
Some of the special towers are pyramidal in shape, known as Golden Literary Towers, which were built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is God's special holy place.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not so important.
The majority of the Jewish family's life is spent outdoors.
Women cook in the yard; shops are actually open counters facing the streets. They use stones to build houses.
Canaan has no large forests, so the wood is very expensive.
Greenlandic people are scarce. According to the Nordic epic Saga, Red Beard Erik was expelled from Iceland for murder, and he sailed westward to discover land so that it was named Greenland.
But no matter what he found, the Eskimo people were already living there.
Although all belong to "Scannavia", there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasures, you might think a treasure trove would be painted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not the case. Although some things are written on the back of this document, it is not a treasure trove.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776 (original version of the Declaration of Independence, 4 July 1776)" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one can determine who the author is, this large-scale parchment paper document (size 293/4 inches multiplied by 241/2 inches) allegedly was rolled back and stored at the time it was just written.
Therefore, it is likely that this symbol is simply added as a label.
Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still unliberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 not to resist the invaders but to cooperate with them.
On August 15, 1940 the Allies invaded southern France and this attack was called Operation Dragon Cavalry.
In just two weeks, the U.S. and Free French armies liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a one-size-fits-all culture shared by people who live together and work together (the society).
The term "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis" (meaning "citizens") and is related to the Latin words "civis" (meaning "citizens") and "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city state"), which in some way defines the scale of society.
The urban state is a precursor to the nation. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the traces of culture lingering and the spread of culture can be fair.
Ethnic minority cultures often disappear without the relevant historical evidence, and are not considered as decent civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially formed a weak central government under federal regulations (the Congress is its only component).
Congress has no tax authority, and because there is no state administration or judiciary, Congress can only rely on the state government to enforce all bills, which are often uncooperative.
It also has no power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These provisions must be amended with the unanimous consent of all states, which treat central government attitudes so slowly that their state representatives are often absent.
Italy's national football team and Germany's national soccer team are the second-largest teams in the world to win a World Cup title in 2006.
Popular sports projects include football, basketball, volleyball, water ball, swordsmanship, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, round-casket hockey and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians will participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being the island of China), making it the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Due to the large number of Japanese island masses, Japan is often referred to as "Lake Island" from a geological point of view.
Western understanding of Taiwan can be traced back to the 15th century. The European sailors who traveled at that time named the island "Ilha Formosa", meaning a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwest Taiwan and began to change the way indigenous food was produced and hired Chinese workers to work at its rice and sucrose plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan; in 1885, the Great Qing Empire announced that it would establish a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat of the Midnight War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Maguan Treaty, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The city of Makhu Picchu consists of three main buildings, namely Intihuatana, Sun Temple and Three Window House.
In order to give tourists a better understanding of the original appearance of the complex, most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been repaired and the restoration work continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is a 35mm format, which is the film size dominant at the end of the film era.
Production still exists today, but more importantly its length and width ratio is applied to the formatting of digital camera image sensors.
The actual dimensions of the 35 mm format are 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is actually a bit confusing.
Therefore, the wide ratio of this format (by 12 getting the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats, such as the APS format series, are identical or quite close to this long and wide ratio.
The often misused and ridiculed sequential method is not lost to creating dynamic as a simple guiding method, but also keeps the image orderly.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is the intersection of a line which divides the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period of European history, the already rich and powerful Catholic Church has been closely monitored.
Although the languages and customs of European countries vary, Christianity has linked them together for over a thousand years.
From the king to the civilian population, its power strewn across the ten sides affects everyone.
One of the main creeds of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the Church's monetary fund was specifically established for this purpose.
Church centralism has existed in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they have complied with the creed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a maritime blockade on Germany.
They cut off vitally important military and civilian supplies, which proved to be effective, even though such a blockade violated universally accepted international law under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain is mined in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire sea, and even poses a threat to ships of neutral states.
Due to the limited response to this strategy, Germany expects its unrestricted submarine warfare to have a similar response.
In the 1920s, mainstream attitudes of most citizens were pacifist and separatist.
After witnessing the scourge and brutality of World War I, all countries were eager to avoid repeating the same.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at New York's Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
The different periods of ancient China are distinct; each period in China or every reigning family is a distinct dynasty.
Similarly, the period of successive successions was an era of instability in which small countries were separated. The most famous one was the 60-year three-nation period between Hanjin and his two generations.
During these turbulences, fierce wars were fought against the throne.
The three countries are one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people have died fighting for the highest power of Xi'an luxury palaces.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of measure units, the transition from tyranny to republicanism, nationalism, belief that the state belongs not to the sole ruler but to the people.
In addition, after the revolution, official positions were open to all men, which gave the most aspiring and successful people the opportunity to fly Yellow Tenda.
The army, too, because the high and low ranks are no longer based on rank, but on talent.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside of the world's life. He used to meditate at a cave called Hilla on Mount Noor (Light).
The cave itself, not only survives the test of time, but also brings an extremely vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain in northern Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing its existence is not easy to find. Once it enters the cave, it is completely segregated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and surrounding mountains. In the caverns, sights and sounds of the outside world are hardly visible or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only building that remains unstoppable to date.
The Great Pyramid is a masterpiece of the Egyptians in the third century BC, and it is one of many large pyramids that pay tribute to the late Pharaoh.
The Giza plateau in the valley of Egypt's death (the "Giza pyramid group") consists of several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small graves, several temples and large sphinxes.
The Great Pyramids were built to commemorate Huff's wife and family members, and several smaller pyramids, graves and temples were built for the memory of Huff's wife and family.
The "top bow" symbol is like the letter V, and the "bottom bow" symbol is like nails or lacks a square at the bottom.
Up refers to pushing the bow from the top, down referring to pulling the bow from the back of the bow (i.e. where hands hold the bow).
The bow usually produces a softer voice, while the bow emits a stronger and more steadfast sound.
Please make your own markers with a pencil at will, but keep in mind that the notes printed are musically meaningful so they should usually be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the intimidated King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antowanet and their two children (11-year-old Marie Theresa and 4-year-old Luis Charles), as well as his sister Lady Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris by a group of market women from Versailles.
They returned to Paris on horseback, surrounded by a group of people shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The rioters forced the king and queen to completely open the car's windows.
In the face of a frightened queen, a thug once waved the head of a royal guard who was killed at the Palace of Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime for most of their expenses, as well as interest in bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people's high profits has become a fundamental gain for U.S. imperialism.
To get to know the Templars, you need to understand the background that prompted the establishment of the Templars.
The era of events is often referred to as the medieval period in European history, i.e. during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).
The medieval period was preceded by the early Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which were generally believed to have ended about 1500 years ago.
Technical determinism is a term that encompasses many kinds of ideas in practice, including technological push theory, technical necessity theory, and a strict definition - human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their performance in technology.
Most explanations of technical determinism include two general ideas: first, the development of technology itself has largely transcended cultural or political influences and second, that technology in turn will have an intrinsic "impact" on society which is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, some might say that cars will inevitably promote the development of roads.
However, the construction of a national road network in just a handful of cars is not economically viable and therefore new modes of production are ripe to reduce car ownership costs.
Higher Volkswagen holdings also lead to higher road traffic accidents, which will drive the invention of new medical technologies for repairing wounds.
Romanticism has a strong cultural deterministic character, which stems from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals and over time emerges geographically related customs and cultures that are much better in harmony with where society is located than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is regarded as the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as the center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined in the 12th century, mainly because of the gifts brought by the Crusaders when they returned, such as silk and spices, were more valuable than the Byzantine market offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries.
At first, dressing was deeply influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slowness of cultural exchanges, Western fashion may be 25-30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, Western European people gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advances at that time was the crusade when people began to wear buttons for clothing.
Self-sustained agriculture is an agricultural activity designed to produce only food that meets the needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sustained agriculture is a simple and often organic system that combines local seeds preserved within the ecological zone with crop rotations or other relatively simple technologies to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers are engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production, which is still the case today in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together the same-minded individuals who feel that they are neglected by social standards and cultivate a sense of identity among them.
Given the age, race, class, location and/or gender differences of members, subcultures may be distinctive.
To differentiate subcultures can be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography or multiple factors.
Members of subcultural groups often symbolically use unique styles of acting to show their membership, including fashion clothing, manners and black words.
To illustrate the importance of socialization, one of the most commonly used methods is to take advantage of cases of a few unlucky children who have not been socialized during their growth with the help of adults due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse.
Such children are referred to as "wild children" meaning "wild children". Some wild children are forbidden by people (often their own parents); in some cases, the child is abandoned because of parents' refusal to accept that the child has serious intellectual or physical defects.
Wild children may have experienced serious child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or leaving their homes.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If the wolf child is raised entirely by a non-human animal, his behavior (as far as physical conditions allow) will be very similar to that of the animal, such as showing fear or indifference towards humans.
While project learning methods should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Stent-based teaching is not a method of learning, but a means of assisting people who have just learned to use new computer programs or initiate new projects.
Scaffolding can be done either online or offline, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding teaching, just like the small helper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual support internalization is used in software to question, prompt and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle alone.
Children are fostered for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse or even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is uncultivated, without care and without education.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
The foster care system should provide all the necessities that its native families lack.
The Internet combines the elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add additional dimensionality in terms of purpose and gratification.
For example, "learning" and "communication" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When looking at the audience's response to the site, Ema and Maced (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "continuing relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of the video has led to significant discoveries in interpreting micro表情 (a few milliseconds of facial movement).
Specifically, it is said that a person can be judged whether or not he is lying by correctly interpreting the micro表情.
Oliver Sacks points out in his paper, The President's Speech, that those who are unable to understand language due to brain damage can still accurately judge whether the speaker is sincere.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be the common property of animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two libraries of genetic variation: explicitness and implicitness.
Mutations add new genetic variants, while selection removes mutations from the expressed gene variant pool.
Due to separation and reorganization, variations change back and forth between the two libraries of each generation.
On tropical steppes, primates have a similar human digestive system and existing plant resources are difficult to meet the needs of primates for amino acids.
In addition, failing to do so would have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available phytologic resources should be proteins in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting this protein unless cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
In summary, we should not be surprised if our ancestors' ways of addressing the "protein problem" are no different from those used today by chimpanzees on tropical steppes.
Sleep interruption refers to the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and sleeping after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do, using a relatively quiet alarm clock that lets you wake up without being completely awakened.
If you find yourself resetting an alarm clock when you sleep, you can put the alarm clock on the other side of the room and force yourself to go down to bed and close the alarm clock.
Other options based on biological rhythms include a large amount of drinking fluid before bed (especially water or tea - well-known urinary effects) and forcing yourself to urinate.
The degree of tranquility in a person is contrary to the level of physical and spiritual tension.
The smaller the pressure, the more vigorous the vitality is manifested. Everyone can find absolute calmness and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own nervousness and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been broadened through the universal love of Tajian Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes Kundalini's methods of yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, speeches and visual images.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tian Yoga. By impersonating different gods, purifying energy channels, and activating the wheelholes to achieve enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy of the countries in World War II, which facilitated cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, institutional, procedural and cultural conflicts separated the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, once ally became an enemy and the Cold War began.
The war lasted for 40 years, and the agents fought with real guns on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including in Afghanistan and Cuba.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defensive line had been broken and the only hope left was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize its army.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight and more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered the eastern part of Poland after violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the USSR Polish Non-Violence Treaty and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
To date, shipping is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's task is to ensure that the nation maintains the capacity of transporting personnel and goods while interfering with the ability of the enemy to transport its personnel and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II. Americans try to transport people and goods across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, dominated by U-class submarines, tried to intercept the shipment.
If the Allies were to fail, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as much as Europe's.
The goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time in Iran's Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, eating and using their milk, meat, hair and skin.
Domestic goats are usually grazing on mountains or other pastures, and they are typically taken care of by shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), who are similar to the more widely known shepherds.
Britain built a freighter lane as early as the 16th century.
Although the Mala Orbital Cars were only cobbled by parallel wooden boards, at that time, in terms of slightly bumpy roads, these cars could make the car's horses run faster and pull more.
In the early days, rail pillows were introduced for fixed rail tracks. However, it was gradually realized that if iron plates were placed on a rail track, they would be more solid and effective.
This has become a common practice, but iron sheets can make wooden car wheels wear even worse.
In 1767, the first all-iron orbit came into existence.
The first known way of transport is walking. Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning an erect person), humans began to walk upright.
Their ancestors of the Southern Apes did not have an upright habit of walking.
The phenomenon of bipolarity was discovered in the southern ancient apes fossils between 4.2 million and 3.9 million years ago, although the Chadian Sahelanthropus may have walked with its legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start a more environmentally-friendly life, join environmental campaigns, and even become environmental activists to reduce future disasters to some extent.
In many cases this is similar to symptomatic therapy. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root cause of the problem and eradicate it completely.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes due to scientific and technological advances in humankind, and that overpopulation and man's lavish lifestyle have made the problem even worse.
Handwritten drafts signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thomson were approved by the Continental Assembly on 4 July, after which they were sent to a few blocks away from the John Dunlap printing house for print.
150 to 200 copies were printed overnight, the now well-known Dunlap Broadsides version.
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of the independent hall.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and Washington read the letter to his army in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The remaining 25 Dunlap Broadsides are the earliest available versions of the document. Handwritten manuscripts have not been retained.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survive and have survived to this day, which is what we call "birds."
Many people think they are not dinosaurs because they have feathers and fly.
But there are still many places where birds resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, spawn eggs, and walk with two back legs like the dragon.
Today, almost all of the computers in use are based on information that processes binary encodings.
Binary numbers only make up one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such numbers are called binary numbers, i.e. "bits" in computer terms.
Intoxication in the body may not immediately appear, symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so you can not immediately make a diagnosis.
The most powerful indicator of ingesting poisons may be a container that is opened on the site, containing drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the labels on the poison and get specific first-aid guidelines.
Entomologists use the term "bug" to officially call this category of insects.
This term stems from the familiarity of people with rotten insects, a very adapted insect that is parasitic to humans.
Hunting and bugs are both nestling insects adapted to live in the host's nests or houses.
Around 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in various parts of the United States have become a major neurological disease in young and middle-aged populations.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (which consists of the brain, spinal cord and visual nerves).
The study found that women were twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may choose not to give birth for their own interests or in the interest of their children.
These couples may develop adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, a biological parent terminates his or her right to be a parent so that another couple can raise their child.
The main purpose of science is to find the way the world works through scientific methods, which in fact guide most scientific research.
Experiments are a test that eliminates one or more possibilities hypotheses, but experiments are not the only way to do so. Asking questions and observing can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
The views expressed by Aristotle on issues in all fields of science, including psychology, are one-on-one.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West has detached itself from its roots in Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the physiological rhythms and behavioral rhythms observed by the researchers are often largely dependent on the internal life cycle that is generated through biological clocks and their existence.
Cycle rhythms are not just a simple response to external cyclic signals, which are recorded in most organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining swing devices that can last for a period of time, even without external hints.
Experiments by Hershey and Chase are one of the main indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Helchy and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments, one of which was DNA marking phages with radiophosphonus and the protein labeling phages with radiosulphur.
The mutation has a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells are inherited from the child, while mutations in other cells lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural scenic tourism attracts tourists who are interested in the natural areas and come to see natural scenery, including wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and research ecosystems.
For example, visit, photograph and learn about red gorillas in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive away from small towns to work, and the place where they're leaving on the road and those who slapped their shoulders was exactly where they were.
In this dynamic traffic traverse, everyone somehow connects to and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Today, science shows that such a large-scale carbon economy can no longer keep the biosphere supporting human evolution over the last two million years stable.
Everybody is a part of society and uses the traffic system, and almost everyone complains about the traffic system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about the same level of water quality or bridge collapse.
Why do traffic systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day, is it an incompetent transportation engineer or there are more fundamental reasons?
Traffic flow studies are the movement between drivers and vehicles at two points, as well as the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of vehicles because there are no 100%-determined predictions about drivers' behavior.
Luckily, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, a relationship is established between the following three main features: (1) traffic, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest flying animals in the air. Flying capabilities make them easier to avoid enemies and find food and spouses more effectively.
Most insects have an advantage in folding their wings backwards along the body.
This gives them more space to evade predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristax said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people think he's right, but there are a lot of people who have the opposite opinion; they believe that the solar system is orbiting the Earth and that the sun is also (and even other stars are).
This seems plausible because the Earth doesn't feel like it is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. Its water volume is more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, and some of its segments can be up to six miles in width.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of all rivers in the world.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and comes from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the grand scale and superb construction technology of the Giza Pyramids has never been surpassed.
Ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom marveled at their predecessors' monument of more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in legal texts and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in the country, and Latin is often used for religious rituals.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because these elements can be found in nature in natural forms and are easier to exploit with raw tools.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that everything is made up of one or more of the four elements of earth, water, air and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (the order does not divide): solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, but he also put forward theories that they will turn into new substances which form what we see.
The alloy is basically made of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements belong to metals, silver and gold are of course also metal.
There are also alloys containing a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all things are made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that the number at the end of this sentence can accommodate trillions of atoms.
Therefore, as soon as the pencil came into existence, it became a good heart for many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the position of pencils is getting lower and less used.
People now write information on a computer screen and never have to contact the pens knife.
One can only guess what the end of the keyboard will be when a new product emerges.
The working principle of the fissile atomic bomb is as follows: bringing together an atomic nucleus and many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's kind of like pushing a bulky trolley up the hill. Once again splitting the atomic nucleus, then releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means they are likely to divide in cases where there is little or no stimulus.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layers of the moon are called crusts.
The earth's crust is about 70 km thick and the far side is about 100 km thick.
The crust below the dark surface is thinner, and the crust beneath the high ground is thicker.
Because the earth's crust is thinner, the near side may have more dungeons and lava can easily rise to the surface.
The core of motivational content theory is the search for factors that are identifying or generating interest.
These theories show that when people mature to a certain degree into adulthood, certain needs and/or desires are internalized.
These theories examine why some people want to do what they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do something.
Two popular content theories, Maslow's Demand Level Theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors occur when managers begin to lead past colleagues. One case is that they try to maintain "intimacy" with team members.
This type of manager is difficult to make unpopular decisions, and there are also difficulties in the implementation of disciplinary measures, performance assessment, assignment of responsibility and accountability.
In another extreme case, the person becomes a very different individual than before, feeling that he/she has to change everything the team does and base its results on himself.
After all, leaders have ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of teams.
This behavior often leads to divergences between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but there are also nuanced differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for the corresponding offline team.
They tend to have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams may schedule meetings for different time zones, and local management may not understand this.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"Unseen Teams" refers to the management team each member has to report to it. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take so long for an organization to build a learning organization?One of the goals of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and originality occur when all available resources are effectively harnessed between the functions of an organization.
Therefore, in a joint effort to overcome obstacles, an organization often brings new innovative processes to meet the needs of its customers.
Before organizations can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge and conduct organized learning.
Angels (2006) interprets the continuum program as a way to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence of the theoretical methods of cognitive research. As a result, it narrows the scope and makes the study more precise.
Relevance between brain pathology and behavior can support scientists' research.
We've known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors can affect human behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study the structure and working processes of the brain, which have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand how the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong sci-fi color, but it's really a very important branch of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and customer problems, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face functions.
All of these have become independent disciplines and focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, with some home computers and video game software applications already having built-in AI systems.
Field visits are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers will be happy to take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Virtual field trips are high-tech solutions. Students can watch the museum's artifacts in class, visit the aquarium, or enjoy fine artwork.
The sharing of field trips in a virtual fashion is also a good way to revisit the trip and share experiences with subsequent classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their state offices every year. The site is redesigned each year, but older versions are saved online as clipbooks.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although the grammar and spelling used by students when they begin to write blogs tend to be troubling, the appearance of readers usually changes this situation.
Students are often the most discerning readers, so bloggers start working hard to improve their writing levels and avoid criticism.
In addition, bloggering also "forces students to have more insight into the world around them." To satisfy audience interests, students are inspired by this and become smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond traditional schooling.
"Appropriate use of blogs" can make students better at analyzing and thinking; by actively responding to online materials, students can find their position in the context of other articles and be able to present their views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the capital of Canada, charismatic and bilingual, highlighting a series of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
To the south is Niagara Falls, to the north are unexplored natural beauty of the Muskoka River and opposite the river.
All of this makes Ontario a typical example of Canada as foreigners think.
The vast areas of the north are sparsely populated, and some places are unsmoked wildernesses.
A surprising set of demographic data comparisons: African-Americans living in the U.S. are more numerous than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island to date, and remains an independent continent for wildlife.
The smaller islands are mostly independent states, or belong to France, and they are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this land, a doctrine prevalent in the Comoros and the States of Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India.
The north is bordered by the Sahel region; the south and west are in the Atlantic.
Women: It is recommended that regardless of the actual marital status, all female tourists should declare themselves married.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassing; and it is not uncommon for people to follow, grab their arms.
Rejecting men must be firm and don't be afraid to stick to their position (resolutely repudiated regardless of the difference in culture!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen, was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenid, formerly known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, also named Casa Branca, until after the earthquake of 1755.

Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the easternmost side of the country and close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Niragongo Volcano. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially in its center.
While Goma is safe, a pre-trial investigation should be carried out to any place outside Goma in order to understand whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has eased.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can visit Goma on Boda-boda (rented motorcycles). The normal (local) price of a short drive is CFA 500.

Guarani, the most important indigenous group living in the present-day East Paraguay region, lives on semi-nomadic hunting and self-sufficient agricultural activities.
Chaco is home to other indigenous tribes, such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who depend on hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay in the 16th century, once known as the "Great Indian Province", was a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.

The currency of the Falkland Islands is almost impossible to exchange outside the island, so it must be redeemed before leaving the island.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so during winter in the northern hemisphere it is summer and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30degC.
Winter may look colder than it looks like: The temperature is rarely below zero, but when the wind and humidity are combined, it will make people feel cooler than the temperature shown by thermometers.
There are no specific "rainy seasons" and "dry seasons": the rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are commonplace with humans, wildlife is wild after all and we shouldn't feed or disturb them.
At least 100 yards/m of distance to bears and wolves, while all other wildlife require a distance of 25 yards/m!
No matter how gentle it looks, almost all large animals such as wild boars, elk, humpbacks, bears and others are likely to attack humans.
Each year, dozens of tourists are injured by failing to keep the proper distance. These animals are massive, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them some space.
In addition, pay attention to the smell that leads to bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking odorless foods and keep the camp clean.

Anyone who drives or crosses mountains in high latitude areas should take into account the possibility of snowfall, freezing or freezing temperatures.
On the surface of the ice and snow covered, friction is very small, you can't drive like on a clean tarped road.
When snowstorms, the amount of snowfall in a very short time can be enough to trap you.
Snowfall, snow slicking, water beads on the windows or ice may also block sight.
On the other hand, snow-and-ice weather is very common in many countries, and traffic throughout the year will hardly be interrupted.
Hunting is perhaps the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and a highlight of many tourists' journeys.

There are many ways to purify water, some more effective for specific pollution.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it takes a few minutes.
The effect of the filter varies, and if you are concerned about this, then you should consider buying sealed bottled water produced by reputable companies.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their home country.

Contagious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill humans through violence, are usually not among the pests.
Tax-free shopping refers to the opportunity to buy tax-free goods in a particular location.
Travellers travelling to countries where heavy taxes are imposed can sometimes save a large amount of money and buy products such as alcohol and tobacco in these places.
On the Busfaro-Pittsburgh highway, the most challenging conditions for driving are sections between Point Marion and Fairmont, which often pass through remote areas.
If you're not used to driving on a rural road, keep your mind awake: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and quick turns everywhere.
The speed limit that the site advertises is significantly lower than the previous and subsequent road sections, usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour), and strict compliance with the speed limit requirements is more important than other roads.

The stirrup hangs on both sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there are also safety hazards because the rider's feet may be stuck.
If the rider is dumped from right away, but there is a foot card on the stirrup, then the horse may drag him down while running. In order to minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First of all, most horsemen wear boots with horses, and the shoe bottom is smooth and quite narrow.
Secondly, some saddles - especially British saddles - are equipped with safety buttons and if the horseman pulls back, the stirring belt will fall from the saddle.
Chochamo Valley, Chile's preferred mountain destination, is known as Yosemite in South America, with a wide variety of granite large stone walls and cliffs.

High mountain skiing involves ordinary skiing and snowboarding, which is a very popular sport in which the skis or skateboards will be fixed on your feet to slide down from the terrain covered by white snow.
Skiing is a major tourist attraction for many ski enthusiasts who are sometimes referred to as "snow freaks" who plan to ski at some point throughout the holiday.
The idea of skiing is long overdue - a cave murals painted with skiers dating back to 5,000 BC!
As a sport, mountain skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened their first recreational ski club in Australia.
Free skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, ski tourism or ski hiking.
This activity is associated with an Alpine ski trip or mountaineering, but these two activities are usually not carried out. These two activities will take place on steep terrain and require harder skis and boots.
Think of the skiing route as a similar footpath.
When conditions are good, you can go further than walking - but only in very few cases do you get the same speed as skiing on a flat track without heavy backpacks.
Europe is a relatively small area, but has many independent countries on the continent. Typically, traveling across multiple countries means having to undergo multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this regard, however, the Schengen area is somewhat like a country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually pass directly through the border without having to undergo a passport check-up again.
Simultaneously, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money and formalities.
There is no uniform definition of which processed items are antiques. Some tax authorities define items over 100 years as antiques.
The definition is geographically different, and the annual limits of places such as North America may be shorter than that of Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, although the year of handicrafts is much shorter compared to mass-produced similar products.
Reiner husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami. The culture surrounding this industry is also important for many people living in other occupations.

Anyone who plans to travel to countries that may be considered war zones should receive professional training.
Searching on the Internet for an "anti-environment course" may be able to find the address of a local company that provides training.
This course usually covers all the issues discussed here, and is often deepened in a practical warfare experience.
Course training usually lasts 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, first aid training, and sometimes armed training.
Books and magazines about the survival of the wild are common, but there are few publications on the survival of the war zones.
Travellers who plan to undergo transsexual surgery abroad must carry valid documents on their return.

Transformers who have not yet performed surgery had to disclose their privacy when passing the scanner and were unable to guarantee their dignity.
The offshore stream is a rapid reflow of waves from the beach to the sea, usually occurring in reefs or similar places.
Underwater terrain leads to a concentration of reflows in several deeper regions where rushes may form into deep water.
Most of the deaths are due to upside down and physical overruns, and swimming in reverse water is unlikely to succeed.
After getting rid of the turbulent water stream, it was not so difficult to swim back.
Efforts to navigate the places where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skills and whether you have been found).
The impact of returning home is faster than the cultural shock (shorter honeymoon period), longer duration, and may be even more severe.
For travelers who are easily adaptable to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to readapt to their native culture.
After living abroad for a while, you will find that you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of homegrown culture.
When you're just out of the country, people may be patient and well-informed about you because they know that travelers coming to a new country need to adapt.
People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding in their return journeys.
For children, the pyramid's sound and light performance is one of the most interesting events in the region.

The scene is displayed on the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands was discovered in 1819. Several countries claimed sovereignty over the islands, and the archipelagos had the most bases, with sixteen of them in use by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, a settlement in Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island where a still active crater is flooded, providing a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is located in the south of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on the peninsula are incorporated here into the plateau and then reconstituted the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided by Minnesota glaciers.
North, or Sentinal Ridge, boasts Antarctica's tallest mountain of the Vincennes Mountains and peaks at 4892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phone signals are not covered, satellite phones may be your only option.
In general, satellite telephones cannot replace mobile phones because calls can only be made outside the open-air of satellite signals.
The service is often used for shipping, including yachts and expeditions with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide detailed information about the connection to this service.
For those who plan how to spend their short-lived years, travel becomes an increasingly popular choice.

Finland is an excellent sailing sanctuary, with the splendour of "The Country of Thousand Lakes", which also contains thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In the islands and lakes, yachting is not necessary.
The size of the coastal islands and several of the largest lakes is enough to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats and even kayaks can bring a different experience.
Shipbreaking is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one ship out of every seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand also have similar situations but are very unique in other respects (for example, in the Netherlands this figure is 1-40).
Most typical Baltic cruisers will stay in St. Petersburg for a long time.
This means you can have a full time for days to visit this historic city and then go back to bed at night.

Express companies can get high pay for fast delivery of goods. Many times, time is very important for business documents, goods or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but there are problems for other routes and small companies.
If they transport goods in an air-based manner, it may take a few days on certain routes to unload and customs clearance.
The fastest way is to carry it as a checked baggage. According to the airline regulations, luggage for unboarded passengers is prohibited and you need to be present at this time.
The most obvious way to take a first-class or business class is to spend a large amount of money to enjoy this privilege (or, the better way it's to get your company to pay you ride).
However, this is not cheap: according to rough estimates, the business class ticket price may be four times as high as the average economic class, and first-class tickets are more than 11 times higher!
Generally, straight from A to B land, there is no need to find a business or first-class discount ticket.
The airline is very clear that some core passengers are willing to get the privilege of fast and comfortable travel at a high price, so the airline will charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau.The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic afflicted by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of eastern Moldova as a republic along the Transnistrian River that had its own government and currency but was not recognized by any member of the United Nations.
Despite political negotiation failures, economic ties between Moldova and the two regions were reconstructed.
The main religion in Moldova (Moldova) is Orthodox.

Regular broadcasts on the subway are only Catalan, but automatic systems will be temporarily broadcast in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians are famous for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is usually just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to live in Paris remains to be as well behaved as possible, acting like a person with "bien aleve" (well-educated). This makes it much easier for people to participate in social activities.
If you show a little basic politeness, the Parisian rude performance will soon disappear.
Lake Plitvitz National Park is densely forested, with mainly beech, savannah and fir trees characterized by a mix of high mountains and Mediterranean vegetation.

However, people who know a little Spanish may rush to the conclusion that Portuguese is very close to Spanish and do not need to learn separately.
Today, premodern observatories have largely been eliminated and are reserved only as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution during its full-life period is not as severe as it is now, observatories are usually built in urban areas or on campus and are easier to reach than modern observatories.
Most modern scientific telescopes are giant facilities located in remote areas with excellent atmospheric conditions.
Cherry, also known as "hanami", has become a Japanese custom since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China, which is a flower that Chinese people enjoy.
In Japan, the first cherry party was organized by the Emperor for himself and other royal aristocrats.
