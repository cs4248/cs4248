Zhejiang University Academic Annual Meeting Students Sing Leading Song Research Results Open the Mind - china.com
Clean your hands with air, smell your mouth, and search for fog and haze sources Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were honoured.
The main researchers of these results are students.The research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education.The students started from a curious point of view and created many high-end inventions of application value, some of which have won international awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Family Physician
Dr. Zhang Deming, a Ph.D. student at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated on the spot a biosensor at the end of a smartphone that is only half the size of a smartphone.
“You just need to take a slight breath, and the device can test your health from the gas you breathe.”
The sensors are connected to smartphones, and the health report is displayed on the phone after the breath is exhaled, Zhang Deming said.
In the market, intelligent ring can detect the health condition, usually the physical parameters such as temperature, pulse and so on.
The biosensor uses a new material called graphene, which is targeted at chemical elements and is sensitive to the sense of smell, allowing it to reflect health conditions in greater depth and accuracy.
Smart Surgery Lamp: Doctors' High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Swiss International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva this year.
The team of Zhu Lin Yao, a graduate student of the Institute of Optical and Electrical Sciences and Engineering, and Chen Shun Fei opened a new way of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps, and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
“Many diseases cannot be detected and removed early and are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room.”
For example, in early cancer screening, if doctors cannot identify all tumor tissues in time, then cancer cells will continue to spread, Chen said.
This smart surgical lamp has four panels to enhance the differentiation of different tissues under light by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity and shadowlessness of the spots at any time according to the operation needs and personal habits.
This smart surgical lamp has been tested in Zhejiang University Medical School's Shao Ying Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School's Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and received good feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving is cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rub a lot of soap over their heads, and squeeze a lot of detergents, while students such as Lee Kai-chao invented a set of “air washing devices.”
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight will be able to compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap and combines with the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
Colorization and bacterial residue experiments have shown that washing with this method has the same effect as conventional washing methods.
This device relies only on our own gravity as the driver, can guarantee the level of cleaning and save 90% of water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the Second Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention won the only gold award among many of the world's top universities.

A certificate that I think is meaningful - an emergency certificate
This is one of the skills that I think is important in addition to the driving licence!
To spread the word: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of a sudden event, i.e. before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still some time when the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this time that is the most important.
This is a time of urgency.
If I really had a heart attack, brain bleeding, breathing out of control, then the window of our life would only be four minutes, gold four minutes!
So the people around you know how important emergency is!
When someone falls by our side, we can rescue them with professional knowledge, rather than stand there and do nothing, and that feeling of helplessness is terrifying.
"In China, according to our official data, three million people die accidentally every year, the most dangerous of which is a heart attack.
In the U.S., an average of 15 percent can be saved.
Seventy-eight per cent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be saved, and less than one per cent in Shanghai and Beijing.
That's what the first reaction founder Lu said.
If a person has a heart attack, no breathing, no heartbeat, you don't have any effect on the person.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press on the outside of the chest to be able to rescue the person.
I find that very few of us now have the consciousness to learn emergency medicine, but when things happen they can't come when they do, so I appeal to all of us to learn this skill so that we can respond in a timely manner to emergencies.
I don't know if I can save a person's life!
The emergency card can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Centre. I'm registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is of me recording my goals to be accomplished by the age of 25, adding an emergency card to my list of goals a few months ago, but it's done!
Then I'm going to take the other certificates I want to take, I'm going to take a dive certificate, before I see in the little red book another dive emergency certificate, this certificate seems to have to have an emergency certificate to go to the exam, so in fact the emergency certificate is still useful!
I've ordered a number
One of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings!
I never tried it
Why don't you write #NAME#?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG # leaked food, this time just a shrimp dumpling to eat me!?
Because it's obvious that it's effective when I've previously entered the code
First of all, to conclude, I personally think that Four Seas is an all-round crap, in all senses of the word.
But if you're talking about whether or not the film has a bright spot or not, it's not at least a good musical choice.
There are many kinds of bad movies, one that lets you sleep well in the cinema, one that lets you get angry afterwards, and four oceans is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, and it can burn your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han is really a genius.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation of the Crooked novel, unrecognizable, and full of loopholes, like the coat on little Marco.
Even after you've finished, you'll doubt if there's a director's implicit metaphor in it, but when you think about it, it's just a pile of shit.
First of all, let's just say some of the plots are hard for me to understand.
The man's place of residence should be on a small island to the south, and depend on his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snowfall, and the story arranged for a neighboring grandfather to drive a small bread truck to take her northeast to see the snow.
The old man sat in a bread truck from the south to the northeast watching the snow?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was gone.
How did his wife get a business license to open a hotel on a scrapped ship?
On the island flying car party small mixed why can gently loosen the mountain road to seal the road?
Then in the middle of the road the truck that sent the reinforcement stopped at the side of the road, and the truck driver could not find it all the way around.
The sense of the tool is too obvious.
Why would a little gangster party with no credentials and a suspicion of illegality become a paramilitary?
Why don't you call the police in the face of high interest loans, the police in the movie also asked specially whether there are difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a hotel's door with a room card and then forcefully arranges not to find a hotel boss to sit outside the door and sleep?
This mysterious plot fills the whole movie, because the plot is so out of touch that it pains me when I remember it.
Besides the plot, what's even worse is the film's plot, or rather the film has no plot at all, it's a disgusting twist.
At the beginning of the movie you think he wants to make a comedy, and more than 20 minutes later you guess it might be an encouraging film, and halfway through it you think it might be a story about a small town young man struggling to survive, and when you finish it you don't really know what you've been watching, and then there's a deep suspicion of yourself, why you've gone to the theater to enjoy your big time.
For most people, you're actually very familiar with all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, you've got motivation + comedy and then you tell the audience how a talented bird of a feather moves one step to success.
If you want to make a love movie, you have to be honest about the wrangling between a young man in a small town who likes to ride motorcycles and his sister-in-law.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot cannot be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin is playing has just been burned, and the character can still sing), can't open some brain holes that can't even be seen by Kennedy.
As for the lady apparently not weak in some respects can perform like a five-year-old child, I really don't know the reason for acting or the director's requirement.
There's something else I don't really understand. Why is Han Kang, as a racer, so passionate about adding crash scenes to his own movie?
Isn't this kind of film arranged for the Spring Festival, to add to the crowd?

Inspection of well concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment introduction:
Zhengzhou Yi Xin is a domestic concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment, inspection well block machinery, well wall wall module machinery professional manufacturer, from semi-automatic to fully automatic production line.
Through years of practice and development, we now have high quality, mainly produce hydraulic, mobile, fully automatic inspection well series equipment and accessories.
Inspection of well concrete module production processing equipment Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment assembly site:
The characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou well wall brick module equipment for inspecting the production and processing of well concrete modules:
The equipment of the well block brick machine is widely applied to new construction materials such as coal, heat, water, electricity and gas for municipal underground structures.
Examples: all kinds of inspection wells, rainwater outlets, ditches, wastewater treatment ponds and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc. for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of constructing inspection wells with concrete modules is that the modules are convex and convex all around, and the combined construction forms a chain lock.
The shear resistance of well walls is much better than that of flat friction blocks.
The module is a mid-air structure, combined with the construction of longitudinal pore through the pore, horizontal pore through the pore, the pore core is poured, forming the concrete grid structure, and serves the secondary reinforcement and waterproofing function.
The modules are equipped with intersection grooves both horizontally and vertically, and the horizontal and vertical intersection increases the overall strength of the structure accordingly.
In addition, the inspection and drainage wells constructed using concrete inspection well modules are not likely to collapse, sink, leakage, etc., and the mechanical performance of the wall wall modules is stable, operation is simple, and the molding size is standard.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment intelligent control equipped with data input and output device one-button touch LCD display monitor the whole process of mechanical operation, realize the ideal human machine dialogue, automatic analysis ratio, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The mechanical hydraulic system of the wall modules of wells uses single cylinder hydraulic and conveyor, double cylinder hydraulic and conveyor.
Independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the influence of the main engine vibration on the hydraulic system, thus ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
Concrete inspection well module brick machine equipment cloth box walk in mould box moulding up, storage box door closed, automatic transfer of board, all done by hydraulic system independently, thus achieving the reduction of machine wear and maintenance.

South African Doctor: Omicron has a strong transmitter, but it's mostly mild
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus, the Omikjon strain, is lighter than the Delta strain, although it spreads faster.
In South Africa, more than 5,000 doctors and medical organizations in the South African province of Hoden reported that they are treating new coronary patients with mild symptoms, such as pain and cough, similar to flu, as the disease spreads, according to U.S. news agency Reuters.
The organisation's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but there were no patients needed to be hospitalized.
“They are able to control disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of being isolated,” said Pierre.
He says this includes the elderly and those with health problems, who would have been more likely to become seriously infected with the coronary virus.
Compared to that, he said, in the previous wave of Delta outbreaks, he treated new coronary patients with "difficulties in breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days.”
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron strain in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30 per cent of new-borns hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half the rate of the previous wave of epidemics; the average hospitalization time was reduced from eight to 2.8 days; only 3 per cent of recent new-borns died, and 20 per cent of early-onset cases in South Africa.
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: “At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease.”
“It’s early now,” he said, “and we need to get the later data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur late, and we only enter the epidemic in two weeks.”
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Derta is still the world's leading new crown virus strain, cases of Omikyon disease are occurring in dozens of countries, South Africa being the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Hoden Province increased by 400 per cent, and tests showed that more than 90 per cent of the cases of the Omikjon mutation occurred.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes are all out!

Education Review: What is it to save abducted children?
If it were to be compared to the famous public-interest advertisement that "no sale kills" , then, in a good environment without the need for "kidnapping", group-control, mass-anti-kidnapping, making the acts of kidnapping and selling unprofitable, high-risk, and costly, such crimes would not happen again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has launched an emergency platform for publishing information on the abduction and development of missing children.
It is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for publishing missing children's information and timely retrieval of abducted children.
Listening to the app called "团圆," I felt warm.
New technology means not only the name "literature," full of emotions, but also the use of information correctly, practical and effective.
The first objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to find the kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, ranging from individual punishment, social prevention, to legal education, can be summed up in many “big words.”
But before a trafficking case is brought to trial, priority should be given to the safety of the victims.
The matter can be delayed and discussed with caution, for the purposes of urgent "rescue," such as whether or not the sale of children should be subject to the death penalty, subjects of widespread controversy and controversy; but the matter of rescuing abducted children should not be considered.
Based on the detection experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to staying away from the scene as soon as possible after receiving the money.
The more the kidnapping delays a minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the more difficult the case will be to detect.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic move to put in place a platform such as “unity” that will directly help to detect cases and find effective ways to retrieve children.
After all, “kidnapping” is a huge task that requires the entire legal system to function properly.
The fight against crime, the protection of the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfecting of legislation, to the guarantee of justice, and the rigorous enforcement, does not need to follow the care of "care of the weak child".
Moreover, prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can also be done better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three takes a break at a train station, and the parents fall asleep and wake up to find the child gone.
You can't expect a two-year-old to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or put the child under proper protection, is the minimum means of preventing children from being kidnapped.
On the other hand, from the police's point of view of combating the crime of kidnapping, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just a ring in a long chain.
According to our country's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of kidnapping and selling children is five years' imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can lead to the death penalty and confiscation of property.
The highest and highest levels of punishment and, in the light of the trend towards "less punishment", child trafficking is clearly a more punitive offence.
But there are still many cases of kidnapping every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in the concept of raising children and legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the population should be pursued in parallel.
In order to effectively control the crime of kidnapping, it is not possible to rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the abduction "market" exists widely, the abductions are driven by the interests of the abductors, constantly innovating abduction methods, forming a "fighting law" situation with the law enforcement, the abduction operations will fall into a low-efficiency muddle.
Therefore, removing backward ideas and spreading the common sense of law will also help to eradicate the crime of child abduction and abduction.
The spirit of the 19th 6th Central Assembly and Provincial Party Assembly of China
Draw Strength from the Party's Hundred Years' Struggle
On the morning of December 10, in accordance with the unified arrangements of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Hunan, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Hunan and the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of Hunan, Mr. Yang Kodong, made an interactive speech at the Video Cultural Garden in Mabar Mountain, to learn in depth how to implement the spirit of the Party's sixteenth session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Hunan, to learn how to implement the spirit of the important instructions given to the keynote speakers of the Communist Party of Hunan, and to learn how to implement the spirit of the province's twelfth session of the Party.
From the three aspects of ideal conviction and primary mission, self-revolution and youth big party, the Party leader and the theory of the Party, Yang Hodong combined his own perception and personal experience to explain the core principles and practical requirements of the spirit of the General Assembly in an in-depth and comprehensive manner.
He pointed out that the spirit of the General Assembly should be combined with the spirit of guiding and endorsing the important statements made by the President of Hunan and the spirit of the Provincial Party Assembly, and that it should be integrated with each other to strengthen the defence of the "two establishments," to achieve the "two safeguards," the political consciousness and the consciousness of action, and to move forward firmly in the direction guided by the President of Hunan.
In the interactive dialogue, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of the two establishments, how to grasp the direction of cultural enterprises, how to draw strength from the history of the Party's hundreds of years, etc., and Yang responded with common language and vivid examples.

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two main categories: virgin olive oil and refined olive oil.
The first-pressed olive oil, or natural olive oil, is the grease obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by means of mechanical cold-pressing, filtering and other processes to remove the foreign matter.
Depending on the different acidity can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: is the highest quality and highest quality olive oil, and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a mild and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly high in acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin olive oil: tastes and flavours acceptable, but not more than 3.3% acidity.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after first-pressed olive oil refining with an acidity exceeding 3.3% or becoming "second-pressed oil".
Olive oil refining can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of the first-pressed olive oil to harmonize flavor and colour, with a acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale gold yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is an olive oil extracted and refined from an oil residue by means of a solution.
The acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator, as you should have noticed by looking at the ratings.
You know, olives are like wine grapes, and olives from different regions and varieties of olives produce different standards of olive oil.
The best place to grow oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for olive oil growth, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity and precipitation.
Other areas, except along the Mediterranean coast, can only be planted in habitats with zero stars.
Major producing regions (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on.
Months of oil olive harvest:
From July to October, the fruit begins to grow and mature, passing from green to red, purple, and finally black.
November to February is the harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, such as fatty acids and fatty acids, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil ever found.
At the end of the democratic summit, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Barack Obama and attended by governments and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, wrapped up on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, he said that the fire of freedom burned in the hearts of everyone in the world, and that authoritarian regimes could never extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global “democracy summit” next year.
The representative of the Taiwanese government, the administrative commissioner, Mr Tang Feng, and Hong Kong's current exiled democratic human rights activist, Mr Roe Chung-chung, also spoke at the summit the following day.
“We know how hard the work is before us,” said Biden.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because as I said before, as this summit has shown, the democratic world is everywhere.
Dictatorships can never extinguish the tiny flame of freedom that burns in the hearts of people all over the world.”
He also said that defence of democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
“As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the fence of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent accountable governance, to resist the power of deterrence and shock from dictatorships, and to those who seek power nakedly before the public interest,” he said.
The next day’s “Democracy Summit” will focus on defending human rights, consolidating democracy and opposing power, as well as fighting digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said democracy faces global challenges, especially those posed by emerging digital technologies.
“Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience,” he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong's human rights activist, Mr Roe Chung-chung, delivered a pre-recorded video speech at the summit, reminding participants of the continuing concern over the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as the Uyghurs and Tibetans in Hong Kong.
For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable, he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our first priority.”
He also called on the free world to unite against the threats of the Communist Party of China.
“Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy the Chinese government, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you don’t realize the threat to our democratic values,” he said.
And that's why we failed.
That is why we must change.”
In a roundtable discussion on “fighting digital dictatorship and affirming democratic values,” Taiwan’s Executive Board member, Mr Tang Feng, released a State Declaration via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the new cholera epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"As Taiwan's democracy flourishes, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of decline.
But in Taiwan, we don’t have to shut down to control the epidemic; we don’t have to go down to fight fake information.”
At the same time as the Democratic Summit was scheduled for the next day, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who have been found to be seriously violating human rights, and restrictions on investments by a Chinese company that has been found to be using surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the mouthwater chicken from the restaurant is fresh
Want to try tennis, but also afraid that you won't stick to it, so try to find a near-priced trainer first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then the normal situation is more expensive than the cheaper one, which is actually industrial garbage.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits on the pad, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't overcome, the masters are hard to control.
The logic and the underlying words of their existence are-- tennis is so hard, knowing that you won't learn, knowing that you won't be willing to buy expensive things to fool you with, knowing that you played twice, that you won't play again, and that it's cheaper, and that you won't have any pain.
If you can really tell the difference between good and bad, and show that you've made progress, then come back and buy something from me, and I'll make twice as much money.
We recommend to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand better replica, choose Prince or Dunlop, both brands are not famous enough, so good replicas are not worth the price, new ones are good 500, 600, second-hand ones are 200, have a thousand yuan replica doesn't taste good?
It's very friendly to newcomers, but once you've gone through the newcomer phase, it's like a chicken rib, but most people, especially girls, can't go through the newcomer phase.
Order has been delayed several times
Could you please help me to follow up?

In fact, there is a lot of talk about wearing dresses for little fat girls.
Fat girls don't wear dresses that are either too short or too long. The length is close to the knee and can cover the fat part of their thighs.
The short skirt will expose the fat on the legs.
Too long will make you feel short and fat.
If you take out the top and the bottom three sections, it looks like you're getting naturally taller, with different colors on your upper body, dress and stockings, and it looks like you're getting a sense of extension.
In fact, many deep colored dresses are the markings of little fat girls (the author knows this well), deep color is also a good way to cover your body fat, elegant black short skirts are also the favorites of little fat girls.
Put on deep colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you feel thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular it becomes, the better, and the color doesn't get too bright.
Avoid getting the feeling of obesity when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For a little fat girl, it's important to tell her how to dress well.
Little fat girls don't wear tight short skirts, and don't wear short skirts or tight skirts, which can make them look uncomfortable. If your legs are rough, you should wear black stockings or grid stockings (the kind of grid ones, oh), choose a soft printed horn skirt, and put on a sleeveless coat, which can well cover the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, the little fat girls are also elegant in short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts and should choose a coat that matches the color of the short skirt, so that your fat body will have a higher effect.
Short skirts with high heels, can make your legs look longer, this is the summer's best in combination Oh!
If you are a fat but thin-leggedMM, we recommend you to choose a gorgeous tie shorts.
Not only does it cover your belly, but it also shows your strengths.
A short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, the coat should choose tighter, forming a layer feeling will be more thin.
Simple single white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls are also fashionable.
As long as you know how to dress well, little fat girls will be the focus of attention.
After a change in the way you dress, do more exercise in your life, and try to get rid of the label of little fat girls early in the day.[4]

The girl is the arrow target for the sister to donate: " Thought is skin injury is better " - wikipedia.org
A girl stands in front of a large wooden board in Hangzhou's Wuling Square with the words "human meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl donating 'arrow targets' to her sister" broke the circle of friends.
The photograph shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a human, with the words "human meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on the board, indicating that pedestrians can shoot with arrows after paying.
The act sparked enthusiasm among the Netizens.
Last night, the head of the Hangzhou Public Prosecution Office's downtown office confirmed to reporters in the New York Times that police confirmed that the girl had made such an outrageous move to raise money for her sister, but that it was not worth advocating. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
The Girl's Street "Arrow Target" Donation Admonition
A long-haired girl stands in front of a large wooden board in black ink with the words "human target, 10 yuan one arrow" on it, and another wooden board in front of her has her bank account, Weibo account, pay-per-view account, etc.
The picture caused controversy on the Internet.
A number of netizens believed that this act was a "begging behavior of the ball of the eye," and also many netizens expressed sympathy for this.
“We found out about 10 a.m. on the 23rd when we were patrolling by the square, and there were already a lot of people around.”
In an interview with local media, the police at the Tian Shui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stand, all about 20 years old, dressed in their youthful beauty.
Among them, the girl who was a "human target" was crying and asking the passer-by to play the game; the other girl was on the side shouting, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia, and she needed surgery now, so please help her.
“We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was donating to treat her sister’s leukemia.”
Last night, the head of publicity at the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told reporters in the New York Times that the girl, named Ji Jia Li, donated to her sister Jia Yang.
But as treatments still cost more than 300,000 dollars, it was not possible to find a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target, one responsible for hand-to-hand, but did not participate in it, the whole process did not find anyone shooting, just someone watching and taking photos on the microblogging.
After the police have been identified by the security department, the use of archery is not subject to control.
The head of the department said that "it is not advisable to take such an eyeball donation approach."
After being warned by police officers, she left the police station.

What will be the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt about the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
There's an article in the previous paragraph that says project managers can hit gold medals in many projects: moving bricks, going on business, staying up at night are the daily tasks of project managers, rescuing fires, backing boilers, apologizing, and so on.
An article that seems to be a joke, but also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, behind represents the current project management's powerlessness.
And the people involved in project management, also gradually choose to take some actions to get rid of the work difficulties.
According to the annually rising number of PMP (Internationally Certified Project Management Professional Qualification) registrations, more and more project managers are raising their project management skills through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMP® enrolled in the country is nearly 60,000, the number of PMP® certified is about 420,000, and the number of valid certificates is about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total global number of PMP® certificates.
Over the past decade, the number of PMP holders has grown year by year, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that it is impossible to do things simply by relying on past "old experience," and that changing work environments let us know the way forward for a learner who stands on the shoulders of a science giant.
However, can the examination of PMP ensure the smooth running of project management without obstruction?
Many beginners in project management say that by studying relevant courses such as PMP/IPMP, you can systematically master the ten areas of project management and the five process groups, etc., but it's a bit of a mess when you're really doing project management.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: lack of awareness of project management, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, uncertain how to practice; lack of system support for project management process system, unable to land in the workplace, uncertain project estimation, poor control sensitivity, project dragging on and on; unclear division of labour among members, uncertain how to deal with "old oil bars" in the team Intersectoral assistance in communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to advance ...
Thus, focusing on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of R&D key talents such as product managers, project managers, and has received the honorary title of "China's R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" China Tian Hua Xian Consulting with the "R&D Project Managers Special Training Camp" online course.
R&D Project Managers Training Course This is a decoupled online learning method that combines real-world cases, tools and methods of many R&D-type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to use lower cost and less input, promote the process of project manager training, and bring efficient operational results for enterprises.
This course is not only conducted by the China Tianhua Summer Expert Team (formerly Huawei R&D Management Team), combined with international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, to give in-depth and in-depth professional explanation of the course content.
Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich templates, and help students to translate the contents of their studies into concrete work after class.

"Two-Two-Two" on the eve of Consumer Advocacy for Reasonable Consumption - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
This year, the total amount of transactions in the national network payments business during the "Twin Eleven" festival reached $1.77 trillion, which is higher than in previous years.
Once again, consumers have benefited from the abundance of full red packets and live-streams that capture the eye of the beholder. On the one hand, the consumption boom has stunned the nation's increasingly strong consumer power, and on the other hand, it has had to calm down to think about the impact of consumerism on society and the contemporary mainstream consumer groups.
On the eve of the "Double Twelve", JFE Consumer Financial Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as JFE) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding consumers, especially young people, to develop a good consumer consciousness and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Analysis Report released by the People's Bank this year, the National Consumer Financial Literacy Index was 66.81, up 2.04 from 2019.
Overall, China's residents perform better on the level of financial consumption, but the different aspects of financial behavior and skills show greater differences, it is necessary to further improve the basic financial knowledge level.
The relatively low level of financial literacy among the elderly and young people will continue to be a focus of attention in financial education; the Nielsen Report on China's Youth Debt and China's Youth Consumption Report 2019-2020, published by CCTV Financial Services, show that the younger generation has enormous consumer potential and credit consumption is an important way to upgrade consumption; 86.6% of young people use credit products and nearly half do not accumulate debts; the younger generation, while overall showing a rational consumption trend, differs greatly from the "excessive waste" labels on the outside world, but some young people do have excessive consumption and consumption behavior that creates excessive financial pressure and debt risk, and even leads to increasing social problems.
As a licensed consumer financial institution,捷信 has been committed to helping people build their own happy lives by providing quality and careful services, advocating consumers to establish a good and correct consumer outlook, and actively responding to regulatory calls, in order to raise consumers' rational consumption consciousness, especially younger groups.
Over the past several years, the company has been conducting all-round, diversified financial knowledge dissemination activities aimed at youth groups including university students, and through the cooperation with top universities in the country launching innovative practice competitions and other forms of submerging the consumption demands of youth groups, helping them to establish rational consumption concepts, rationally plan consumption demands, and thus help their accumulated life wealth.
On the eve of the twentieth anniversary, the letter reminds all consumer friends to establish a reasonable consumption consciousness and a correct view of money, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, and to avoid consumer borrowing errors, so as not to affect personal confidence and future economic life.
Plan ahead of time when consuming and pay back on time.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have a negative impact on future economic life such as buying a car and buying a home.
At the same time, while enjoying financial products and services, it should also choose the formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to verifying whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
With its mature, reliable consumer financial system and constantly updated iterative financial products, JFE will continue to provide consumers with more tailor-made and diversified services, continuously assisting the public in raising the level of financial knowledge, helping consumers cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and becoming consumers' lifelong reliable consumer financial partners.

Vietnam People's Newspapers - Gulf Cooperation Commission to Face Joint Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Amman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and of having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have severely affected the internal unity of the Commonwealth and have had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward “unity and stability” mediated by the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in restoring relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to Qatar through the two countries.
The Arab States of the Gulf seek to resolve their differences and respond to common challenges by restoring relations with Qatar based on the need to unite in the interests of countries and regional stability.
During the visit, both sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for both citizens to travel and integrate the supply chain.
Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in Amman, and the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $300 billion.
His visit to the Gulf countries coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world’s major powers on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear deal – an agreement condemned by a Gulf Arab country for failing to resolve the Iranian missile problem.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States considered that there was a flaw in failing to resolve the Iranian missile problem and to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has negotiated directly with Iran against the background that the nuclear negotiations with the major powers have failed to satisfy the aspirations of the Gulf States.
Its aim is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Commission countries.
The forthcoming summit of the Commonwealth will be the first summit of the Commonwealth countries since the end of disputes between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity to re-evaluate the diplomatic achievements of the Gulf Cooperation Commission to contribute to the restoration of the unity of the Commonwealth and to propose measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in responding to common challenges and to contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Call the new mountainous area ultra-run exhaust the loudest!
This time our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It was the flagship of Lamborghini, and the replacement model of Murcielago – the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of the horse is nearly two million dollars, the road tax is ten thousand dollars a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast?
The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, and it's probably the same as myvi that gets to 30km/h when people get to 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, the rugged shear doors, the huge gas vents that surround the car, and the glass next to an endless list of 6.5 v12 engines perfectly illustrate Lamborghini's style.
For the description of the car doesn't need to say too much, if you Google yourself, just organize some of the explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too much attention, to go where everybody is looking, very uncomfortable (actually a bit refreshing)
1km oil money is around RM1 (the driver doesn't care at all)
You have to practice getting up and down, or you'll get a little embarrassed (because you can't climb the cabin and hold half of it)
The engine is too loud and you'll be deaf when you get out of the car.(But it's still cool)
The car is too big to be parked in a normal parking lot and is very afraid of being knocked at the door when the next car opens!
A little lonely because there are no opponents on the road (the official said, it's not about the driver, ha ha)
Don't get me wrong, this video is not for sale. Sorry!

Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate with frequency - wikipedia.org
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of schooling philosophy and value pursuits which accumulated long-term in the course of development of a university, is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to now, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first university in the modern sense, the university has a unique mission unlike other social organizations. For our university, it was born in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of times, advocating the values of "Ming De Jiang, Shu Zhi Jiping" and the patriotism of "Building a strong country".
Currently, higher education informationization and internationalization trends are becoming increasingly obvious, global educational competition, technological competition, talent competition is increasingly exacerbated, higher education as an important "supply side," its structural reform is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the proposal of the overall programme for the promotion of world-class universities and the construction of world-class disciplines shows our country's confidence and determination to move from higher-education to higher-education to higher-education to higher-education, and also puts forward higher-renewable requirements for the development of universities.
How can we accelerate the construction of a number of world - class universities and a number of world - class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap and achieve the " curve supercar " in a shorter time?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should take full advantage of three advantages: First, the after-effect advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas, learning from the advanced experience of world-leading universities, and achieving a significant improvement in the academic level and the quality of schooling; Second, the cultural advantage, inheriting the wisdom connotation of the Chinese civilization accumulated in five millennia, promoting the development of the excellent traditional culture, thereby consolidating strength, shaping brands, and raising image; Third, the institutional advantage, exploiting the institutional superiority of the socialist country, strengthening the objective drive, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a solid guarantee that schools will accelerate to surpass the advanced level of the
It is especially important to realize that it is not possible to build a world-class university on the one hand and that each school must show its individuality and characteristics while playing an advantage.
The characteristics of running schools must have the common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect their own unique goals, schooling traditions and resources talents.
With regard to Zhejiang University, we have focused on three aspects of our schooling: firstly, highlighting the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurial talent training, building an integrated environment for the integration of faculty and enterprises, and fostering an ecosystem of entrepreneurial education; secondly, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary clustering, promoting the optimum adjustment of the discipline system, creating a cross-disciplinary institutional environment, actively nurturing cross-emerging disciplines and symbolic cross-products; and, thirdly, highlighting the characteristics of our schooling system and social services, conducting deep international exchange and cooperation, and accelerating the formation of the cooperation system of the Pan-Zhejiang University of Agricultural Science and Technology.
In this process, it is especially important to always maintain the university spirit and let the university spirit and the spirit of the times resonate with frequency.
For Zhejiang University, the newest system of expression of Zhejiang University’s spirit is founded on the teaching of “keep seeking innovation,” common values of “practice, morality, discernment, and faithfulness,” as well as “the Hana River, the enlightenment of truth, the pre-existing people, and the state of trees and trees.”
This is an important guarantee that the school maintains the correct direction of running the school, constantly accumulate the cultural high and cohesive spiritual strength, connotation rich and meaningful.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodied in the heart of "the world's wisdom for me," embodied in the quality philosophy of drawing up the world's leading schools to educate people; "Enlightenment and Goodness" emphasizes the spirit of truth-to-goodness, which means that universities, while pursuing the truth, should take more of the brimstone of the cultivation and personality of virtue; "Experienced People" emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes both the search for new knowledge, the innovation of scientific research, as well as the development of reform and transformation; "Tree My Country" emphasizes the spirit of patriotic devotion, saying that universities should always be honored with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual ideas and pursuit of values is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120 years of running.
“He who is wise hears in silence, and he who is wise sees in intangible.”
When China's higher education institutions further build on the overall cause of Chinese characteristics and socialism, deeply grasp the historical orientation and responsibilities of the higher education cause, and accelerate the construction to become a world-class university.
At the same time, by maintaining human care and independent freedom, the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit are mutually turbulent, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of national prosperity and national revival and the realization of the common ideals of mankind.

As the NFT exploded, the encryption community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with residents losing their jobs due to the epidemic beginning to earn stable incomes from the game.
"Axie Infinity" is a bottom-up pet-generated game based on blockchain technology, featuring multiple gameplays including NFT, and is the highest-denominated NFT project to date, with more than $30 billion.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earned more than $820 million a day, making it a hit for King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded one million.
The thrill of Axie Infinity has transferred a new "palytoearn" mode to more people, with blockchains and smart contracts helping players become no longer a single player, but can also participate in the game's eco-government, in addition to enjoying and gaining economic benefits from the game.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game's creators, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Looking at the news about the share price of friends, my biggest touch is the choice of the enterprises in the race, i.e. the choice of the industry that indicates the investment mark, first of all to choose the industry that has a large growth space, at least the market size of more than 10 billion; secondly, to choose the industry that will be good growth in the future, consider the industry that will reach the best state of growth in the next 3-5 years; and finally, to choose the industry that has policy support.
How wide is the market, how long is the stage of development of the industry, how flat or rough is the competition pattern of the industry.
For the right racecourse!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment 2022 tactical layout.
The strategy is to do the things right.
The strategy is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and above most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought of either continuously deepening the current field or extending the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be thought of how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase activity participation (tactical thinking) can be thought of how to set the right activity KPIs, achieve the right activity goals, such as increasing targeted customer participation, activating high-value silent customers, accurate downloads; for example, how to increase DAU (tactical thinking) can be thought of whether current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Bitcoin, which was born 12 years ago, will be celebrating several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal currency, the first time Bitcoin became a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved ProShares' introduction of the Bitcoin futures ETF on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time in eight years, marking the first regulated Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market and a further expansion of cryptocurrency investment.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main player.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American group complains of discrimination in admission to Yale and other three regular spring Fuji name schools - wikipedia.org
More than 130 ethnic groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting the discrimination against students applying for admissions at three popular universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian Education League, which has raised the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yuquan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the criteria for admission to American universities has doubled over the past decade, but the proportion of Asian-Americans at these three American universities remains essentially at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities, in the process of admission under the so-called “composite considerations,” have “long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants.”
Research by scholars such as Sands in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest enrollment rate among all ethnic groups in the three universities, according to Zhao U-kai.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all the colleges of the Commonwealth, Brown and Dartmouth College have the lowest enrollment rates for Asian students, and Yale and Brown have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao told Xinhua news agency that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate the complaint and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians when enrolling.
They also expect the complained universities to take the issue seriously and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three colleges complained of have not yet responded.
The Association for Asian Education was founded in 2015, when it complained of discrimination against admissions to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups involved in the complaint, there were also Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American educational groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned of a factory building in Zhejiang Yu Yao Jiao Ting Town from a housing agency, and after seeing the building several times, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu, after consulting with the family of the owner, Mr. Lin, about the details of the purchase of the factory building, made a deposit of 20,000 yuan by bank transfer.
"If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell the factory, the deposit will be doubled back to the seller, and the two parties agree to sign a contract for the sale of the factory within one week.
However, the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the sale of the factory and the method of payment, were not agreed by the parties, which resulted in the delay in signing the contract.
Considering the failure of the two sides to reach a consensus on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned Mr. Lu's $20,000 deposit.
It was not easy to see the house, the money was paid, the rent was ready, and the contract was signed "on the doorstep", but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu unable and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu brought a case against Mr. Lin to the People's Court of Yu Yao City.
The court considered that the parties had failed to conclude a formal contract and could not be held solely responsible for the defendant, which should reasonably be deemed to be unsuccessful in consultation. Therefore, the fine should not apply in this case, and the defendant did not have to bear double the default liability for the reimbursement of the deposit.
After the trial, the plaintiff brought an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second Instance maintained the original ruling.
[Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [Counsel reminds] [
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer must fulfil the necessary duties of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and clarifying in the contract the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent conflicts between the parties in the execution of the contract.
At the end of Friday's "Democracy Summit," China's foreign ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the "Democracy Summit of Leaders" was organized by the U.S. "in ideological terms, by making democracy tools, weapons, and counter-democratic practices in the name of false democracy, inciting divisional confrontation and shifting internal contradictions."
The Chinese government believes, “For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, implemented ‘democratic reforms,’ abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a ‘color revolution,’ with disastrous consequences.
“Democracy” has long been the weapon of mass destruction in which the US intervenes in other countries.
The summit was a step in the right direction for Biden to honour his campaign commitments.
The two-day video conference was attended by leaders from 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the issue of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are voices of doubt both internationally and within the United States, such as criticism of the leaders invited to the summit, including some authoritarian-minded leaders, such as those from the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who doubt that the government's real intention was to organize the summit for geopolitical purposes rather than for democracy.
The newly-appointed German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also attended the video-democracy summit
China’s foreign ministry said on Saturday, “Today’s American democracy manifests itself as a disease of money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic conflicts, and the fragmentation of the rich and poor,” and that American democracy is a rich-man game based on capital.
“As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to strengthen the fence of democracy, to push for reforms, to achieve transparent accountability, to resist the power of deterrence and shock from dictatorships, and to those who seek power nakedly before the public interest,” US President Barack Obama said in a statement.
He emphasized that democracy is not taken for granted, and that “we must keep updating it in every generation, which in my view is the decisive challenge of our time.”
He also said that global democracy and human rights “require fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges.”
The United States pledged to launch a one-year operation after the summit, including an initiative worth $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and to provide support to independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let us all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," he said.

Educational Thinking: How University Examinations Make "Heavens" and "Study Scrappers" Each Get Their Place - wikipedia.org
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote a letter to the head of the school, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination type, so that the examination really reflects the student's actual level of appeal.
Indeed, university examinations have long been a “hot topic.”
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with different levels of competence, plus different levels of learning, and different conditions of learning.
When evaluating a group with such diverse characteristics, there are different feelings, which are inevitable.
Of course, if the exam questions are single and repeat rate high, the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don't do well may be able to do well by concentrating before exams, and if you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve a half-work-to-work effect.
In this way, there is a "school scrap" that can be passed or even scored high if it is not used normally; a "school boss" never drops out of class, does good homework, notes, and does not score much higher on exams than a "strange status quo."
It seems that the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in university examinations is not without reason, believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou University.
From this point of view, compliments are to be given to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, all those who have graduated from universities are aware of the phenomenon of trying to prepare for exams, trying to obtain "focused counseling" before exams, trying to draw up examination scopes, and trying to "scoop up" exam questions from teachers.
In the author's view, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring whether a university examination is passed or not, more lies in teachers' comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning, and on the basis of scientific propositions.
In the undergraduate stage, majors begin to be subdivided, and many major courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge of a discipline is the subject of university examination.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory of the discipline and basic common sense, from the point of view of knowledge, the space of change is not large, it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, “The basics of university mathematics 20 years ago are still being studied, or are being studied.”
But the knowledge point is basically unchanged, does not represent the test question type single, test question repetition.
In many universities, examinations are usually composed of a group of subjects, and the examination papers are co-ordinated by senior faculty members. The examination papers are also attended by the entire faculty member, so that the repetition of the subjects can be overcome to some extent.
However, in order to develop a set of test questions that are in line with teaching and learning practice, the subjects are difficult to distribute in equilibrium according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to master the teaching situation in a comprehensive way, to analyze the degree of students' learning in a comprehensive way, so that the test propositions are dynamically grasped by the difficulty and type of subjects, and can highlight the examination of basic knowledge, as well as taking into account the examination of abilities, while designing innovatively the type of subjects.
Examination is the commanding rod of university education, what kind of examination students will have corresponding preparatory programmes, will affect the effectiveness of university education in the past.
For the students' letter of recommendation, Lanzhou gave high priority to the university side, has deployed the correction program in the entire school.
Requests teaching units to organize teachers to conduct peer review and peer review of course completion examinations, to formulate test questions and related systems, to strengthen supervision and inspection of test questions and examination processes, to refine performance assessment, and to strengthen comprehensive assessment of course teaching processes.
The problem of solving the problems of single type of questions and repetition of questions from the mechanism is the subject of university examination needs to face, of course need to introduce the corresponding system, but Kung Fu is expensive in everyday life, the teacher needs to have full knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to take over teaching content, but also to take over students' learning situation, both to take over, teaching and learning will be better coupled, form a good interaction, examination will be more practical, so that the "learner" and "learner's residue" each get to their advantage.
If I can't change the location of the branch, can I change it for outsourcing?

The photographer is also humorous and enjoys taking pictures all day long.
When we choose a photo, because we see a lot of cases online, we don't want to let guests delete too many photos, but when we choose a photo, really, it doesn't mean at all that we add photos, 24 of the menu directly, not one added (I heard about my cousin who took the wedding picture with me almost in time, more than 7,000 of the menu also added more than 10,000 photos, I was astonished, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many
Today the photo was repaired, ran hair for me, I looked at two didn't feel good, they immediately helped me rework it.

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without survivor paper specially made to prevent paper breakage
(AIP) The Sabah National Registry said that it had not been possible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since the beginning of October, due to the use of light from specially designed paper-protected stores. The number of affected people has grown to 3,200.
However, the bureau's director, Mr. Keru Aminus, assured that all infants who had applied for survivor's paper had been recorded in the system and would be reimbursed when the counterfeit paper was shipped next week.
At a news conference, he explained the 10-month-long reporting of a web-based media outlet pointing to the problem of paper printing in Sabah newspapers.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago and that the same problem was facing the country.
“One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting papers have been affected by the epidemic, which has resulted in delays in deliveries to our country.”
He explained that the use of counterfeit paper in Saba newspapers was different from that in other regions and that it was not possible to borrow inventories from other states.
The latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper was delivered to Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and handed over to the printing company for some printing on 8th, Keru Aminus said.
“The Bureau will dispatch people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for the final phase of printing, which is expected to be delivered to the applicants within two working days (December 20).”
"We'll notify applicants to go to the branch offices to get their papers."
He added that Saba had issued a total of 24,081 newspapers so far this year.
I've been waiting for more than seven
Isn't that coming soon?
I mean food
I'm back in front of PRS
Well, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready
People's Daily commentator: "145" achieves a good start-up - on learning to implement the spirit of the Central Economic Working Conference - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency Beijing, December 11, Daily People's Daily, December 12, Commentator's article: "The Fourteenth Five" achieves a good start - on learning to follow the spirit of the Central Economic Working Conference
The Central Economic Working Conference, held from 8 to 10 December, highly evaluated the achievements of China's economic and social development over the past year.
At the meeting, the Chinese President gave a keynote speech, summarized the economic work for 2021 in depth, analyzed the current economic situation in depth, and made a major deployment of the economic work for 2022.
We solemnly celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, officially announce the establishment of China's Central Asian Republic, achieve the first hundred years of struggle objectives, launch a comprehensive socialist modernization state, and embark on a new journey towards the second hundred years of struggle objectives.
We convened the sixteenth session of the Central Committee of the Party to summarize the great achievements and historical experiences of the Party's hundred years of struggle, and adopted the third historic resolution in the history of the Party's hundred years, "Resolution on the great achievements and historical experiences of the Party's hundred years of struggle," which is the political declaration of the Communist Party of China in the new era, bearing in mind its primary mission, adherence to and development of the Chinese characteristics, and is a guideline for action to identify history, create the future and realize the great revival of the Chinese nation.
Over the past year, the world's 100 years of unprecedented change and the pandemic of pneumonia have been intertwined with the global epidemic, the external environment has become more complex and severe, and the domestic tasks of the prevention and control of pneumonia and economic and social development have become more and more difficult.
The Central Committee, which is headed by Comrade Xi Jinping, insists on co-ordinating the two major issues at home and internationally, insists on a steady search for the overall basis for its work, is committed to dealing with the changes of the century and the epidemic of the century, co-ordinating epidemic control and economic and social development, accelerating the construction of new development patterns, strengthening the cross-cyclical adjustment of macroeconomic policies, striving to promote the sustained healthy development of the economy, striving to deepen reform and opening-up innovation, and striving to accomplish the difficult tasks of reform and development.
A key aspect of the good start of the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan is to build new development patterns, take new steps and achieve new results.
China's economic development and epidemic control have maintained a global leading position, and the characteristics of developing a strong resilience, great potential and strong momentum continue to emerge; the country's strategic and technological strength has accelerated rapidly, and significant innovation results have emerged in competition; the ability of science and technology has been continuously enhanced, and key core technological challenges have achieved new breakthroughs; the resilience of the chain of industry has been enhanced, the volume of foreign trade has increased, and the structure has continued to optimize, and the new dynamics represented by new industries and new modes of business have grown; reform and opening-up has been advanced deeply, and efforts have been made to bridge the bottlenecks that restrict the matching of supply and the flow of elements, in order to create new advantages in cooperation and competition at a high level;
The achievement of these achievements is the result of the strong leadership of the Central Committee under the leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping, the result of the scientific guidelines of the People's Party of China and the result of the hard work and hard struggle of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country.
Practice once again proves that the Party has established the central position of Xi Jinping's comrades in the Central Committee and the entire Party, and the guiding position of Xi Jinping and Zhaoping in the new era, which has decisive significance for the development of the party's undertakings in the new era and for the promotion of the historic process of the great revival of the Chinese nation.
With the Chinese People's Party as the core of the Central Committee and the core of the entire Party, with the scientific guidelines of the Chinese People's Party, with the unity of mind and tenacious struggle of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, we will surely be able to overcome all kinds of difficult obstacles and create a new era of glory and new historic achievements on the new course of the socialist modernization of the country.
Next year, the party will hold its twenty-first general meeting, which is an important event in the political life of the party and party.
Promote the spirit of the great establishment of the Party, adhere to the overall direction of the work, fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development philosophy, accelerate the construction of new development patterns, open up the economy to new development, adhere to innovation driven development, promote the development of the economy, adhere to the main line of structural reforms on the supply side, coordinate epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, coordinate development and security, continue to do the "six-secure" and "six-safety" work, continuously improve people's lives, strive to stabilize the macroeconomic system, keep the economy running in reasonable areas, and maintain the stability of the social affairs, we will certainly be able to maintain a stable healthy economic environment, a social environment that is peaceful in the country, a political environment that is conducive to
Let us be more closely united around the Central Committee, which is centered on Comrade Xi Jinping, to strengthen the "four consciousnesses," to firmly "four confidences," to achieve the "two maintenances," to improve our political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution power, to deploy and implement the decision-making of the Central Committee in a practical manner, and to push forward the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

48 Hour Nuclear Acid Negative, Establish "Buffer Zone" State Council Joint Defense Joint Control Mechanism Requests Strengthening Port City Epidemic Control - Xinhua News Agency
Beijing, Dec 11 (China News Agency) - The State Council's Joint Counter-Terrorism and Control Mechanism (JCDM) issued a notice on strengthening counter-terrorism efforts in port cities to prevent new cases of pneumonia, demanding that persons leaving land border port cities (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) hold a negative certificate of nucleic acid testing within 48 hours and conduct at least one nucleic acid test after persons arriving at land border port cities.
According to the notification, the above-mentioned requirements shall be for a period of 15 March 2022, from the date on which the port city scope is determined and announced by the provincial and district municipalities.
In addition, the notification also suggests that conditional port cities may study the establishment of quarantine control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
For some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the people of both sides come and go frequently, the head of the disease prevention and control bureau of the National Health and Health Commission said.
With the implementation of the differential management policy, one out-of-control out-of-surplus line will be converted into two out-of-control lines. It is hoped that the out-of-control risk will be compressed, and the out-of-control effect will be achieved with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent years, there have been many local agglomerated epidemics in China, all of which have been imported through port cities.
The above-mentioned notifications pointed out that this exposed some issues such as inadequate early warning of local epidemic monitoring, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk positions for personnel, periodic flow of nucleic acid testing, inability to eliminate parts of cold chain items, inadequate management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific accuracy in emergency management of epidemic situations.
The notification requirement focuses on nine aspects, including improving the control mechanism of port city epidemics, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, speeding up the completion of the short-term weaknesses of port city control, not relaxing, scientifically accurate and good control work, and tightening the outer anti-input anti-line.
The notification emphasizes that port cities should conduct simultaneous research and deployment of epidemic prevention and protection work, publicize hotlines for the protection of civilians and provide them with free access to the hotlines, regularly investigate small-scale risks related to the supply of basic living materials and prices, and address and respond promptly to the outstanding issues reflected by the public.
According to the notification, the port cities referred to therein shall include open land, water and air ports in the county (city, district, flag), the city (county, state, coalition) and the city under direct jurisdiction, the specific scope of which shall be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities under direct jurisdiction) and notified in time in accordance with the need to prevent and control epidemics.

Oil pipe video reveals the truth of 20 years of American bloody slaughter - wikipedia.org
(Source: Oil Pipe)
On 11 December, a micro-documentary on the pipeline platform, titled Killing Machine, attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging war in Afghanistan under the name of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American democracy through the war, spending 20 years as a poor soldier, committing crimes against humanity such as the murder of innocent people, and sexual orientation.
Abuse of UAVs in civilian areas such as hospitals, schools, etc. distorts human nature and creates killers.
For 20 years, the US has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military established a "black prison" to torture and humiliate "the suspects".
A pile of crimes against humanity stirs up hatred for more Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terror” war is “more and more anti-terror.”
The war did not bring peaceful democracy, prosperity and hope to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless massacres.
Post the video, let's uncover the truth of America's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism," post the fake face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from a commercial point of view as well as from a conservation point of view about why the customer wants to help the logistics company in the tax area do the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, not to the operational scope of the tax logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do this?
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags are the same as the milk powder they are wearing, their raw materials are the same, no difference whatsoever.
So you might ask: Why is the warranty period of a bag one year, and the warranty period of a listening bag two years or more?
Or another question: Why is the price difference between listening and baggage so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mothers, think that it is because the raw materials are different that the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who respond after eating from this mentality and say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why it sounds expensive. Where is it?
Why are their raw materials the same and the differences so great?
Because most manufacturers when pricing take into account that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or no profits, what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So they have a huge rise in the price of their hearing equipment to secure their profit margins.
Therefore, most manufacturers are mainly pushing for hearing suits, not bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year. What's the cost?
You can all think about it.
So with the development of society, the cost of marketing in the market, for example: promotion staff in the market, the cost of display in the market, the cost of gifts of products, the cost of advertising, etc. is constantly increasing.
So every manufacturer is constantly adding new ones, and it's the earrings, their prices are also constantly rising, in fact it's the new ones that come with the increase of the market cost.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact their raw materials increase the cost at most won't exceed three or four dollars.
Some brands, in order to promote their products, choose to hook up with hospital doctors to help them promote their products, drawing profits ranging from $30 to $80 per listen.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not permitting such methods of operation, in fact the practice is harassing consumers.
It is advisable to buy packed milk powder in a can without having a can at home, so that you can save money, and increase the preservation and sealability of milk powder, and have no impact on children.
And don't think that the warranty period is longer than the bag. If the warranty period is the same after opening the bag, it's just that it's not easy to save the bag after opening the bag, and it's easy to get wet.

Don't scare people on the runway - wikipedia.org
When you go to the bookstore, you can often feel the explosion of successful school books.
Many of today’s successful textbooks proclaim the “best principle” – that is, first assume or imply that you can “do it” and then tell you “what” you need to do.
It's a matter of saying "how to do it" at once, the most important and fundamental part of it.
That’s why these books have one thing in common – either do the best they can at once, or do nothing at all; either 100, or 0; or climb Mount Tai, or just stay where you are.
This “best principle,” which everyone sees admits is “unbelievably right,” but 99% of people are scared to the runway.
Because this theory advocates the path of “you have to make a determination to be human again, to come to a 180-degree transformation,” which is the fatal weakness of many people.
For a man who keeps his customs, follows the old, and refuses to change, you must shout to his ears, "You must change," and you must deceive yourself, as you do to a cow's harp.
The vast majority of people will be frightened in front of the two words "transformation," unable to wrap their feet, unable to make a determination; or by a momentary impulse, pained the determination of "transformation," and bravely took the first step, but often not for a long time, persisted for a short time, and failed to see continuity.
Mr. Maillard's famous phrase "From Tomorrow onwards" is the most convincing expression of this classic of "universal humanity".
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people’s ability, making the vast majority of people “shout at the door.”
Perhaps the “second-best principle” is the only way to get more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the next-best principle lies in lowering the threshold – a principle that encourages a “win-win-win” approach, i.e., if you can’t do 100, you can only do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; and if you can’t climb Mount Tai, you can only climb a small sandy hill at your doorstep, because it’s always stronger than walking on the ground.
In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
As the threshold is significantly lowered, there is more chance that ordinary people will be able to stick to it, and the probability of success will increase as long as everything sticks to it.
The road to success is only a short one, following the principle of the next best.
Overall, the “best principle,” despite its apparent banner of success for all, can eventually motivate, in fact, a few; and the “second best principle,” can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake Nut Leather Resources Increase This Year by 0.71 Million - wikipedia.org
Xinhua News Agency ( Xinhua) reported on Monday (December 11) that the Qinghai Agricultural and Rural Office reported that the stockpile of carp in Qinghai Lake had increased by 0.71 million tonnes to 10.85 million tonnes year-on-year, more than 40 times as much as it had been at the beginning of 2002.
The naked carp of Qinghai Lake, commonly known as Huangfish, is a precious fish species specially found in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in the safety and biodiversity of the water-fish-bird ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of carnivorous carnivores in Qinghai Lake was drastically reduced, and the stock of carnivorous carnivores in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons in 2002.
In 2004, it was listed as a threatened species in the China Red List of Species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a sealed lake fishery, which prohibits any unit, collective or individual from fishing for carnivorous carnivores in the main rivers and tributaries of the Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibits the sale of carnivorous carnivores and their products.
At the same time, by means of artificial breeding discharge and cleaning up the main channels of the Qinghai Lake, designing scientifically reasonable "overfishing channels" and other measures, the conservation effort is continuously increased, and the stocks of carp in the Qinghai Lake are increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy head of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office in Qinghai province, said that up to now, Qinghai Lake carnivorous carnivorous carnivorous had been artificially breeded and discharged nearly 1.8 billion tails, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake carnivorous carnivorous resources.
The Qinghai Three River source area is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, while the Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls western desertification spreading eastward.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three River Basin and Lake Qinghai waters, protect aquatic wildlife, and preserve the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has since this year issued Notices of Prohibition of Key Areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lake Qinghai, and has built up a comprehensive system of prohibition management.

It's been an hour and it hasn't been delivered yet
It's too long to see an article that's an example.
Give the unknown man a copy.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first period of leave on a day between the ages of 13-15, closing in around the age of 50.
Afterwards, on the condition of good health, you will come regularly once a month.
But it's also not regular enough to predict accurately, about a week or so differences, need to be prepared in advance, sometimes bad luck will turn the car (suddenly several days ahead of schedule).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain varies from person to person, some for three days, some for a week; some for less flow, some for a big bleeding; some for no reaction, some for a ride to the ambulance, the pain will change with time.
Menstruation is uncontrollable and blood flows 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end of the days, which can only be done with a sanitary napkin or a sanitary cotton stripe to prevent it from flowing to the clothes chair.
Painful menstruation is mainly due to the secretion of the prostate, the physiological period has not come to the beginning of painful menstruation when fast to eat thrombin can effectively relieve the pain during the month, after the beginning of painful menstruation is no use to eat again.
Before the period of physiology, it is easy to pull the abdomen due to excessive release of uterine blood and prostate hormones.
If you're about to get your period, you'll get your menstrual period basically in two days.
Towels are best replaced once every two or three hours, otherwise they will easily infect bacteria, and apart from sleeping time, the worst case is replaced six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces, if you add 50 pieces of pre-prepared, not every month.
(Revised here, it's not necessary to change cotton routinely, it can be changed once for about 56 hours, for a maximum of eight hours)
Menstrual hormone poisoning may be more rabid, and menstrual periods may also be unsettled because of hormonal changes in the body, which is bad luck, the body makes itself a stumbling block.
But official crime figures show that women are still very good at controlling emotions, and that they don't take emotions for granted.
The flow is not just blood, which contains the absorption of the uterine membrane.
The membrane of the uterus is thin at the end of the menstrual cycle, and thickens slowly afterwards. It can be understood that the uterus is a house. Every month a house is built (the membrane thickens) to welcome guests.
Menstruation is uncomfortable, for decades, every few days 24 hours blood flow, and also abdominal and lumbar pain, who would like it?
But a person can be born because his mother comes through the menstruation, the menstruation is to prepare you for the first time in the world to live in a house for 10 months, everyone to thank your mother's regular health to come through the menstruation.
There was a lot of pressure on women in the past, and society thought it was dirty and shameful to wash women's brains, but the times have changed.
If someone feels sick of menstruation, feels that the woman's body is ill-prepared for the pregnancy life, shouldn't say in the public gallery, girls stand up, don't think so again, never experienced, never experienced, never understood men, don't forget the grace and goodness, how good it is to face your mother, how good it is to want your children?
Finally, sisters, try out the sanitary pad. It's really good.
It's winter to the holidays, and it's disappointing to make mistakes
To order another meal for the children
I hope you'll check it out in the busy shops
Is the foot bath bubble foot scarf leaked electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath can play a good foot therapy health role, today the U.S. government officials will answer the question, hoping to help friends.
As people's health awareness increases, bathtubs are becoming more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of products of different grades are also emerging in the market. From hundreds of thousands to thousands of dollars bathtubs are full, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional household electricity, the sale of health-care household electricity such as bathtubs, but bathtubs do not have specialized industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to bump your feet in electric water!
Mr. Li told reporters recently that he bought a bathtub for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt a nausea when he bathed his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the bathtub, did not expect to turn off the vibration function, but the father still feels the bottom of the foot.
Mr. Li tried the pen, and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub had electricity.
Later he contacted the merchants, and the merchants' attitude was good, and Mr. Li was still uncomfortable despite withdrawing from the bathtub.
Because he found that this long-popular bathtub now lacks a clear and detailed industry regulation on the setting of the highest temperature, what kinds of people and what kinds of materials guarantee harmlessness.
But in general, bathtubs will not have electrical problems, but also exclude a few products from strictly closed when leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose a separate bathtub when purchasing.
Water-electric separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a pencil measurement at will.

Metaphysics refers to the study of questions that cannot be answered directly through intuition through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the fundamental law of philosophy, aimed at explaining the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of the word "formal physics" is derived from the phrase "formal means, forms and instruments," which was translated from metaphysics by Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji period) of Japan.
The branch of metaphysics includes body theory, natural theology and its extension, etc.
In essence, "the study of what nouns represent real entities and what nouns merely represent a concept."
A metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is that all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, presented by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Method naturalism refers to the method of study of God without a single word.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies consciousness and its intrinsic relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and one-dimensionalism are the two main ideas for discussing the relationship between the mind and the body.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that discusses the nature, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the discipline of systematic thinking and study of human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the norms of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It consists mainly of primary ethics (abstract study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism), normative ethics (assessment of various ethical views, and recommendation of ethical norms for right or wrong conduct).
It investigates what kinds of moral codes of conduct should be observed by people), applied ethics (applying ethics theory to real life situations, including biological ethics, political ethics, etc.), and described ethics (collecting information about how people live and summarizing it from observed patterns).
It examines the ethical views held by social groups, not from the hypothetical viewpoint, but from the actual choices made and observed by moral agents, which contribute to all the ethical factors involved in these choices.
The history of ethics includes Greek Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanistism, represented by Varla and Montau and others.
Part two: The ethical thinking of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18th century, British empirical ethics, represented by Hume, 17-18th century, European rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza, 18th century, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire, 18-19th century, German Academy ethics, represented by Kant and Hagel, 18-19th century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Siquiwick, 19th century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, late 19th century, German New Kantian ethics, represented by Lee Kahler, late 19th century, New Hagel ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.), transitional ethics (non-rational ethics, represented

A friend of mine.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian assistance they have provided us during the long period of 30 years since the deaths of our relatives, especially the humanitarian assistance that has not been interrupted so far since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad at the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' parents have died and the orphans have grown up to be employed.
Your acts of kindness have helped our troubled families through the most difficult times.
The new pandemic is now sweeping the globe and most donors have retired over the years.
Therefore, I implore you to suspend the humanitarian contributions of the Tiananmen Mothers' Group, which should have been the perfect slogan.
I will remember your love forever, and I am convinced that your righteousness will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
May I take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Federation of American Studies (IFCSS) and the China Democratic Foundation of Minnesota (MCDF) in humanitarian relief.
In the course of its humanitarian rescue activities, the All-American Institute of Self-Government and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project implementers are often intertwined.

rescue funds often fail to reach the hands of sixty-four refugees.
In 1994, Mr. Cheng Tin recommended that a special group be set up by the Mother of Tiananmen to coordinate and coordinate the receipt and distribution of aid funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Sixty-Four orphan Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later, and in 2009, after all sixty-four orphans graduated from university, the MCDF subsequently established the Sixty-Four orphan orphans special help fund, which has been implemented to this day.
These projects are funded mainly from campus and community contributions during the sixty-fourth year, from generous contributions from individuals, and supported by the Fraternity University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Research Foundation for Labour Transformation.
Until last year, 31 years later, 64 refugees finally received a portion of their donations from Hong Kong in the name of 64.
During this period, Human Rights also carried out their humanitarian relief projects independently.
We understand that Mr. Dean's call to stop 64 donations is in the interests of the donors, and we are indeed a number of retired old people whose income is not as good as before retirement, and we would like to thank Mr. Dean's letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the refugees to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
Thank you and pay tribute to those heroic and courageous comrades who have persisted for years in giving generously and at the risk of delivering humanitarian aid.

Thank you for the rabbit's comment. It was also said that rejection of old fashion is not suitable for old fashion. I didn't think the finished product was so beautiful
Thanks to Dan Dan's approval, your satisfaction will keep us charged and moving forward, and we'll keep pumping!
This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend everyone to come!
From reception, make-up, clothing, lights, photography to the latter, there is no choice.
Make-up artists are specially sophisticated, will match your style to suit your make-up, cosmetics are also used in the first line of major brands.
Not to mention that Mr. Tan Liang is a very professional photographer.
The whole studio has a very artistic atmosphere, and two little cats accompanying play.
We're working in Beijing, and the best cinemas in Beijing need to be scheduled six months in advance, and my colleagues have shot in Beijing, and I think it's just so so.
Specially looking for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expressions are poorly managed, and I think this is the short version for most people. Photographer Liang Guo captures and captures naturally beautiful moments.
Make-up artist, photographer, late-stage design, a great team.
We and everyone around us are very much in favour of it.
I've already recommended the girl before, and the girl just watched the footage is also full of joy.
I hope that this kind of studio doesn't get buried, and that more people find ta and make it in their own style, rather than the whole thing.
Thank you very much for the five-star rating given to Owl and Kei Ling, both of whom are very creative and creative newcomers, and we are creative studios, as long as customers like us, we will do our utmost to complete, and thank you for meeting each other
A sweet and helpful assistant, and a lively and enthusiastic photographer teacher, everyone in the team is supernice. It was a beautiful shoot, an unforgettable experience, and the result was much better than I could have imagined. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much.
Thank you for your feedback. It's also a reason to know you. From Hook and Hook to Qin, our trust is thousands of kilometers. I'm very happy to know you. It's a chance to come to Qin again next time
How do I get the money?

No rider receiver
Now the restaurant clerk calls me
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you're going to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money and takes six months to learn.
But if you're going to get into the industry, training is really a good choice, especially for those with self-restraint and weakness, and training is a good choice.
If you have more self-restraint, you can choose to learn by yourself, just to be more tired.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, look at the teachers' strength of the institution, if the teachers' strength is not strong enough, the training institute is meaningless, of course some newly opened training institutes teachers' strength is not particularly strong.
Secondly, you should look for the institution before you choose. It's best to look for the students who come out of the institution. After all, only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, whether the course is good or bad.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question, because there's no introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you live in, all have to do with the profession you are studying or wanting to pursue.
If you're a student and haven't graduated or have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, a lot of online training organizations are actually very good, but it's expensive to learn and it takes a lot more time, and it basically takes 3-6 months to train.
But if I say these things, self-study is convenient. Now a lot of learning resources on the web are free, or go to b site also a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me through a profile, get free resources, or get detailed advice.
There are also some more classical books that combine video composite learning.
If you are not a computer specialist, but can also pay for a certain amount of learning money and time, then it is advisable to study in a training institution, so that learning does not take a lot of effort, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and someone specializes in answering them, and there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
And now a lot of training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal appointments, and after study recommend to the company, so that the interview process after finding a job can save a lot of things.
These are some of my points of view. Since I don't know what you're talking about, I'm not going to give you any details. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said it was 1 o'clock, and I saw the app
What's your name
I haven't finished. What are you doing?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall hanging stove heater, clean water, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove head, oil tobacco machine, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional sewing, domestic service
Thank you to those who gave me a silent applause and fought hard to live a very tired life but to continue
Life won't be worthless to every hard worker, so just pay attention to me and thank those who give me a silent compliment
Life is like this, others only see the result, self-support the process, face life, we are only strong, continue, have no choice, the way can look back but can not go back ...
Maintenance is a job, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of heart.
Cleaning Although we do the dirtiest work, but we will clean every corner of the customer house with the most serious attitude, see the customer's happy smile and raised thumb, that moment all the tired is worth it, pay for it always has a return!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
Mindful service, mindful cleansing, keeping good.
The details you care about, Feng Gui's family will help you to do "clean" I can, service the family.
Clean houses, tree houses, stone, service in place, clean to the house.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily job
Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it can be dim without cleaning for a long time. It is only after cleaning that it can shine, and so is life
Careful work can succeed, with careful craftsmanship, fine sewing we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, you will surely be satisfied, quality means everything, because the professional deserves to be trusted, your acknowledgment is my most encouraged!
Every business in the present day is not doing well!
But I've always believed that as long as I'm serious enough, persistent enough, hard enough, I'll be a little better than anybody else, at least I'll always be stronger than sitting complaining!
The plan of the day is to start in the morning, and all the good starts in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and good intentions. Have a good day
As a child, happiness is a thing, it is happiness to have; as a grown-up, happiness is a goal, it is happiness to achieve; as a grown-up, it is discovered that happiness is a mindset, it is happiness to understand.
Be the most true and the most kind of yourself, act according to heart, no regret in this life; life one way, walk your own way; two treasures of life: good body, good heart, beautiful and bright life to old age!
At every stage of life, there are different difficulties.
Often, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more afraid you are, the more difficult it will be to overcome; and if you face difficulties, the problem will be solved.
China's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art held in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency
The first two-year exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh JAX Art Area, opened to the public on November 11 in the northwestern Saudi capital of Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries participating.
The two-year exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Arabian Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yulens Contemporary Art Center of China.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the two-year exhibition is “Through the River, Touching Stones,” which symbolizes the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transition and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The two-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, represented in six units: Touching the Stones Over the River, Inheritance as an Experiment, Border Thinking, Going to the Public, Beautiful New World, and The Spirit of Art.
Among them, 27 Saudi artists represented more than a quarter of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation and performing arts; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, some using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Jiao's reconstruction of a classic mountain water painting with waste materials in the series The Endless Mountains behind the Tale (2014).
"We hope that the two-year exhibition will create an international dialogue and give global audiences an opportunity to get to know Saudi Arabia's booming cultural industries and creative communities and strengthen interactions," said Barclay, CEO of the Dubai Biennial Exhibition Foundation.
“The goal of the two-year exhibition is twofold: to bring Saudi contemporary art into the global dialogue and to bring Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art,” said Taqiu.
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the two-year opening week. Artists, exhibitors and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordination and Standardization of Rural Public Employment Management - Xinhua News Agency
Kunming, Xinhua News Agency (December 12, China) - In an effort to continue helping people out of poverty by helping them find jobs and consolidating the success of the fight against poverty, the province of Yunnan has recently adopted a policy to promote rural revitalization and the management of public-interest jobs in rural areas, helping to promote rural revitalization in a comprehensive manner.
According to the officials of the Office of Social Welfare of Yunnan Province, there are currently 44.83 million rural public service jobs being developed in Yunnan, which are used to accommodate the employment of rural hard-pressed groups, such as the labor force, to help the people out of poverty achieve employment gains, consolidate the achievements of the struggle against poverty, and effectively enhance the capacities of all public services in the countryside.
The new regulations will be issued jointly by the seven departments of Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, and Finance, and will mainly provide uniform standards on the scope, fund management, job development, and job management of rural public service personnel recruited at the grass-roots level.
With regard to the establishment of posts, the new rules clarify the establishment of posts in accordance with the principles of "posting, posting, dynamic management, total control" "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one-on-one, voluntary open, unified management".
The recruitment procedure must be conducted in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, verification, publicity, recruitment, pre-employment training and the arrangement of lay-off.
Furthermore, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public service posts, the standards of subsidies for rural public service posts, and the method of subsidies. They stipulate that the development departments of rural public service posts should purchase business insurance for accidental injury for the settlers of rural public service posts and require the relevant departments to monitor the distribution of subsidies for rural public service posts on a regular basis.

Hello
Can I cancel my order

Although the right-wing party has had a time of ambition in history, but not long, so short because to give a little sunshine is brilliant, to drink a little water is sweating; to have a little ambition is to look at Luo and Shu, to be hit is to be covered with fur.
But in reality, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the right should not be denied in terms of defining the standards of truth, developing the economy, improving technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not entirely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect this man; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that it is counter-needed revolution, which will inevitably lead to social instability, to the destruction of people's livelihoods, to the disintegration of political groups, and to foreign interference.
Change or improve China must be patient and responsible for its people. Political speculators are not right-wing, they are rogue.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of time and politics dropouts.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to the right's speeches and analyse their thoughts when necessary, then the left will not do this, because what the left wants is the rotten garbage thrown away by the Communist Party!
Recently I've seen some of my friends fighting against the thieves and fighting left-handedly, and it's very moving, and I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to make sense of adultery and left-handedness. It's all a thread. It's unreasonable.
And don't try to prove that we're right, and don't think about getting the anti-theft and the left-wing to admit it, why not?
I tell my friends this: when anti-theft slanders you five hairs, when left mad slanders you right dog, just proves our middle way is right!
Many people also had ideals when they were young, and when they were old, they forgot them, or pursued them, and became prejudiced.
And the ideals go farther and farther, and even the killer boy ends up as the evil dragon.
Left and Right I think generally refers to constraints and freedom, China's genes from historical culture leading to China as a whole should be left.
In the country, the right is free, focusing on efficiency and development, and the left is strengthening regulation, focusing more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to fairness, while the US-China conflict, the left-wing is positive, is expected to last for many years.
Even though I don't understand, a compliment is enough
I didn't say anything. Flowers are so loyal
For nearly two years, the blockade and blockade of Huawei's chips has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but has also caused enormous losses to "American" companies.
The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in the reduction of R&D investment and capacity of the chip manufacturing enterprises, and thus the shortage of the chip supply chain throughout the world.
The shortage of core has now spread to major industries around the world, such as automotive plants, mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have been hit.
In order to gain the autonomy of "chips," more and more state-owned tech giants are on their way to " beautifying."
In an effort to tighten global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the U.S. recently hosted the "Chip Summit" and invited 64-nation giants to form a semiconductor alliance and raise funds to support US-based tech giants, such as MIT's oldest technology giant, Intel, to reclaim its dominance in the chip industry by investing $200 billion in two crystallization plants in the US state of Arizona and opening up its chip replacement business.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the pile of electricity, it was likely to rob the pile of electricity's "dining room".
The reason for this is that Intel, as the oldest technology giant in the U.S., has spent decades in the semiconductor field, and has a large talent pool and technological reserve, is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat pile-up electricity.
However, for Intel's decision, the founder of MP3, Zhang Chung, did not care.
At the 2021 Master Intelligence Forum, held in April, Zhang Zhuang expressed surprise at the move to fund Intel's chip factory. Zhang Zhuang said without hesitation: Intel's chip replacement factory is rather ironic.
The reason why Zhang Chung was so disrespectful of Intel's entry into the crystalline field was that Zhang Chung still had a grudge against Intel over 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the world's leading manufacturer of semiconductors.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been dominated by a few powerful ones.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by an IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured, and sealed by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model puts a heavy burden on some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are faced with enormous cost of production line construction.
In response to market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labour and cooperation, in 1984 Zhang Chung-chung heard of a company specializing in chip design, and thought that since there is a company specialized in design, then a factory specialized in making crystals could be established.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang's idea became a reality, and the accumulated electricity was born.
The main focus of the company's business is on the single-stage processing of crystals. It does not design, but provides a substitute service for crystal-making.
The newly-created stand-up electricity was small in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chung had sought Intel's investment, but when Intel heard it was only a chip industry manufacturing link, obviously some self-esteem was too high, couldn't see it, and decided to refuse to invest in it.
Zhang Chung-ju also determined that Intel was unable to see the crystalline processing service at the time.
I didn't expect to see a giant crystal manufacturing service back then, but now I'm going to start doing crystal replacement.
So, Zhang Chung thought it was ironic that Intel entered the process of turning crystals.
The market value of standby electricity has now exceeded that of Intel.
In the face of a powerful attack of the accumulated electricity, Intel naturally did not dare to stand firm.
Today, the accumulator is already plugged into 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.
I'm not waiting
It's two hours before 19:06
Let's look at some strange hot searches today.
What is a normal mood?
Three hot searches were randomly chosen: the February 2 rise of the dragon, the price hike of good friends, the freight rush event, and the spread of euphoria to form a wave peak, and then the [index decline] (the smooth curve) finally dissipated, and if there were a second euphoria, there would be a small hummingbird peak again.
They appear to be no different from the "model of evolution of online emotions" that has been presented on the website of the Internet Trust Agency.
What is an unusual feeling?
A random selection of six heat searches in the same event reveals isolated peaks, serrated teeth, and cliffs.
A single-peak heater is a person who heats up a list of topics quickly to attract public attention; a saw-tooth heater is a cyclical heater that ensures the topic is on the hot search list; and a cliff-shaped heater is a collective withdrawal in which the hot search performs its functions, receives new tasks, and races to new battlefields.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the wave valley of another event, no matter how long it takes, and it must be the unified battalion of naval forces that receives the task of launching a new offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations is visible: dozens of hot searches simultaneously on the list, which attracts the eye, which is responsible for coping, which attracts the momentum of war, which transfers vision, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotion, which wraps up decision-making, black production accounts batch by batch, sub-section by sub-section fine-tuning combat, almost taking into account all the elements in the dissemination of public opinion.
Dissemination is a science that leaves out all the subjective factors of position and emotion, only from objective data, and black public relations are nowhere to hide.
Anyone who passes will leave a mark, and we will dig it out together.

The first case of Omicron-infected strains was discovered in countries such as Mauritius.
Beijing, Dec 12 (China News Agency) - Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported for the first time the discovery of new cases of Omicron strains infected with the crown variant virus.
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of the country's Omicron-infected strain on October 10.
According to Malawi Health Minister Kailash Jagutpal, one infected person was a tourist arriving in Mauritius from South Africa on 27 November; the other infected person was a Mauritian resident who was positively tested for nucleic acid on 30 November after contacting a person who had recently returned to South Africa.
After hospital isolation, the results of the nucleic acid tests of the two infected patients were converted to negative, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced on 10 October the country's first diagnosis of three cases of Omicron infection.
All three were students who returned from a trip abroad earlier this month and were not admitted to hospital due to their mild illness.
In order to prevent the spread of Omicron poisoning, the government of Cyprus has been stepping up its controls.
From 6 December to 10 January next year, passengers over the age of 12 who board an airplane will be required to undergo a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense after they are delayed.
The Seychelles Ministry of Health also announced on October 10 that the country would begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the new Whirlpool vaccine.
Malawi's Minister of Health, Quembize Chiponda, said on 9 July that the country had first detected three cases of Omicron infections.
The country's health department conducted genome sequencing of 12 new coronary-positive samples collected from 9 November to 2 December and found the three cases of infection.

American 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12/F, Happiness House, 156 South Road, Ring Town
At first it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to look at at the beginning My budget is 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
The first time I went to the store, I just showed them my profile, they didn't actually measure the house, they were able to give me a quote that 70,000 of my 135 houses could be done, and I probably looked at their materials and didn't know what brand they were using.
Their second trick is to drag you out of the shop as soon as you get to the store (and once you get the money you'll never come back unless you've had enough experience fighting them theoretically).
When I'm hesitant to make a deposit, they invite their so-called managers to tell you how much discount we can give you today if you make the deposit.
This is a big pit, and I'm a living example of being deceived, giving out more than 10,000 deposits when my mind is busy.
He offered me 70,000 without electricity, without any doors, without any cabinets, without any bathrooms, and these three were the most expensive of the basics.
Aside from these, their service points charge is higher than that of other companies.
I lost my trust in the company and didn't say anything clearly at the beginning so I signed the contract.
When I went to find them to pay back, they showed a lot of experience, a specialized small team to deal with you.
It's a customer's problem to bite a deadly bite in any way. They're completely irresponsible.
All kinds of discharge of responsibility, there are many details, I don't want to say all the tears, in any case don't choose them, because my friends are looking for them to decorate the house is also bad quality, later on you calculate all kinds of costs.
Father, they were the dragon-head decoration of the deceiver, and now they're beautiful, as if they've collapsed and become something else.
So don't all choose to go to the dad's decoration company like this.
Later, when people choose Baidu to look at these check out these advisories because decoration is not a small money.

I asked if it could be canceled within 15 minutes

As the last major meteor shower this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the meteor shower in the constellation of Saturn, will be a big one on December 14, Xinhua news agency reported on Monday (December 12), adding that friends who like meteor showers can observe it later in the night.
A meteor shower in Qinghai, China, photographed on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor shower's parent objects are periodic comets, but the meteor shower's parent object in the constellation is the asteroid 3200 Faeroth, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
It is also the second known meteor shower not to be "born" by comets.
Shui Li Peng, director of the Tianjin City Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy science and technology, explained that, as with the Happy Birthday films, the meteor showers usually appear at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteoric rain is known for its large and stable flow, and is known as the three major meteoric rains in the northern hemisphere, together with the meteoric rains of the Equator and the meteoric rains of Perseus.
A remarkable feature of the meteor showers in the constellation is the slow speed of the meteor body, rich in color, and many Mars meteors, suitable both for sight and for astronomy photographers to take photographs.
Tianjin Astronomy Enthusiast Yang Jian On December 13, 2020, a meteor shower in the constellation Tianjin was shot in Tianjin.
This year's meteor showers are expected to reach a peak at around 15 o'clock on December 14, when the maximum ZHR (in ideal conditions, the amount of meteors visible per hour when the radiation point is right above the top of the head) is 150.
Tropical rain in the constellation recommended index graph.
"Last year, people were deeply impressed by the moonlight, but this year's moonlight will interfere with the rain, and it will be a little less dramatic.
The bright moonlight interferes with the observations, so that the moon falls at midnight, and the radiation point of the meteor shower rises at this time.
A friend who likes meteor showers can observe the moon in the hours after midnight, but be careful to keep warm in case of cold.”
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city, but in the suburbs or in the countryside, you can choose a high altitude, low light, wide-angle view to the northeast, and wait patiently for the moon to come down for sighted observation.
It should be noted that the flow of meteor showers to all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiation point of meteor showers.
If a friend who likes to take photographs wants to shoot a beautiful "flying star rain movie," it's best to choose a wide-angle, large-circle lens, using high ISO and maximum-circle lens.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries, and high-speed lines are also essential.”
Shu Li Peng reminded me.
What are the differences between laser television and traditional television in market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional television should refer to LCD television, whereas the difference between laser and LCD television in market positioning is mainly due to the following two points:
First, laser television is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared to the full-fledged market positioning of LCD television, laser television clearly focuses more on the large screen market, or laser television itself is a product of the large screen.
Currently, the main LCD television sizes range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while laser television sizes are typically greater than 75 inches, the largest exceeding 100 inches, to fully satisfy users' demands for large screen displays.
In recent years, the volume and sales share of laser televisions worldwide have been increasing steadily, accounting for more than 60% of total TV sales of 80 inches and more.
According to Yi-King's forecast, sales growth in the laser television market will exceed 140 per cent in 2020 and will continue to grow at a fast pace.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye care.
Based on the principle of laser television reflection, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly hit the eyeball, compared with the back light emitted by LCD television, the process is closer to the process of imaging of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Sisi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the eye specialists of the Beijing Co-operative Hospital have obtained 144 sets of test data through a rigorous comparison test of laser television and LCD television viewed in the same conditions in the population.
The data confirms that laser television does have strong eye protection characteristics and even has some improvement effect in certain areas.
In the present time of increasing attention to vision health, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in color television market.
Second, laser television is more focused on the high-end market.
In contrast to LCD TV prices are constantly falling, the price of laser TV sold in the market is mostly more than $10,000, with the increase in size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser television so expensive?
There's no doubt that it makes sense.
With the development of light source and technology, laser television has many advantages that LCD television and projection cannot realize.
With the use of ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser television is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, and can achieve a 100-inch screen experience in a short distance, requiring little space, and the mainframe is small, occupying very little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser televisions can reach more than 2,000 brightnesses.
Additionally, thermal output is lower, equipment is less damaged, and television life is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models also have built-in real 4K ultra-high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence systems, simulated screens, etc., leading-edge technologies that can give users a more shocking listening experience.
It's not about fake demand, it's about the product that needs to be subdivided, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser television is not the menu of the video and audio players, want to take into account the large screen and watch the environment inadequate, can try, everything is advantageous and disadvantageous, after weighing it out, can judge itself, is afraid to listen to one word.
In short, the ultra wide-angle near-focus projector, the laser television, has to use expensive ultra wide-angle lenses and reflectors in order to attach to the screen, which is not the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of a microstructured finel screen is expensive, with an 80-inch screen essentially replaced by a 65-inch LCD.
Also, I particularly hate the projector manufacturer to take a long reflection to the eye to sell this kind of thing, please, the light that the eye can see on the curtain is directed to the eye, you reflect to the ceiling, the eyes can't see, unless the real LCD TV is also long "directed", open the ceiling doesn't also light up?
And if the projection screen is not reflective, it doesn't make a picture at all.
It is precisely ignored the heat spot effect of high-performance screen cloth, at a certain angle a large amount of light reflects to the eyes, that is really hard to accept.
Photography and Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Selected Quality Shops There are no branches for the time being
Additionally, the date of the reservation on WeChat, the little sister will send me the optional time schedule, the reply information is more timely ~
Before I went to see the filming works in the shop, it's more outdoor wedding dresses, it's very beautiful, and there's a lot of shooting style involved.
After the day arrived, I simply exchanged my ideas with my little sister, very patiently helped me try out two sets of style clothes I fixed, and finally decided to start make-up modeling - the photographer will set up some tools before shooting, will guide the action, and will be more careful with each detail.
But maybe because I don't have any specific shooting ideas to share with you, it's not the style I want, but it should be nice.
After shooting, the photographer will help to select the photos, communicate the late style, feel very careful.
It takes about half a month for a good film to be repaired.
The second was a photo-style heap-eating event where most of the clothes on the scene could be chosen for one shot.
Finally, I chose a black dress and experienced a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, make-up + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the brother after 95, it feels a little bit darker, I hope to be able to give more advice in the direction of customers shooting action afterwards ~ pretty talkative, the shooting process is more enjoyable.

It's on the front page. Come and seeQueenie too.
When you get to the store, fill in the phone number and then choose clothes, wedding dresses can be chosen, change three or four sets of clothes is very patient, choose after makeup for a long time, service attitude is good, after the shooting will teach you how to put on the look, it feels like the face is big, the repair says it is half a month, it comes out in three or four days, it feels like there is no difference to the original film
[Environment] The whole thing is fine.
There are plenty of clothes to choose from.
There are almost three makeup locations, and behind them is a photo booth.
Very enthusiastic and very attentive.
The model is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you very carefully how to move.
Unhappy, the photographer will also offer to make a backup.
[Experience] There may have been a bit of oversimplification, the original double-eyed skin was glued to the tri-eyed skin.
The eyebrows are also shaved, a little embarrassing for not drawing eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo was given ten days ago, but the P graphics were not very satisfactory, and I felt that the eyelids were still very visible.
Because it's not clear what style it's going to be. Try two sets and pick one or choose a black dress. The little sister says it's more hip than the old one
The hairdresser and the make-up artist, the little sister, are very patient in helping me to get the results very satisfied
I started to take pictures after getting my make-up and hair. The photographer was in charge of my posture all the way. The process was easy and harmonious
After finishing the film, I carefully selected the four favorites, and the younger brother said that he made 15 films. The ending was very satisfactory.
Since your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
Strangely enough, I use the same credit card every time I pay
I have to pay for shipping every time
Can I get an exemption before you investigate and collect my monthly fees?
Is it reasonable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance brokerage platform.
In terms of the terms of establishment: According to the Guidelines for the Regulation of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Amendment of 2015), to become an insurance brokerage company, it is necessary to meet three key words: shareholders, initiators have no significant illegal records in the last three years, a minimum amount of RMB 5,000,000 can be established, and must have the approval of the China Insurance Supervisory Board.
These three rules are actually very strict, summed up to be strong, to be approved by the national authority department of the Banking Supervisory Board (which regulates insurance companies and banks in the country) and shareholders to have a good style, as an insurance broker company umbrella insurance, the insurer is not too much to doubt whether umbrella insurance is regular or not, after all there are these three thresholds, no insurance company can reach.
In this respect, it's good, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies are selling stars' sickness insurance on this platform, such as the newest and Tai Super Mary 5 sickness insurance, the claimant and insurer are all Tai Life, umbrella insurance is only a third-party intermediary, there is no doubt it's reliable.
From the payment mode: Internet platform products, because of the reduced operating costs of business networks, and the cost of business staff, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, supporting monthly payment, relieving the insurer's payment pressure, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Think about it.
This is especially important because insurance is a profession that demands a great deal of professionalism, and many customers of Internet products can make their own insurance. This creates a lot of misunderstandings. In the area of health information and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness to insurance, feeling healthy or fit, and there are a lot of risks of compensation, and risks of rejection.
I myself have been selling insurance phones at Tencent Microinsurance (like the umbrella, which is also an Internet insurance broker platform), and I am very responsible to tell you.
Internet insurance is true, and reliable, and unreliable is people, Internet channels are not professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are easy to avoid, and they don't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, the next month will be charged according to the normal rate, dozens to 200 won't wait, and many customers will be deducted for a year or two for what they buy.
Thinking it could cost a dollar, the insurance company claimed $6 million (the world lost pies).
Free mobile phones are sent at the end of a special warranty, such as 6666,8888, and if the winner sends a text message, it is not exchanged and no one is reminded.
(This is another pitfall for the policyholders) Free 60,000 sickness insurance is a short term, and if it's just this, there's no other business risk, and in the event of a serious illness, 60,000 can't do anything, can't solve the problem, and life begins to run wild.
Currently, the country has been severely punished for misleading internet insurance sales.
So overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professionalism of the operator.
In fact, many underground insurance brokerage companies have more products, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to save 2000-3000 yuan per year on products under coverage.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I:Mingya Insurance broker, have 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serves over thousands of enterprise users, cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from the customer's needs, customize insurance products for the customer, in the insurance, for the customer's goods more than three, strive for the best verification results for the customer, after insuring, arrange the insurance bills for the customer, maintain the insurance bills, let the customer rest assured.
Grow up with every client for life.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insurer can independently complete all the insurance processes after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, nor does the insurance consultant, and all the steps can be completed by the insurer on his own.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not so " ritualistic" and may not even have printed paper contracts, it does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of electronic contracts in the slightest.
This model is a bit like the telephone sales business, but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance, which is that follow-up services may not follow.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we not think carefully about this intermediary that we choose, an insurance intermediary that can accompany us for a long time and also provide us with services many years later?
So how can I get in touch with the catering clerk
It's almost 3 o'clock
Isn't that compensation for me

Thank you for your help
From before to now, I have opposed any form of contempt and slander, and I cannot accept such acts of personal attack any more.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but it is to put an end to this villain.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, it's this uncivilized style that you have to resist first.
I've been reluctant to respond from the time you started to send me face-to-face requests with friends and then post funny posts, to the time you tried to post my so-called home and father's name on social media.
You've become more and more intense, not just on the frequency of six meals a day, but on the face-book with your so-called friends, discussing with reluctance some obscure, shameful words about me, looks, bodies, well-being, what strawberries to plant in bed, what not to put in, and so on, and so on.
How did I know that I'd later receive a number of friends posting a photo of you and sexually harassment contents on my friend's account about your profile.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After the news of my alarm, you didn't converge at all. Instead, you got more and more furious.
I don't care what your political background is, and no matter what your status, in our society, there is a need for bisexual respect.
Yes, you can continue to say that you are just loving and caring for me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that this is not your drawing, or you can continue to make all kinds of offensive statements.
Yeah, I can't and I can't stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body don't need your comment.
I don't even think any girl would want someone to shame herself so much in exchange for a name.
My friend asked me, are you all right?
I said good. you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being so bully.
Whether in the workplace, in society, in politics or in business, only those who have no basic morality will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that morality is self-evident.
I've cut out some of my messages for you to comment on
Your own post shouldn't be taken for granted
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization
A smile of heart

Full coverage of the Green Integrated Service Area on the Yangtze River - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan, Dec 11 (China News Agency) - The Fuling Water Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing City was officially opened for operation on December 10, the second green integrated service area upstream of the Yangtze River, following the opening of the Liuzhou Water Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan Province on December 8.
So far, the water-based green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle and lower Yangtze Rivers.
According to the deputy director of the Changjiang Shipping Authority, the Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Keunghua said that the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already built 10 integrated water-based green services along the middle and lower sides of the Yangtze River, and had received the approval of a large number of shipowners, which played an important role in promoting the Changjiang shipping.
The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the capacity of the Yangtze River ships to receive pollution and provide shipping services has been significantly improved.
According to the report, the integrated water-based green service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services to the vast majority of ships and crews, and to help the vast majority of crews solve the problem of "urgent difficulty and despair".
The two integrated water-based green service areas on the upper bank of the Yangtze River, which will bring together life services, production services and administrative services, with a green environmental theme, ship maintenance and ship emergency rescue services, will achieve the "one-stop-shop, multiple-services" in Hong Kong, which will make the vessels operating in the Yangtze River on a regular basis work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
Three U.S. carriers gather around China The most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam 22-01-17 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
On January 9, the satellite spotted the U.S. carrier Carl Vinson near the Barabakh Strait, according to China's intelligence agency, the South China Strategy Situation Sensing Platform.
The Barabakh Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the first chain of islands in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy Car Wilson to the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the Carrier Carrier Wilson, carrying F-35C fighter aircraft and CMV-22 "Fish Eagle" transport aircraft.
American carriers are now sailing over the Pacific, with the exception of the Car Wilson carrier and the Abraham Lincoln carrier departing from the United States on January 3.
Lincoln also first boarded the F-35C Carrier Squadron, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Assault Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to these two carriers, the US Navy is currently deploying USS Ronald Reagan in the Asia-Pacific region, stationed in Yokohama, Japan.

The most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. fleet of carriers CMV-22B flew the route.
One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam on a rare occasion last weekend, according to CNN
USS Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base at Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Three US carriers gather around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
It was the first US ballistic missile submarine to visit Guam since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US carriers gather around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guangdong China has built a large number of military facilities in the South Sands in recent years.
The picture shows China's long-term hot islands in the South Sands.
(South China Research Forum) The US Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada strengthened cooperation between the US and its regional allies, demonstrating US capabilities, flexibility, readiness to fight, and sustained commitment to the security and stability of the Indian region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarine".
The tracking of 14 of the U.S. Navy's torpedo submarines is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine makes the Thunderbolt the "most important surviving weapon in the nuclear triangle", a system that includes well-propelled ballistic missiles on the mainland of the United States and bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads, such as the B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to friends about the recent 26 per cent drop in the Meta stock market and a $25 trillion evaporation, Zackberg said he was "confronted with unprecedented competition" and why.
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, with revenues coming mainly from advertising, and now the advertising company that makes money today, itself has a flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever function location, are Meta's traffic channels.
Moreover, Meta is the largest "advocacy alliance", with many apps externalizing Meta's ads and implementing transformations through Meta's advertising platform.
But the times have changed.
First, because of Apple’s privacy policy adjustment, Meta is finding it difficult to retrieve data from users, affecting the effectiveness of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and will clearly indicate whether users allow the app to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google presses another knife, the impact on Meta’s revenues will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta’s previous revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of which is uncertain, but it does exist).
It is commonly known that Meta does not operate in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenues come from China, mainly from companies contributing to China's maritime business.
Meta has about a hundred offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in the mainland.
China's companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is an insurmountable advertising channel, most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of the dictionary is now one of Meta's main competitors, but in the last two years Meta has made a lot of money from the dictionary.
All the agencies in the country are helping the dictionary to Meta to advertise there, and Meta Greater China Region's performance is also good.
I haven't been studying it much lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale overseas burning of money by Chinese companies has passed.
Third, the new flow channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets are not just looking at middle incomes, but more importantly at the prospects of the future.
Obviously, Meta’s expectations are not sufficient.
To tell the market a new story Zackberg talked about the universal.
True, the meta-universe should be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of the meta-universe is longer, and this story should not be enough to support Meta’s market capitalization in the next two or three years.
So the next two years should be more difficult for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook. It's very popular now, and it earns between $1,000 billion and $2,000 billion a year. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis, and compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there's nothing like a safe city river.
Although some of his social software is now more advanced, and is the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but faced with the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and the turnaround is a blink of an eye.
This is why Zackberg has changed his company name and is continuing to look for a new track, but I think his track choice is wrong, it's an irreversible one. These are my thoughts for reference.
