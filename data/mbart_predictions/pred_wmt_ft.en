Zhejiang University Academic Annual Meeting Students Sing Leading Song Research Results Open the Mind - chinanews.com
Wash hands with air, determine diseases with breathing air, accurately search for fog and haze sources Yesterday evening, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University's 2016 academic year, a series of brain-opening academic achievements were commended.
The main researchers of these results are students. The research covers various fields such as environment, mechanics, energy, medical, life sciences, and humanities education. Students started from a curiosity point and created many high-end inventions with application value, some of which have won international awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Family Physician
Dr. Zhang Deming, a Ph.D. student at Biomedical Engineering College, demonstrated a biosensor at the end of a smartphone that is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You only need to take a slight breath, and the instrument can test your health from the gas you breathe."
Zhang Deming explained that the sensors are connected to smartphones, and the health report is displayed on the phone after the gas is exhaled.
In the market, intelligent ring can detect the health condition, usually the physical parameters such as temperature, pulse, etc. are detected.
This biosensor uses the new material of graphene, the target of which is chemical elements, the sensitive "smell" allows it to reflect the health condition more deeply and accurately.
Smart Surgery Lamp: Doctors' High-Energy Eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in the operating room.
The invention won a silver prize at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Lin Yasheng and Shan Shun Fei, master students of the Institute of Optical and Electrical Sciences and Engineering, opened a new way of thinking in the defects of traditional surgical lamps and invented an intelligent LED surgical shadowless lamp.
"Many diseases can't be detected and removed early and are related to the lights used by doctors in the operating room."
For example, if doctors can't see all the tumor tissues in time when cancer is being checked early, then the cancer cells will continue to spread, Chen said.
This smart surgical lamp has four lamp discs, and by adjusting the spectra, it enhances the difference between different tissues under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectra, color uniformity and shadowlessness of spots at any time according to the operation needs and personal habits.
This smart operating lamp has already been tested in Zhejiang University Medical School's Shao Ying Hospital, Zhejiang University Medical School's Children's Hospital and other hospitals, and received better feedback.
Last October, the invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: water saving is cool
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, rub a lot of soap over the top, and squeeze a lot of hand wash liquid, while students such as Li Qianchao invented a set of "air hand wash devices."
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air out.
"It's like a gas cylinder.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the water tap and combines with the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
Colorization and bacterial residue experiments have shown that the washing effect of this method is the same as that of ordinary washing methods.
This device only depends on our own gravity as driver, can guarantee the level of cleaning and save 90% water, the whole process is completely energy-efficient, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Summit on Major Challenges, the invention excelled among many of the world's top universities and won the only gold award.

Okay, I'm in trouble.
A certificate that I think is meaningful - an emergency certificate
This is one of the skills certificates I think important besides driving licence!
Let's spread the word: emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of a sudden incident, i.e. before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that there is still some time when the ambulance arrives after the accident, and it is this time that is the most critical.
This is a time of urgency.
If I really had a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, and a sudden cardiac arrest, then the window of our life would only be four minutes, golden four minutes!
So the people around you know how important emergency is!
When someone falls by our side, we can rescue them with professional knowledge, rather than stand there and do nothing, and the sense of helplessness is terrifying.
"In China, we have official data that three million people die accidentally every year, the most dangerous of which is a heart attack.
In the U.S., an average of 15 percent can be saved.
Seventy-eight per cent of casino hotels in Las Vegas can be rescued, compared to less than one per cent in Shanghai and Beijing.
This is what the first reaction founder Lu Lu said.
If a person has a heart attack, no breathing, no heartbeat, you don't have any effect on the person.
It is necessary to breathe artificially and press on the outside of the chest to be able to rescue the person.
I find that very few of us now have this consciousness to learn emergency medicine, but when things happen, it's not enough, so I appeal to all of us to learn this skill, so that we can react in time to a sudden situation.
I'm not sure I can save a person's life!
The emergency certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross Training Centre. I registered at the Red Cross Training Centre in Zhuhai. Students also have discounts.
PS: The last picture is of me recording my goals to be accomplished by the age of 25, adding the emergency card to my list of goals a few months ago, but it's done!
Then go to the examination of other wants to test the certificate, intend to test a dive certificate, before in the little red book see another dive emergency certificate, the examination of this certificate seems to have to have an emergency certificate to go to the examination, so in fact the emergency certificate is useful!
I ordered ##NUMBER#
One of the 13 yuan shrimp dumplings!
Never tried
Why don't you write #NAME# and understand?
One for 13 yuan?
Yesterday #PRS_ORG# leaked a dish, this time a shrimp dumpling for me!?
Because it's obvious that I saw the effect when I entered the code before
First of all, to conclude, I personally think that the four oceans is an all-round bad movie, in all senses of the word.
But if you're talking about whether or not there's a bright spot in the movie, it's not at least a good choice of music.
There are many different kinds of bad films, one that lets you sleep well in the cinema, another that lets you get upset afterwards, and four oceans is like a monkey on Mount Emei for the audience, and it can burn your anger in countless ways.
In insulting the audience, Han is really talented and talented.
The most painful thing about this film is that it seems to be a creation from a fictional novel, hard to name, and a lot of holes like the windcoat on little Marco.
Even after you've finished, you'll doubt if there's a director's implicit metaphor in it, but when you think about it carefully, you find that it's really a piece of shit.
First of all, let me say a few things that I find difficult to understand.
The man's place of residence should be on a small island to the south, with his grandmother for life.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snowfall, and the plot arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive a small bread truck to take her northeast to see the snow.
The old man sat in a bread truck looking at snow from the south to the northeast?
He and his father were very relieved about it.
Then the old man was gone.
How did his wife get a business license to open a hotel on a scrapped boat?
On the island flying car party small mixed why can gently loosen the mountain road to seal the road?
Then in the middle of the road the truck delivering the reinforcement stopped at the side of the road, and the truck driver could not find it all around.
The sense of the tool is too obvious.
Why would a small mixed and mixed flying car party that can't be summoned and is suspected of illegally flying why would it become a police assistant?
Faced with high interest loan why not call the police, the police in the movie also asked specially whether there are difficulties?
An adult who knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to open a hotel's door with a room card and then forcefully arrange not to find a hotel boss and sit outside the hotel's door to sleep for a night?
This uncanny plot fills the whole movie, because the plot is so far removed that it pains me when I remember it.
Besides the plot, what is worse is the film's plot, or rather the film has no plot at all, it's a disgusting twist.
At the beginning of the film you think he wants to make a comedy film, and more than 20 minutes later you guess it might be an encouraging film, and halfway through it you think it might be a plot about how to survive in a small town, and after finishing it you don't know exactly what you've seen, and it follows that you feel deeply about yourself
For most people, they're actually very familiar with the movie sets. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, you've got enthusiasm + comedy and then tell the audience how a talented bird goes one step ahead of success.
If you want to make a love movie, you have to be honest about the wrangling between a small town youth who likes to ride motorcycles and a maid and a maid's sister.
If you want to reflect reality, at least your plot can't be contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new motorcycle that Yin is playing has just been burned, and the character can still sing), you can't go open some brain holes that can't even be seen by Kennedy.
As for the lady obviously is not weak intelligence can perform in some aspects like a five-year-old child, I really don't know whether this is the reason for acting or the director's request.
Also, I don't know why Han is so passionate about adding a crash scene to his own movie as a racer.
Isn't such a movie arranged in the Spring Festival event, is it to add to the crowd?

Chongqing junior high school pilot modern apprenticeship system: admission is an enterprise associate employee - Xinhua News Agency
Yesterday, the City Council of China was informed that starting this year, the city of China will conduct a pilot "modern apprenticeship system" training model in 60 secondary schools. Students who receive the pilot training will have apprenticeship status at the same time.
The City Council requested to standardize the admission and employment procedures for middle-level schools and enterprises, to clarify the dual status of students and associate employees of middle-level schools and enterprises, and to sign tripartite agreements between students, schools and enterprises in accordance with the principle of bidirectional selection, for students who do not reach the age of 18 when they reach the age of 16
The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system and jointly conduct pre-employment training and post-employment training with cooperative enterprises.
Pilot schools should reform talent training patterns.
The school and enterprise jointly design talent training programmes and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards and corresponding implementation programmes.
The pilot is a pilot cycle for the cultivation of the academic system. Students' internship time at the enterprise is determined according to the professional training programme, and the internship time at the top position is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice should implement enterprise group management model, according to different professional characteristics, one master can bring 2 to 5 apprentices to form learning group, to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotational position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, three batches of 60 city-level mid-level modern apprenticeship pilots were determined. Each pilot numbered around 50 people, with a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
In accordance with the principle of first pilot implementation and gradual progress from point to point, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of students by establishing joint admission, joint training and integrated upbringing of

South African Doctor: Omikjon has a strong transmission power but is mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the disease caused by the new crown virus Omikjon variant is lighter than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
More than 5,000 doctors and medical organizations in South Africa's Hoden province reported that they are treating new coronary patients with mild symptoms, such as physical pain and cough, similar to flu, as the disease spreads in South Africa, according to U.S. news agency Reuters.
Dr. Unben Pillay, director of the organization, said he saw dozens of patients every day, but there were no patients needed to be hospitalized.
"They are able to control disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of being isolated," said Pierre.
He said this included elderly people and those with health problems, who were more likely to become seriously infected with the coronary virus.
In contrast, he said, in the previous wave of Delta outbreaks, he treated new coronary patients with "difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels.
Many people will be hospitalized in a few days."
In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
Although it would take several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provided some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, only 30% of new coronary patients hospitalized in recent weeks were seriously ill, half of the proportion of the previous wave of epidemic seriousness; the average hospitalization time was reduced from 8 to 2.8 days; of recent new coronary patients, only 3% died in early South Africa
William Hanekom, director of the African Institute of Health, cited data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports: “At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease.”
He also said, "It's early now, and we need to get the late data.
Normally, hospitalization and death occur late, and we only enter the epidemic in two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Derta is still the world's leading new crown virus strain, cases of Omikyon disease are occurring in dozens of countries, South Africa being the centre of the epidemic.
According to health officials, the number of new cases found in the first week of December in Hoden Province increased by 400 per cent, and tests showed that more than 90 per cent of cases of Omikjon mutations occurred.
Thanks to today's supporters, 80 boxes were all sent out!

Education Timeline: What is it to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public-interest advertising phrase "no sale kills" with "no sale kills", then, in a good environment without the need for "kidnapping," group-control group-control, mass-anti-kidnapping, make the acts of kidnapping and selling unprofitable, high-risk, high-cost, such crimes will not happen again and again.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for publishing information on the abduction and development of missing children.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish authoritative channels for publishing information about missing children and to find children abducted in time.
Listening to the app called "团圆", I felt warm.
The new technology means not only the name "literature", full of emotions, but also the use of information is appropriate, practical and effective.
The first objective of kidnapping law enforcement is to find the kidnapped children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
The second is the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be enumerated in many "big words."
But before the case of kidnapping is dismissed, priority should be given to the safety of the victims.
The matter can be delayed for a while and discussed carefully; but the matter of rescuing abducted children should not be regarded as such, for the purposes of urgent "rescue," such as "whether abducted children should be subject to the death penalty," the subjects of controversy and controversy are varied.
Based on the detection experience of such cases, traffickers are accustomed to moving away from the scene as soon as possible after receiving the money.
If the kidnapping operation delays more than one minute, the child may be a step further away from the parents, and the difficulty of the case detection increases by one point.
In this case, it is indeed a pragmatic move to bring out a platform such as the "round-the-clock" platform that will directly help to detect cases and find effective ways to retrieve children.
After all, “kidnapping” is a big task that requires the entire legal system to function properly.
Fighting crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfecting of legislation to judicial guarantees, and rigorous enforcement, do not need to follow the care of "care of the weak child".
Moreover, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to society, can also do better.
For example, in a common case, a family of three took a break at the train station, and the parents fell asleep and woke up to find the child gone.
You can't expect a two-year-old child to have enough self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should have at least a considerable sense of protection.
Both parents take turns to rest, or put the child under proper protection, is the minimum means of preventing child abduction.
On the other hand, from the police's point of view of combating the crime of kidnapping, the purchase of kidnapped children should also be concerned and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just a loop in a long chain.
According to our country's Criminal Law, the statutory penalty for the crime of kidnapping and selling children is five years' imprisonment; if the circumstances are particularly serious, it can lead to the death penalty and the confiscation of property.
The penalty points are high and the maximum penalty is heavy, and the crime of kidnapping and selling children clearly belongs to the more severe punishment under the great trend of "less punishment".
But so far there are still many cases of kidnapping every year.
It can be seen that some people are lagging behind in the concept of raising children and the legal awareness is weak.
The legal education of this part of the people should be followed in synchrony.
To effectively control the crime of abduction and trafficking, it is not possible to rely solely on official strict enforcement.
If the abduction "market" exists widely, the abductions are motivated by the interests of the abductors, constantly innovating abduction methods, forming a "fighting law" situation with law enforcement, the abduction action will surely fall into a low-efficiency muddle.
Therefore, removing the backward concept and spreading the common sense of law will also help to eradicate the crime of child abduction and abduction.
Yang Kodong delivered a speech at the 19th 6th Central Assembly of the Party and the Provincial Party Assembly
Draw Strength from the Party's Hundred Years' Struggle
On the morning of December 10, according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Committee of the People's Party of Hunan, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee of the People's Party of Hunan, and the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee of the People's Party of Hunan, Yang Kodong, made an interactive publicity speech at the Video Creating Garden in Ma Baranshan.

The International Olive Oil Association classifies olive oil into two main categories, virgin olive oil and refined olive oil, at five levels.
The first-pressed olive oil, or called natural olive oil, is the grease obtained directly from fresh olive fruit by mechanical cold-pressing, filtering and other processing after removing the foreign material.
According to the different acidity can be divided into three levels:
Extra Virgin: It is the highest quality and highest quality olive oil and is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a mild and pleasant plant fragrance, acidity not exceeding 1%.
Fine Virgin olive oil: slightly high in acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and fragrant.
Ordinary Virgin olive oil: tastes and flavours acceptable, acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after first-pressed olive oil refining with an acidity exceeding 3.3%, or becomes "second-pressed oil".
The refined olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Olive Oil: refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of the first-pressed olive oil to harmonize flavor and color, with a acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent pale gold yellow.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil: is an olive oil extracted from oil residues and refined by a solution.
The acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
You know, olives are like wine grapes, and olives from different regions and varieties of olives produce different standards of olive oil.
The best growth site for oil olives:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions for olive oil growth, such as temperature, sunlight, air humidity and rainfall.
Other areas, except along the Mediterranean coast, can only grow zero stars in habitats.
Main producing area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and so on. Similar climates exist in Argentina, Peru, South Africa, and so on.
Months of oil olive harvest:
Between March and June, which is the time when oil olive trees bloom and bear fruit, from July to October the fruit begins to develop and mature, the fruit passes from green to red, purple, and finally turns black.
November to February is the harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional components of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, i.e. oil and fatty acids, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most suitable oil for human nutrition found to date.
At the end of the democratic summit, Biden says the fire of freedom will never go out
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Barack Obama and attended by governments and civil society and private sector leaders from 110 countries around the world, wrapped up on Friday (December 10th).
In his closing remarks, Byrd said that the fire of freedom burns in the hearts of everyone in the world and that authoritarian regimes can never extinguish it.
He also said he plans to hold the second global “democracy summit” next year.
Representative of the Taiwanese Government, Administrative Commissioner Tang Feng, and Hong Kong Democratic Human Rights Activist Ron Chung, who is currently exiled from the UK, also spoke at the summit the next day.
"We know how hard the work is before us," said Byrd.
But we also know that we can meet the challenge, because I said earlier that, as this summit showed, the democratic world is everywhere.
Dictatorships can never extinguish the spark of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world and around the world.”
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
"As leaders of governments, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, more resist the power of deterrence and shocks of authoritarianism, and those who seek power nakedly before the public interest," he said.
The theme of the next day's "Democracy Summit" will be the defence of human rights, consolidation of democracy and the fight against authoritarianism, as well as the fight against digital authoritarianism and the affirmation of democratic values.
This day coincides with International Human Rights Day.
In his opening remarks on the day, UN Secretary-General José Guterres also said that democracy faces global challenges, particularly those posed by emerging digital technologies.
"Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and democratic resilience," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
It also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, homelandism, and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution.”
Hong Kong democracy human rights activist Chen Ro-Kong gave a pre-recorded video speech at the summit, reminding participants of the continuing concern for the human rights situation of Chinese minorities such as Hong Kong's Uyghurs and Tibetans.
"For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise, but has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable," he said.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must cooperate.
We must use all the resources we have to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority."
Roccong also appealed to the free world to unite against the threats of the Communist Party of China.
He said: "Maybe some of you are afraid to annoy the Chinese government, perhaps some of you do not want to lose the Chinese market, perhaps some of you do not realize the threat to our democratic values posed by the (CCP).
And that's why we failed.
That's why we have to change."
At the round table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values," the Taiwanese Executive Council's Administrative Committee member, Tang Feng, released the State Declaration via video, emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and power.
He also shared his experience of how to fight the new cholera epidemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
"At a time when Taiwan's democracy is flourishing, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism and played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights," he said.
During the epidemic, the authoritarian governments in various parts of the world rationalized violations of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy showed signs of decline.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to shut down the city to control the epidemic, and we don't have to go downhill to defeat fake information.”
The U.S. Treasury announced sanctions against 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, who have been found to be seriously violating human rights, as well as restrictions on investments by a Chinese company that has been found to be using surveillance technology to assist in violating human rights.

Hello, the mouthwater chicken from the restaurant is live
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I can't keep up, so I want to find a player for the same price first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then the normal situation of expensive is more friendly than the cheaper one.
Their strength is very low, the ball hits on the pad, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't overcome, the masters are hard to control.
The logic and the underlying words of their existence are-- tennis is so hard, knowing that you can't learn, knowing that you don't want to buy expensive stuff to fool you, knowing that you play twice, and you won't play again, so this beat is cheap, and you won't have any pain.
Wait until you can really tell the difference between good and bad, and tell me you've made progress, and when you come back to buy expensive stuff from me, I'll make twice as much money.
It is recommended to spend a similar price, buy a second-hand good one, choose Prince, or Dunlop, the two brands are not famous enough, so good bats are not selling for the price, new bats 500, 600 is good, second-hand bats 200, have a thousand yuan bats
It's very friendly to newcomers, but once you've gone through the newcomer stage, it's the chicken ribs, but most people, especially girls, can't go through the newcomer stage.

In fact, there is a lot of talk about the body fat girls dress suits.
Fat girls don't wear skirts that are too short or too long, the length is almost on their knees, and can cover the fat part of their thighs.
The short skirt will expose the fat on the legs.
Too long will make people feel short and fat.
If you wear out the top and bottom three sections, you look naturally taller, it is the upper body, skirt and stockings in different colors, it looks to produce a feeling of extension.
In fact, many deep colored dresses are the markings of the little fat girls (this is the author's deep experience), deep color is also a good way to cover your body fat, elegant black short dress is also the favorite of the little fat girls.
Put on deep colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you feel thinner.
If your thighs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular the better, the color doesn't get too bright.
Avoid getting the feeling of obesity when people pay attention to your legs and feet.
For a little fat girl, it's important to tell her how to dress well.
Little fat girls should never wear tight short skirts, and the coat should not be too short or stuck in the skirt, it will make people look uncomfortable, if the legs are rough, they should wear black long stockings or net stockings (the kind of thin ones, oh), choose soft printed flowers
Of course, the little fat girls are also elegant in short skirts.
Fat girls wear short skirts and should choose a coat that matches the color of the short skirt, so that your fat body will have a higher effect.
Short skirts with high heels, can make your legs look longer, this is the best in summer!
If you are a fatMM with thin legs, we recommend you to choose a gorgeous dress.
It not only covers your belly, but also shows your strengths.
A short skirt will be very thin, more suitable for fat girls, the coat should choose tighter, forming layer feeling will be more thin.
Simple single white T-shirt with short skirt, fat MM can also try.
Fat girls are also able to wear fashion.
As long as you can master how to dress well, the little fat girls will be the focus of attention.
After the change in clothing matching, in life also do more exercise, strive to get rid of the label of micro-fat girls early in the day.[4]

The girl donated to her sister as a arrow target: "I think it's better to think it's a skin injury " - wikipedia.org
A girl in Wuling Square, Hangzhou, stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on the board.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl donating 'arrow target' to her sister" broke the circle of friends.
The photo shows a girl standing in front of a wooden board slightly taller than a human, with the word "human meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" written on the board, indicating that street people can shoot with bow and arrow after paying.
The act sparked enthusiasm among netizens.
Last night, the spokesman for the Lower Town Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Xinhua News that the police confirmed that the girl did not make such an outrageous move to raise money for her sister, but the behavior is not worth promoting. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Defendant warns to donate arrow targets to girls on streets
A long-haired girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the word "one" in black ink with the word "human meat target, 10 yuan one arrow" in front of another wooden board with her bank account and WeChat
The picture caused controversy after it went online.
Some netizens believe that this act is a "begging behavior of the ball of the eye," and many netizens express sympathy for this.
"We found out about 10 a.m. around 10 a.m. when we patrolled the side of the square, and there were already a lot of people around."
In an interview with local media, the Tian Shui police station near the scene of the incident said that there were two girls in the stand, all about 20 years old, dressed in their youthful beauty.
Among them, the girl who made the "human meat target" has been crying, asking the pedestrian to play the game; another girl on the side shouting, saying that her friend's sister has leukemia, now urgently need surgery, please help everyone.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was donating to treat her sister's leukemia."
Last night, the head of publicity at the downtown branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told reporters in the Xinjiang News that the girl, named Ji Jia Li, donated money for her sister Jia Yang.
But as treatment still requires more than 300,000 dollars, it was not possible to find a good way to raise funds.
He said that during the whole process, two girls, one as a target, one responsible for hand-to-hand, but did not participate in it, the whole process did not find someone shooting arrows, just someone watching and taking photos on the microblogging.
The bow and arrow used by the police after the security department's assessment is not within the control category.
"It is not advisable to take this kind of eyeball donation method," the head of the department said.
After warning the police station people, she has left the police station.

What will be the hottest in 2021?
There is no doubt about the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win the prize?
In the previous paragraph, there was a article called "Look! Project Managers can hit gold medals in Olympic Projects" which was very hot, and it mentioned project managers in many projects, absolutely can be one horse first, no one can beat: moving bricks, business trips, staying up at night is the day-to-day of project managers, rescue fire, back boiler
An article that seems to be a joke, but also tells the daily bitterness of project managers, behind represents the power of current project management.
And the personnel engaged in project management, also gradually choose through some actions to get rid of the work difficulties.
According to the increasing number of PMP (International Certificated Project Management Professional Qualification) registrations each year, more and more project management practitioners improve their project management abilities through learning.
According to the China Project Management Twenty-Year Development Report (1999-2019): As of September 2019, the total number of PMP® registrations in China is nearly 6 million, the number of PMP® certifications is about 420,000, the number of valid certificates is about 300,000, which is the total number of PMP® certificates in the world
Over the past decade, the number of PMP holders has grown year by year, indicating that more and more project managers are aware that it is impossible to do things simply by relying on the old experience, and that the changing work environment lets us know the way forward by standing on the shoulders of a science giant.
However, can the examination of PMP ensure the smooth management of the project without obstruction?
Many beginners in project management say that by learning related courses such as PMP/IPMP, they can systematically master the ten areas of project management and the five process groups, etc. related knowledge points, but when really conducting project management, it is still a mess.
Many project managers often give feedback on the following problems: project management is not well-known, it depends solely on personal experience, there is no project management theory, and there is no way to practice it; lack of system support for project management process system, it is not possible to land at work, project estimation is incorrect, control sensitivity is poor, project is dragged on and on
Thus, focusing on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to train a large number of R&D key talents such as product managers and project managers, and has received the honorary title of "China's R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base" and so on
R&D Project Managers Training Course This is a decoupled online learning method that combines real-world cases, tools and methods of many R&D-type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers and take the path of project management on your own.
This is also a time to allow enterprises to use lower cost and less input, promote the process of project manager training, and bring the opportunity for enterprises to bring efficient operation results.
This course is not only conducted by the China Tian Hua Xia Expert Team (former Huawei R&D Management Team), combined with the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises, to give a thorough and thorough professional explanation of the course content.
Moreover, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, rich template forms, and help students to translate the contents of their studies into concrete work after class.

Vietnam People's Daily News - Gulf Cooperation Commission responds to common challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Amman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain, and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a embargo on Qatar in mid-2017, leading to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf.
During the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations and of close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tension seriously affected the internal unity of the Commonwealth and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked land and sea routes to Qatar.
The crisis was resolved only at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January 2021, when the Gulf states signed an agreement to move toward “solidarity and stability” through mediation between the United States and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in restoring relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
The Gulf Arab States resolved their differences in order to restore relations with Qatar based on the need to unite in the interests of the nations and regional stability and to respond to common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Amman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbours.
The 725 km long corridor connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for both citizens to travel and integrate the supply chain.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $50 billion in Amman, and the two countries signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $300 billion.
His visit to the Gulf states coincided with negotiations between Iran and the world’s major powers on the rescue of the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan (JCPOA) on Iran’s nuclear deal – an agreement condemned by a Gulf Arab country for failing to resolve the Iranian missile problem.
The Gulf states have long regarded Iran as a long-term “competitor” and Iran’s nuclear program as a “threat” to regional security.
The Gulf States considered that there was a flaw in not solving the Iranian missile problem and taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region.
Saudi Arabia has conducted direct negotiations with Iran against the background that the nuclear negotiations with the major countries have failed to satisfy the aspirations of the Gulf States.
Its aim is to curb the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that slows down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Commission.
The upcoming summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States will be the first summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States since the end of the dispute between some member states and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Committee to reassess the diplomatic achievements that it has contributed to promoting the restoration of the unity of the Commonwealth of Independent States of the Gulf, as well as to propose measures to enable its member states to cooperate fully to respond to common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Call the new mountain area ultra-run exhaust the loudest!
This time our team brought this car to everyone, is the dream of many men!
It's Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of horses is nearly two million, road tax horses are tens of thousands a year, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast you can be because you have 700 horsepower?
The data says that 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds, probably it's the official's myvi to get to 30km/h when people get to 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, the exuberant shear doors, the huge vents that surround the body and the glass next to the endless 6.5 v12 engines perfectly illustrate Lamborghini's style.
The description of the car doesn't need to say too much, if you Google it yourself, please organize some explanations that Google doesn't necessarily give!
Too much attention, wherever everyone is looking, very uncomfortable (actually a bit refreshing)
1km oil money is around RM1 (the driver doesn't care at all)
Exercise up and down, or it'll be a little embarrassing (because you can't climb the cabin and hold half of it)
The engine is too loud and you'll be deaf when you get off the car.(But it's still cool)
The car is too big to be parked in a normal parking lot. It's too narrow to be knocked on when the next door car opens!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (the head of state himself said, it's not about the driver, ha ha)
Don't get me wrong, this video's super runs are not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your favorite car, please contact us!
More information about cars you don't know is available in The Car Guide / People's Cars
Tow to a car accident worth tens of millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 believe that car friends all know, Chiron is one of the world's most expensive super racing, and Porsche 911 car price is also a million class!
The day before, overseas in just a few minutes crashed a million car 911 and a million overruns Chiron!
Look at the result, it makes sense!
Let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times - Xinhua News Agency
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of schooling ideas and value pursuits which accumulated in the course of development over a long period of time, and is the soul of the university.
From ancient times to the present, university spirit is vital to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, the university has a unique mission unlike other social organizations. For our university, it emerged in the autumn of national crisis, and its spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times, advocating the "Ming Dynasty, Shu Qi Jiping"
At present, the trend of higher education informationization and internationalization is becoming increasingly evident, and the global educational competition, technological competition, talent competition is increasingly intensifying. As an important "supply side," the higher education enterprise is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reform.
In particular, the proposal of the "General Programme of Coordination to Promote the Construction of World-Class Universities and Primary Subjects" demonstrates the confidence and determination of our country to move from a higher education nation to a higher education nation, and also puts forward more up-to-date requirements for university development.
How can we try to enter the world's top ranks in a shorter time and accelerate the construction of some world's top universities and a number of world's top disciplines on the basis of still some gaps to achieve the "bending supercar"?
In addition to firm goal self-confidence, path self-confidence, and ability self-confidence, universities should take full advantage of three advantages: one, the post-graduate advantage, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents abroad, learning from the advanced experience of world-leading universities, and achieving a significant improvement in the academic level and the quality of running schools; and two, the cultural advantage, inheriting the Chinese civilization in five millennia
It is especially important to realize that it is impossible to build world-class universities on one side and each school must show its individuality and characteristics while exercising its superiority.
The characteristics of running schools should be shared with the Chinese characteristics, but they should also reflect their own unique goals, schooling traditions and resources.
With respect to Zhejiang University, we focus on highlighting three aspects of our schooling: firstly, highlighting the characteristics of innovative entrepreneurship and talent training, building the integrated environment of faculty and university and enterprise integration, and forming the ecosystem of entrepreneurship education in a whole chain; secondly, highlighting the characteristics of cross-disciplinary gathering, promoting the optimum adjustment of the discipline system, and creating
In this process, it is especially important to maintain the university spirit at all times and to allow the university spirit and the spirit of the times to coexist with each other.
For Zhejiang University, the newest chart of Zhejiang University's spirit consists of the joint values of "Create innovation," "Work hard, study ethics, be clear, be faithful," and "Hina River, Enlightenment and good faith, pre-existing people, trees and my country"
This is an important guarantee of maintaining the correct direction of running the school and continuously accumulating cultural height and cohesive spiritual strength, rich in connotation and far-reaching in meaning.
Among them, "Hina River" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodied in the heart of "the world's wisdom for me," embodied in the quality philosophy of drawing up the world's leading schools to educate people; "Enlightenment and generosity" emphasizes the spirit of sincerity and goodness, meaning
This series of spiritual ideas and values pursuit is the soul of Zhejiang University's 120-year running.
"He who is wise hears in silence, and he who is wise sees in intangible."
When China's higher education institutions further build on the overall cause of Chinese characteristics and socialism, deeply grasp the historical mission of the era and responsibilities of the higher education cause, and accelerate the construction to become the world's first-class university.
At the same time, maintaining the humanist concern and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times and the national spirit stir each other up, thus providing inexhaustible impetus for the realization of the country's prosperity and national revival and realization of the common ideal of mankind.

As the NFT exploded, the encryption community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called "Axie Infinity" had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, with residents losing their jobs due to the epidemic beginning to earn stable incomes from the game.
Axie Infinity is a bottom-up pet-growing game based on blockchain technology, with multiple gameplays including NFT. It is currently the highest-denominated NFT project, with more than $30 billion so far.
According to TokenTerminal, Axie Infinity earned more than $82 million a day, directly pushing King's Glory.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially said that its daily users had exceeded one million.
The fireworks of Axie Infinity are passing on a new "palytoearn" model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, the player is no longer a single player, but can participate in the game's eco-government, besides enjoying the game's fun and economic benefits.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game creators, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Looking at the news about the share price of friends, my most touching feeling is the choice of enterprises in the race, i.e. the choice of industries that point to investment marks, first of all, the choice of industries with a large growth space, at least a market size of more than 10 billion; secondly, the choice of industries with good growth potential in the future, considering the growth potential achieved in the next 3-5 years
How wide is the market size, how long is the stage of development of the industry, how flat or rough is the competition pattern of the industry.
For the right racecourse!
In the new year, the first thing is to summarize the 2021 adjustment 2022 tactical layout.
The tactic is to do the things right.
The strategy is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, tactics is about landing, and above most tactical thinking, there is space for strategic thinking.
For example, how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking) can be thought of either continuously deepening the current field or extending the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, how to increase the customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be thought of how to increase the retention rate of core customers and high value customers (strategic thinking); in raising activities
Bitcoin, which was born 12 years ago, will be celebrating several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin a legal currency, the first time Bitcoin has become a legal currency in a country or region.
On October 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC) approved ProShares' introduction of the Bitcoin futures ETF for the first time in eight years, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the first jointly regulated Bitcoin futures ETF to enter the U.S. capital market, and the opening for cryptocurrencies investments to be expanded again.
From the point of view of blockchain technology development, Bitcoin is not the main player.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin undertook a soft fork upgrade called "Taproot", which improved the anonymity of Bitcoin network transactions and reduced the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American group complains about discrimination in admission to Yale and other three Changchun Fuji name schools - china.com
More than 130 ethnic groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and Justice on May 23, protesting the discrimination against students applying for admission at three prestigious universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College
The Asian Education League, which has raised the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The group's chairman, Zhao Yuquan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria for American universities has doubled over the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian applicants at these three American universities remains essentially at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have "long-term sustainability and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" during the so-called "composite consideration" process of admission.
According to Zhao Yuqiang, research by scholars such as Sands in 2014 showed that Asians had the lowest enrollment rate among all ethnic groups in the three universities.
The data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Chung Chun Fuji Alliance schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yu told Xinhua news agency that they expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate the complaint and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians when enrolling.
They also expect the complained universities to take this issue seriously and change their admission policies for Asians.
At present, the three colleges complained about have not yet responded.
The Association for Asian Education was founded in 2015 when it complained of discrimination in admission to Harvard University, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American groups involved in the complaint, there are also educational groups of Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani descent in the United States.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned from a housing intermediary about a factory in Zhejiang Yu Yao Jiao Ting Town, and after seeing the factory several times on the spot, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase of the factory building with the family of the owner of the house, Mr. Lin, and made a deposit of 20,000 yuan through the bank transfer on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the Receiver of the Settlement Clause on the Sale and Purchase of Factory House, which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory house, the settlement will be returned to the seller, if the seller does not want to sell this factory house, the settlement will be doubled back to the seller, both sides
However, the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale of factory premises and payment method, failed to form a consensus, resulting in the delay in signing the contract for housing purchase and sale.
Considering the failure of the two sides to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned Mr. Lu's $20,000 deposit.
It was not easy to see the house, the deposit was paid, the rent was ready, and the contract was signed "on the doorstep", but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu unable and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu brought a case against Mr. Lin to the People's Court of Yu Yao City.
The court considered that the parties ultimately failed to sign the formal contract and could not be blamed solely on the defendant, which should reasonably be deemed to be unsuccessful in consultation. Therefore, the fine should not apply in this case, and the defendant did not have to bear double the default liability for the refund of the fine.
After the judgment at first instance, the plaintiff brought an appeal.
Recently, the Court of Second Instance maintained the original ruling.
[Counsel reminds] In the course of the transaction to do the necessary cautionary duty.
At the same time as signing the contract, the buyer should do all necessary careful attention obligations, for example, verify the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, etc., and make clear in the contract about the specific time and place of delivery, in order to prevent conflicts between the parties in performing the contract at the same time.
(The Voice of Germany) At the end of Friday's "Democracy Summit," China's foreign ministry spokesman said on Saturday (December 11) that the "Democracy Summit of Leaders" was organized by the U.S. in the name of "the ideological division of democracy into tools, weapons and counter-democracy
The Chinese government believes, "For a long time, the United States has imposed its own political system and values on people, implemented 'democratic reforms', abused unilateral sanctions, and launched a 'color revolution', with disastrous consequences.
'Democracy' has long been the weapon of mass destruction in which the United States intervenes in other countries.
The summit was a step in the right direction for Biden to honour his campaign commitments.
The two-day video conference was attended by leaders from 111 countries around the world, including Taiwan, but China and Russia were not invited.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States on the issue of its own democracy, saying that the United States was not eligible to host such a summit.
There are voices of doubt both internationally and within the United States, such as criticism of the leaders invited to the summit, including some of the most authoritarian leaders, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who doubt that the Biden government's real intention was to organize the summit for geopolitical purposes rather than for democracy.
The newly appointed German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also attended the video democracy summit
China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday, "Today's American democracy is manifestly ill, with money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, ethnic contradictions, and the division of the rich and poor," and that American democracy is based on capital.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the fence of democracy, push for reforms, achieve transparent accountability governance, more resist the power of deterrence and shock from dictatorships, and those who want to stay ahead of public interests," President Bill Clinton said in a statement
He stressed that democracy was not taken for granted. "We must keep updating it in every generation, and in my view this is the decisive challenge of our time."
He also said that global democracy and human rights "need fighters to defend democracy in the face of persistent and worrying challenges."
The United States pledged to launch a one-year action after the summit, including an initiative worth $4.244 billion to strengthen democracy around the world and provide support to independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make concrete public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the entity democracy summit scheduled for the end of 2022.
"Let all countries implement our commitments and report on the progress we have made next year," said Byrd.

Educational Thinking: How University Examinations Make "Teachers" and "Teachers' Squabbles" Everywhere - chinanews.com
Three students from Lanzhou University of Transportation wrote letters to the faculty leadership, reflecting the confusion about the university examination, and proposed to increase the difficulty of the examination, change the examination subject type, and make the examination really reflect the student's actual level of appeal.
Indeed, university examinations have long been a “hot topic.”
In the university campus, students come from five lakes and four seas, with different levels of ability, plus different degrees of learning, and different conditions of learning.
Different feelings are inevitably present when evaluating groups with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the examination question type is single, the repetition rate is high, the question is too simple, it will inevitably cause another completely different feeling.
Students who don't do well may be able to do well by concentrating on the attack before the exam, and if you think of other ways, it is possible to achieve a half-work-double effect.
In this way, the "study residue" that does not enter normally can pass the test, or even get high marks; the "study supervisor" normally never drops classes, the homework, notes are good, and the examination does not raise much of the "strange status quo."
In this way, the students of Lanzhou University reflect the problems that exist in university examinations is not without reason, believe that this situation is not only in Lanzhou University.
From this point of view, the three students who wrote the letter are to be commended.
In fact, everyone who has been to university is aware of the phenomenon of trying to get "focused counseling" before exams, trying to draw up the examination scope, and trying to get "focused counseling" from the teacher. In fact, many people have seen the phenomenon of getting "focused counseling" before exams, and even taking small copies during exams, and asking the teacher to raise them after exams
In the author's view, as a guide for evaluating the quality of teaching, the measurement of whether a university exam is passed or not depends more on teachers' comprehensive understanding of teaching and learning, and on the basis of scientific propositions.
In the undergraduate stage of university, the specialty begins to be divided, and many specialty courses are based on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether mastering the basic knowledge of a discipline in full is the content of university examination.
And undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theory and basic common sense of the discipline. From the point of view of knowledge, the space of change is not large, but it is basically fixed.
As one teacher said, “I learned the basics of mathematics at university 20 years ago, and now I am still learning, and that’s the point.”
But the knowledge point is essentially unchanged, does not represent the test question type single, test question repetition.
In many universities, the examination usually consists of a group of subjects, and then the examination papers are composed by senior teachers in the discipline, and the examination papers are also participated by all teachers in the department, so that the repetition of the subjects can be overcome to some extent.
However, in order to develop a set of test questions that are in line with teaching and learning practice, the subjects are difficult to distribute in equilibrium according to the overall situation of students' learning. It is also necessary to master the teaching situation in equilibrium and analyze the degree of students' learning in equilibrium. Thus, the test subjects are dynamically grasped by the difficulty and type of subjects, and can highlight basic knowledge
The examination is the commanding rod of university education. What kind of examination, students will have corresponding preparatory programmes, which will affect the effectiveness of university education in the long term.
With regard to the students' letter of recommendation, Lanzhou gave high priority to the university side and has deployed the correction program in the entire school.
The teaching units are requested to organize teachers to conduct peer review and peer review of course completion examinations, formulate testimony statements and related systems, strengthen supervision and inspection of testimony statements and examination stages, refine performance assessment, and strengthen comprehensive assessment of course teaching stages.
The problem of solving the problems of single type of test questions and repetition of questions from the mechanism is the subject that university examination needs to face. Of course, the corresponding system needs to be put in place, but Kung Fu is expensive in everyday life, the teacher needs to have full knowledge of the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the student learning situation, both heads eat

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah with no life-saving paper specially made for counterfeit paper fractures
(Api 11) The Saba National Registration Bureau said that since the beginning of October, it has been impossible to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the use of light from specially designed anti-counterfeiting paper warehouses. Up to now, 3,200 people have been affected.
However, the bureau's director, Carol Aminus, assured that all babies who had applied for the paper had been recorded in the system and would be re-issued when the counterfeit paper was shipped next week.
At a press conference, he explained the 10-month-long reporting of a network media outlet pointing to the paper printing problem in Sabah newspapers.
He said that the problem had arisen two months ago, and that the same problem was being faced in Sarawak.
"One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing special anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delays in deliveries to China."
He explained that the use of counterfeit paper in Saba newspapers was different from that in other regions and that it was not possible to borrow inventories from other states.
The latest batch of counterfeit paper was shipped to Kuala Lumpur on 6th of this month and then handed over to the printing company for printing on 8th of this month, Keru Aminus said.
"The Bureau will dispatch people to Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to pick up the goods and return to Sabah immediately for the final phase of printing. It is estimated that more than two working days (December 20) will be available to the applicants."
"We will notify applicants to go to the branch offices to collect the paper."
He added that Saba has issued a total of 24801 newspapers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock till now
Isn't that coming soon?
I mean food
I'm back in front of #PRS_ORG#
Well, thank you, because the restaurant says it's ready

48 Hour Nuclear Acid Negative, Establish "Buffer Zone" State Council's Joint Mechanism for Joint Defense and Control Calls for Strengthening of Port City Epidemic Prevention and Control - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency (China Xinhua News Agency) on Sunday (December 11, China Xinhua News Agency) issued a notice on the joint control mechanism of the State Council on the strengthening of the control of new cases of pneumonia in port cities, calling for the immediate removal of personnel from land border port cities (except those connected with ports in Hong Kong and Macau)
According to the notice, the time limit for the above request is 15 March 2022, from the date when the port city scope was determined and announced by the provincial and district municipalities.
In addition, the notification also suggests that conditional port cities may study the establishment of quarantine control buffer zones within the jurisdiction.
The head of the disease prevention and control bureau of the National Health and Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and the people of both sides visit frequently.
By implementing the differentiated management policy in the subdivisions, from one out-of-control out-of-surplus line to two out-of-control lines, it is hoped to achieve the front-pass, compress out-of-surplus risks of epidemics, achieve the maximum effect of out-of-control of epidemics with minimal social impact and minimum social cost.
In recent years, many local agglomerated epidemics have occurred in China, all of which have been imported through port cities outside China.
The above-mentioned notification points out that this exposes some issues such as inadequate early warning of local epidemic monitoring, failure to implement closed-loop management of high-risk positions, periodic flow of nucleic acid testing, inability to eliminate cold chain items at all stages, inadequate management of centrally isolated sites, and inadequate scientific accuracy in emergency management of epidemic situations.
The notification request focuses on nine aspects, including improving the control mechanism of urban quarantine at ports, improving the monitoring and early warning system of quarantine, implementing border control measures, speeding up the completion of the short-term weaknesses of urban quarantine at ports, not relaxing, scientifically accurately performing the control work, and tightening the seals to prevent external imports
The notification emphasizes that each port city should conduct simultaneous research and deployment of epidemic prevention and control as well as work to safeguard the lives of its citizens, publish and circulate hotlines for safeguarding the lives of its citizens, regularly investigate small-scale risks in the supply of basic living materials, prices, etc., and solve and respond promptly to the outstanding issues reflected by the public.
According to the notification, the port city referred to therein includes open land, water and air ports in the county (city, district, flag), city (county, state, union) and city directly under the jurisdiction of the provinces (autonomous regions, city directly under the jurisdiction of the union) according to the epidemic situation

Oil pipe video reveals the truth of 20 years of American bloodthirsty killing - chinanews.com
(Video Source: Oil Pipe)
On December 11, a micro documentary on the oil pipe platform called Killing Machine attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of the United States waging the war in Afghanistan under the name of "anti-terrorism," forcing the export of American democracy through the war, committing 20 years of armed robbery, blood lust, indiscriminate killing, and all kinds of crimes against humanity.
Abuse of UAVs in civilian areas such as hospitals, schools, etc. distorts human nature and creates a killing group.
For 20 years, the U.S. has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The U.S. military set up a "black prison" to impose torture and humiliation on "the suspects".
A pile of crimes against humanity stirs up hatred among more Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terrorist” war is “more and more anti-terrorist.”
The war did not bring peaceful democracy and hope of prosperity to the Afghan people, but only a devastated country and countless massacres.
Post the video, let's uncover the truth of America's bloody slaughter in the name of "anti-terrorism" and post the fake face of American democracy!
Inadvertently see the following article, from a commercial point of view and from the point of view of the preservation period, about why the customer wants the logistics company in the tax area to help make the canning, although the canning belongs to the deep processing, not to the operational scope of the tax logistics company, here the following text may explain why the customer wants to do so
I went to many milk powder manufacturers and contacted many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the bags are the same as the milk powder, and their raw materials are the same, no difference whatsoever.
Then everyone will surely ask: Why is the warranty period of the bag one year, while the warranty period of the listening bag is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between listening and baggage so big?
In fact, from this point of view, many consumers, or mother-level think it is because the raw materials are different so the quality will be much better.
In fact, raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers who respond after eating from this mentality and say that the taste or taste of listening is different!
Now let me tell you the reason why it sounds expensive. Where is it?
Why are their raw materials the same and the differences so great?
Because most manufacturers when fixing prices consider that if the price of bags is too high, the consumer is hard to accept, which means that the profits generated by the manufacturer are very low, or no profits, what does the manufacturer depend on to survive?
So they have a huge rise in the price of their hearing aids to secure their profit margin.
So most manufacturers are pushing for hearing suits instead of bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even billions of dollars on advertising every year, what's the cost?
You can all think about it.
So, with the development of society, the marketing expenses of the market, for example: promotion staff, display expenses of the market, gift expenses of the products, advertising expenses, etc. are constantly increasing.
So every manufacturer is constantly adding new ones, and it is listening, its price is also constantly rising, in fact it is new with the increase of market cost.
The main purpose is to get higher profits, in fact their raw materials increase the cost at most won't exceed three or four dollars.
There is also a part of the brand, in order to promote their own products, choose the means, linked with hospital doctors, assisted by them in promoting the products, from one listen to get 30 yuan to 80 yuan in various profits.
And China's relevant laws are absolutely not permitting such methods of operation, in fact, the practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that everyone should buy packed milk powder in a can at home, so that it can save money, and increase the preservation and sealability of milk powder, and does not have any effect on children.
Also, don't think that the warranty period of listening bag is longer than the bag, if the warranty period of listening bag is the same after opening the bag, just say that the bag is not easy to store after opening the bag, it is easy to get wet.
The meal was late, and the food was cold, cold and hard, and there was no way to eat it

Don't frighten people on the runway - Xinhua News Agency
When you go to the bookstore, you can often feel the explosion of successful school books.
Many of today’s successful textbooks advocate the “best principle” – i.e., first assume or imply that you can “do it” and then tell you “what” you need to do.
It's a matter of saying "how to do it" at once, the most important and fundamental link.
That's why these books have one thing in common: either you work as hard as you can, or you just don't do anything; either it's 100, or it's 0; or you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle," which everyone sees admits is "unbelievably right," but 99% of people are scared to the runway.
Because this theory promotes the path of "you have to make a strong determination to be human again, to come to a 180-degree transformation," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
To those who follow the customs, obey the old, and refuse to change, you must shout at his ears, "You must change," and it is surely a self-deceiving act, a deceiving act, and a deceiving act on the bull's violin.
The vast majority of people will be frightened before the two words "transformation," wrapped up in their feet, difficult to make a decision; or by the impulse of a moment pained the determination of "transformation," and bravely took the first step, but often the good scene is not long, persisting for a short while and failing
Mr. Martin's famous "From Tomorrow to Tomorrow" is the classic that best expresses this universal humanity.
The biggest problem with the “best principle” is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people’s ability, making most people “shout at the door.”
Perhaps the “second best principle” is the way to get more ordinary people on a relatively successful path.
The core of the second best principle lies in lowering the threshold, which encourages a theory of accumulating small wins for big wins, i.e. if you can't do 100, you can only do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mt. Tai, you can only climb the small sand dunes at your doorstep
Anyway, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing it.
Because the threshold is significantly lowered, there is a lot of possibility that ordinary people can stick to it, and the probability of success increases as long as everything sticks to it.
It's just a little bit longer to follow the success path of the "second best principle."
Overall, the “best principle,” despite its apparent flagship of success for all, can ultimately motivate, in fact, a minority; and the “second best principle,” can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake Nut Leather Resources Increase This Year by 0.71 million tons - chinanews.com
Xinhua Xining News Agency ( Xinhua Xining News Agency) reported on Monday (December 11) that the Qinghai Agricultural Rural Office reported on the latest monitoring results showing that the stock of carp in Qinghai Lake had increased by 0.71 million tonnes this year to 10.85 million tonnes compared to the initial period of protection in 2002
The popular name of the naked carp of Qinghai Lake, "Huangfish," is a unique precious fish species in Qinghai Lake, and plays a significant role in the safety and biodiversity of the ecological chain "water-fish-bird" of the Qinghai Lake basin.
During the sixties and seventies of the 20th century, the number of carnivorous carnivores in Qinghai Lake was drastically reduced due to factors such as large-scale hunting and the increasing degradation of the environment in the breeding waters of carnivorous carnivores. In 2002, the stock of carnivorous carnivores in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Red List of Chinese Species listed the nudibranch of Lake Qinghai as a threatened species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a sealed lake fishery, which prohibits any unit, collective or individual from fishing naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and Lake District, and prohibits the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, by means of artificial breeding and discharge as well as cleaning up the main channels of the Qinghai Lake, designing scientifically reasonable "overfishing channels" and other measures, the conservation effort has been steadily increased, and the stocks of carnivorous carnivorous resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.
Yang Lin, deputy head of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office in Qinghai province, said that up to now, the artificial breeding and discharge of nearly 1.8 billion tails of Qinghai Lake carp had been carried out, and the contribution rate to the recovery of the carp resources in Qinghai Lake was more than 23%.
Qinghai Three River source area is an important ecological barrier and water source conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area controlling western desertification spread to the east.
In order to protect the ecological ecology of the Three Rivers source area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife and preserve the biological diversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a Notice of Prohibition of Fishing in Key Water Areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and Qinghai Lake since this year, and has built up a comprehensive "one river, one river, one lake"

It's been an hour and it hasn't been delivered yet
It's too long to see an article that's an example.
Give unknown men a copy.
Most girls will suddenly experience their first regular leave one day between the ages of 13-15, and close it at around age 50.
Afterwards, on the condition of good health, we will come regularly every month.
But it's also not regular to be able to accurately predict, about a week or so difference, need to prepare in advance, sometimes bad luck will turn the car (suddenly several days ahead of schedule).
The length of time, the amount of blood, the degree of pain varies from person to person, some three days, some one week; some few flows, some big blood collapse; some have no reaction, some have pain to the ambulance ride, pain will change with time, before pain does not mean lifelong pain.
The menstrual cycle cannot be controlled, and blood flows 24 hours a day from the beginning to the end of the days, and can only be done with a sanitary napkin or a sanitary cotton stripe to prevent blood from flowing to the clothes chair.
Painful menstruation is mainly due to the secretion of the prostate gland, the physiological period has not come to the beginning of painful menstruation when fast to eat thrombin can effectively relieve the pain during the month, painful menstruation starts after eating no use.
Before the period of physiology, it is easy to pull the abdomen due to excessive release of uterine blood and prostate glands.
If you're about to get your period, you'll get your menstrual period basically within two days.
It is best to replace the towel once every two or three hours, otherwise it will easily infect bacteria. Apart from sleeping time, the worst case is to replace it six times a day, seven days a month, that is, 42 pieces. If you add 50 pieces prepared in advance, it will not be used every month.
(Please change here, the sanitary cotton strips don't need to be changed all the time, it can be changed once for about 56 hours, for a maximum of eight hours)
Menstrual hormone poisoning may be more rabid, ovulation may also be caused by hormonal changes in the mood, which is very unfortunate, the body makes itself a stumbling block.
But official crime figures show that women's ability to control emotions is still high, and that they do not take emotions as an excuse.
The flow is not just blood, which includes the absorption of the uterine membrane.
The membrane of the uterus after menstruation is thinest, then slowly thickens, it can be understood that the uterus is a house, every month build a house (the membrane thickens) ready to welcome guests, the guests did not come, all dismantle (the uterus is removed) next month build a new house, week after week
Menstruation is uncomfortable, continuing for decades, every few days 24 hours blood flow, and also abdominal and lumbar pain, who wants?
But a person can be born because his mother comes through the menstruation, the menstruation is to prepare you to live in a house for 10 months when you first come to the world, everyone should thank their mothers regular health to come through the menstruation.
Many things about women were suppressed in the past, society told women to wash their minds, it was dirty, it was shameful, everyone thought it was that way, but the times have changed.
If someone feels bad about menstruation, feels bad about the preparations made by women's bodies for their pregnancy and life, it should not be said in the public gallery, girls stand up, don't think so again, never experienced, never experienced, never understood men, don't forget
Finally, sisters, try out the sanitary cotton strip, it's really good.
It's winter to holiday today, and it's disappointing to make mistakes
To order another meal for the children
I hope you'll check it out in the busy shop.
Is the foot bath bubble foot scarf leaked electricity?
Choosing the right foot bath basin can play a good foot therapy health role, today the state official will answer the question, hoping to help friends.
With the increase of people's health awareness, bathtubs have become more and more popular with consumers, and a large number of different products have appeared in the market, ranging from hundreds of thousands to thousands of dollars, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On the surface of the relevant data, compared with traditional household electricity, the sale of household electricity such as bathtubs and bathtubs has exploded, but bathtubs and bathtubs do not have special industry standards, so there are certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to bump your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Li told reporters recently that he bought a bathtub for his father for his birthday present, but his father felt the soles of his feet when bubbling.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath basin, did not expect to turn off the vibration function, but the father still feels the bottom of the foot.
Mr. Li tried the pen, and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the bathtub had electricity.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was good. Mr. Li was still uncomfortable despite withdrawing from the bathtub.
Because he found that this long-established foot bathtub now has no clear detailed industry regulations on the setting of the highest temperature, what kind of people, what kind of materials guarantee harmlessness and so on.
But in general the foot bath basin will not have the problem with electricity, but also exclude a few products from the factory when there is no strict control.
Therefore, choose a separate bathtub when purchasing.
Water and electric separation, there is no safety danger.
At the same time, you can take a pencil test at will.

Tinko Lin: To my friends.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all my friends for the humanitarian relief they have provided during the long period of 30 years since our relatives were killed, especially the humanitarian relief that has not been interrupted so far since I made a personal appeal to friends at home and abroad at the beginning of 1994.
Nowadays, the majority of the victims' old parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up into domestic employment.
Your acts of kindness have helped our troubled families through the most difficult times.
The new cholera epidemic is now sweeping the globe and most of the donors have retired over the years.
Therefore, I implore you to suspend the humanitarian contributions of the Tiananmen Mothers' Group, which should have been the perfect slogan for the humanitarian relief effort.
I will remember your love forever, and I firmly believe that your righteous acts will be remembered for history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive my friends!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
May I take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the philanthropic relief efforts of IFCSS and the MNCDF.
In the process of carrying out humanitarian rescue, the All-American School of Self-Organization and the Minnesota China Democratic Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project implementers are often intertwined.
(Apple Daily Photo: Mother Tiananmen website handled by pottery.)pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
Rescue funds are often not delivered successfully to the hands of sixty-four refugees.
In 1994, Mr. Zhending suggested that a special group be set up by the Mother of Tiananmen to coordinate and distribute rescue funds.
In 1998, the MCDF established the Sixty-Four orphan Education Fund, which was implemented 11 years later. In 2009, after graduating from all sixty-four orphan universities, the MCDF established the Sixty-Four orphan orphan orphan special helper fund, which has been implemented to this day.
The funds for these projects come mainly from campus and social contributions during the sixty-fourth year, from generous contributions from individuals, and from the support of the Fraternity University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Foundation for Research on Labour Reform.
Until last year, 31 years later, 64 refugees finally received part of their donations from Hong Kong in the name of 64.
During this period, Chinese Rights also independently implemented their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Dr. Ding's call to stop 64 donations is for the sake of the donors, and we are indeed also some retired old people, whose income is not as good as before retirement, and we thank Dr. Ding for his letter to friends.
We will respect the decision of the refugees to terminate the project within two years and resume it immediately if necessary.
Thank you and pay tribute to those heroic and courageous comrades who have persisted for years in giving generously and at the risk of delivering humanitarian aid.

We're working in Beijing, and the best cinemas in Beijing need to be lined up six months in advance, and my colleagues have shot in Beijing, and I think it's just so so.
Specially looking for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and I think this is the short version of most people, photographer Liang Gu will capture and record naturally wonderful moments.
makeup artist, photographer, late design, a good team.
We and everyone around us are very much in favour of it.
She has already recommended her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law has just seen the footage is also full of joy.
I hope that this kind of studio doesn't get buried, that more people find ta, and shoot it in their own style, not in the same way.
Thank you very much for the five-star rating given to Owl and Kei Ling, both of whom are very creative and creative newcomers, and we are creative studios, as long as customers like us, we will do our best to complete, and thank you for meeting each other
A sweet and helpful assistant, and a lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is supernice. It was a beautiful shoot, a hard-to-remember experience, and the result was much better than I had imagined. Everyone worked hard, thank you very much.
Thanks for Xiao Yu's comment. It's also a reason to know you. From Cho and Hao to Qinhuang Island, our trust is thousands of kilometers long. I'm very happy to know you. I'll have the opportunity to visit Qinhuang Island again next time
How do I get the money?
The meal that was re-ordered has been delivered
No rider receiver
Now the restaurant clerk calls me
A programmer who wants to share his personal experience.
If you're going to enter the industry, you can choose to find a place to train, but if you don't think about it, it's better to learn by yourself. After all, training costs a lot of money, and it takes six months to learn.
But if you're going to get into the industry, training is really a good choice, especially for those with self-restraint and weakness, training is a good choice.
If you have more self-restraint, you can choose to learn by yourself, just to be more tired.
It is of course very important to choose a good training institution.
First of all, look at the faculty strength of this institution, if the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institute has no meaning, of course some newly opened training institutes are not particularly strong.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is best to look for the students who came out of the institution, after all only the students of the institution know what the institution is like, whether the course is good or bad.
Hello, in fact I don't know how to answer the question you asked, because there's no specific introduction to your own situation, and learning this thing has a lot to do with your own situation.
For example, your profession, your age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you live in, all have to do with the profession you are studying or wanting to pursue.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you have graduated from the computer specialty, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Nowadays, many online training institutions are actually very good, but one study costs high, the other spends more time, and basically needs to concentrate training 3-6
But if I say these things, self-study is convenient, now a lot of learning resources on the network are free, or go to b station also a lot of training resources, if you don't find resources, you can also contact me by introduction, get free resources, or detailed advice as well.
There are also some more classic books combined with video integrated learning.
If you are not a computer professional, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then recommend going to training institutions to study, so learning does not take a lot of effort, the teacher explains in detail, there are questions and someone specialized in answering, in addition to learning planning or supervision also help.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal appointments, after study recommend to the company, so that the interview process after looking for work can save a lot of things.
These are some of my points of view. Because I don't know your situation, I'm not going to give you any details. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time to communicate.
I said it was 1 o'clock, and I saw the app
What's the name
I haven't finished. What are you doing?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall hanging stove heater, clean waterer, washing machine, air conditioner, bucket, stove head, oil tobacco machine, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional sewing, domestic service
Thank you to those who gave me a silent applause and struggled hard to live a very tired life but to continue
Life will not injure every hardworking person, just pay attention to me if you like, and thank those who praise me silently
Life is like this, others only see the result, self-support process, face life, we are only strong, continue, have no choice, the way can look back but can not go back ...
Maintaining cleanliness is a job, it is also a duty, life is beautiful because of service, service is wonderful because of heart.
Cleaning Although we do the dirtiest work, but we will clean clean every corner of the customer house with the most serious attitude, see the customer's happy smile and raised thumb, that moment all the fatigue is worth it, pay the reward!
My daily work
--Your request, my service.
Mindful service, mindful cleansing, keeping good.
The details you care about, Feng Gui home affairs will help you to do "clean" I can, service the family.
Preserve the houses clean, the tree houses political monuments, the service is in place, clean to the house.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Crystal lamps are beautiful, but they can fade away without cleaning for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, and so is life.
Careful work can succeed, with careful shaping fine, beautiful sewing we are serious.
Give me the opportunity, you will surely be satisfied, quality explains everything, because professional deserves to be trusted, your acknowledgment is my most encouraged!
Every business in the present day is not doing well!
But I have always believed that as long as I have a serious attitude, persistence, and hard work, I will be better than others, at least I will always be stronger than sitting complaining!
The plan of the day is to start in the morning, all the good things start in the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and good intentions. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was something, it was happiness to have; when I was grown up, happiness was a goal, it was happiness to achieve; when I was grown up, I discovered that happiness was a mentality, it was happiness to understand.
Do the most honest and kind of yourself, follow the heart and do it, no regrets in this life; life one way, walk your own way; life two treasures: good body, good heart, beautiful and bright life to old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different difficulties.
Often, it is not your ability, but the courage to face it positively.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it openly.
The more afraid you are, the more difficult it will be to overcome; if you face the difficulty, the problem will be solved.
The first two-year exhibition of contemporary art held in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency
Saudi Arabia's first two-year exhibition of contemporary art - the Riyadh Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary Art - was officially opened to the public on 11 December in the Riyadh JAX Art District, northwest of Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh
The two-year exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Arabian Biennial Exhibition Foundation and the UCCA Yulens Contemporary Art Center of China. The curator of the UCCA Yulens Contemporary Art Center of China, Yuyu Tan, is the artistic director.
According to the exhibition team, the theme of the two-year exhibition is "touching the stone across the river," which symbolizes the reform strategy adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This two-year exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition hall crosses six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: Touching the stone across the river, Inheritance as an experiment, Border thinking, Going to the public, Beautiful New World.
The number of works by 27 Saudi artists accounts for more than a quarter of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation and performing arts. Likewise, the work of 12 Chinese artists is attracting attention. Some artists use recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Yi in the story series behind the scenes
"We hope that this biennial exhibition will create an international dialogue, give global audiences an opportunity to get to know the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia and strengthen interactions," said Bakli, chief executive of the Diliyah Biennial Exhibition Foundation.
"The goal of the biennial exhibition is twofold: to bring Saudi contemporary art into the global dialogue, and to bring Saudi audiences into the world of contemporary art," said Taqiu.
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the two-year opening week. Artists, curators and creative industry opinion leaders will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and Standardizing the Management of Public Service Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming (December 12, Daily Telegraph) (Reporter Lin Beifeng) said that the Yunnan province has recently adopted a policy to promote rural revitalization and the management of public offices in rural areas to help promote rural revitalization in general.
According to the relevant heads of the Office of Social Welfare in Yunnan Province, at present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million rural public utility jobs for the employment of rural hard-pressed groups such as the labor force to help the people out of poverty achieve employment gains, consolidate the achievements of the struggle against poverty, and effectively enhance the capacity of various public services in the countryside.
The new regulations will be issued jointly by the seven departments of Yunnan People's Association, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc., and will mainly uniformly regulate the scope, fund management, job development and job management of rural public service personnel recruited at the grassroots level.
With regard to the establishment of position development, the new rules are clear and will be established in accordance with the principles of "posting as needed, posting people, dynamic management, total control" "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one-on-one, voluntary open, unified management".
The recruitment procedure must be conducted in accordance with the steps of announcement, declaration, verification, publicity, recruitment, pre-employment training and the arrangement of post-employment.
Furthermore, the new regulations clarify the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public service posts, the standards of subsidies for rural public service posts, and the method of subsidies. They stipulate that the development departments of rural public service posts should purchase accident and injury business insurance for the persons to be placed in rural public service posts, and require the relevant departments to regularly issue subsidies for rural public service posts

Secondly, although the right-wing party has a time of ambition in history, but it is not long, so short because giving a little sunshine is brilliant, drinking a little water is sweating; a little ambition is Long looking at Shu, and being hit, it will be the same.
But in reality, the right has played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From defining the standards of truth at the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right should not be denied.
As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very concerned about his statements and respect this man; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory, and I think that it is counter-needed revolution, and revolution will inevitably lead to social instability, civilians will be damaged, and political groups will be mixed with mud and dust, and foreigners will be taken advantage of.
Change or improve China should be patient and responsible for the nation and the people. Political speculators are not right-wing, they are rogue.
Talk to the left again.
The left, in fact, is a bunch of time and politics abandoned.
If the right has positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's speeches and analyze their thoughts when needed, then the left will not do this, because what the left wants is the rotten garbage thrown away by the Communist Party!
Recently, I saw some friends fighting against thieves and fighting left-handedness, and it was very moving, and I didn't think it was necessary.
Don't try to reason with adultery and left-handedness, it's all a thread, unreasonable.
And don't try to prove we're right, and don't think about making anti-theft and left-wing recognition, what is it?
I tell my friends this way: when anti-theft slanders you five hairs, when left mad slanders you right dog, precisely proves our middle way is right!
Many people also had ideals when they were young, and when they got old, they forgot them, or pursued them, and became prejudiced.
Going further and further with ideals, even the boy of the dragon slayer ends up as the evil dragon.
Left and Right I think generally refers to constraint and freedom, China's genes from the birth of historical culture lead to China as a whole should be left.
The right in the country focuses on efficiency and development, and the left on strengthening regulation, and more on fairness and security.
Now society as a whole wants to pay more attention to equity, while the Sino-US conflict, the left-wing is positive, and it is estimated that it will last many years.
Even though I don't understand, a compliment is enough
I didn't say anything. Flowers are so loyal
For the past two years, the blockade and blockade of Huawei chip by the U.S. Embassy has not only put Huawei in an unprecedented dilemma, but also caused enormous losses to the "U.S. department" enterprises.
The direct consequence of this is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in lower R&D investments and lower capacity of the chip manufacturing enterprises, which leads to short supply chains of chip throughout the world.
The shortage of core has now spread to major industries around the world, such as automotive plants, mobile phones, and almost all industries that use chips have been hit hard by it.
In order to grasp the autonomy of "chips," the technology giants of more and more countries began to go on the road of "to beautify."
In order to firmly control global semiconductor control and curb the development of China's semiconductor industry, the U.S. recently hosted the "Chip Summit" and invited 64 giants to form a semiconductor alliance and raise funds to support U.S.-based technology giants such as the U.S.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on the pile of electricity, it was likely to rob the pile of electricity's "dining room".
The reason for this is that Intel, as the oldest technology giant in the U.S., has worked in the semiconductor field for decades and has a large talent pool and technological reserve. It is certain that it will rise rapidly in the short term and defeat the accumulator power plant.
However, Zhang Chung, the founder of MP3, did not heed Intel's decision.
At the "2021 Master Intellectual Property Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Chung expressed surprise at the move to fund Intel's chip factory. Zhang Chung said without hesitation: Intel's chip replacement factory is rather ironic.
Zhang忠谋 is disdainful of Intel's entry into the crystal circle field, because Zhang忠谋 still holds a grudge against the MP3 and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl of the U.S. imperialist manufacturing industry, the world's top leader in semiconductor field.
By the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips had been controlled by a few powerful ones.
At the time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model, where chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by a factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model leaves some small enterprises with a heavy burden, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs face enormous cost of production line construction.
In response to market demand, after the 1980s, the chip industry began to show division of labour and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Chung-chung heard of a company specializing in chip design, and thought that since there is a company specializing in design, it can be founded a factory specialized in crystal production.
Shortly afterwards, Zhang's idea became a reality, and the TV set was born.
Tai Po Electric focuses its main business on the single link of "crystalline processing," not designing, but providing a substitute service for the production of crystalline.
At that time, the newly created stand-up electricity, in front of Intel the giant superpower is small anyway.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Chung had sought Intel's investment, but when Intel heard that Tai Po Electric was only a manufacturing link in the chip industry, obviously some self-esteem was very high, did not see Tai Po Electric, and decided to refuse to invest in Tai Po Electric.
Zhang Chung also determined that Intel was unable to see the crystalline processing service at the time.
I didn't expect to see the giant crystal manufacturing service back then, but now I'm going to start doing crystal replacement.
Thus, Zhang Chung thought it was ironic that Intel entered the crystal processing industry.
The market value of standby electricity has now exceeded Intel.
In the face of the powerful attack of the accumulated electricity, Intel naturally did not dare to stand firm.
Today, standby power is already plugged into 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm seven years ago.
It's not easy to catch up.

Let's look at some strange hot searches today.
What is a normal mood?
Three hot searches were randomly chosen: the February 2 rise of the Dragon, the price hike of the good friend Liyu, the freight rush event, the spread of public opinion forms a wave peak, and then the [index decline] (the smooth curve) finally dissipates, and if there is a secondary public opinion there will be a small hummingbird peak again.
They seem to be different from the [network evolution model] shown on the website of the Internet Trust Agency.
What is the abnormal mood?
Six heat searches in the same event were randomly selected, and the results were shown as isolated peaks, saw teeth, and cliffs.
[孤峰状] means people heat up, quickly push the hot search list to attract public attention; [saw-tooth type] means periodic heating to ensure the topic is on the hot search list; [断崖状] means collective withdrawal, the hot search performed the "function" and received a new task
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event is exactly the wave valley of another event, the time in seconds is no different, it must be the united battalion of navy has received the task, launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black public relations is visible: dozens of hot searches simultaneously appear on the list, which attracts the eye, which is responsible for science and technology, which attracts the battle force, which shifts the viewpoint, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which wraps up decisions, black accounts are distributed in batches
Dissemination is a science that leaves out all subjective factors of positions and emotions, only from objective data, and black public relations can be nowhere hidden.
Anyone who passes will leave traces, such traces, we dig out together.

In Mauritius and other countries, the first case of Omicron poison strain infection was discovered - chinanews.com
Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua Xinhua
Mauritius reported for the first time two cases of the country's Omicron strain infection on October 10.

Great America 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12/F, Happiness House, 156 South Road, Ring Town
At first it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to look at at the beginning my budget is 70,000 to do a basic decoration.
Come to the store and start a series of tricks.
I came to the store for the first time just to show them my home layout, they didn't go to the field to measure the house, they could give me a quote saying that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, about to give me a look at their materials and I don't know what brand materials they are.
Their second trick is to drag you out of the shop as soon as you get to the store (and once you get the money you're never going to get out unless you've had enough experience fighting them theoretically).
When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called managers to tell you how much discount we can give you if you pay the deposit today.
This is a big pit, and I am the example of a lifetime of being deceived, when the brain is busy, to give more than 10,000 deposits.
He offered me a lot of problems 70,000 not including water and electricity upgrades, not including any doors and cabinets and bathrooms, and these three are the main cost of basement.
Apart from these, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost my confidence in the company and didn't say anything clearly at the beginning so I signed the contract.
When I was looking for them to pay back, they showed a lot of experience, and there was a specialized small team to deal with you.
It's a customer's problem to bite to death in any way. They're completely irresponsible.
All kinds of discharge responsibility, there are many details, do not want to say all the tears, in any case don't choose them, because my friends looking for them decorated house is also bad quality, later on you calculate all kinds of costs.
Father, they were the dragonhead decoration of the deceiver, and now they have become great beauty, as if they have collapsed and become others.
So don't choose this kind of dad's decoration company.
Later, when people choose Baidu to look at these check out these advisories because decoration is not small money.

Isn't there another way? For example, by changing the address?
All right, then don't cancel the conversation. If I don't get my money back in 5 to 10 days, I'll investigate.
I asked if it could be canceled within 15 minutes

As the last major meteor shower this year, one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, the meteor shower in the constellation Saturn, will be greatly celebrated on December 14, Xinhua Xinhua reported on Monday (December 12, by reporter Zhou Lung-ken). Friends who like meteor showers can observe it later in the night
A meteor shower in the constellation Twin was photographed in Qinghai province on December 13, 2018.
Most of the meteor shower's parent objects are periodic comets, but the meteor shower's parent object in the constellation is asteroid 3200 Phaeul, which is an Apollo-type asteroid.
The constellation meteor shower is also known to be the second meteor shower not "born" by comets.
Shu Li Peng, director of Tianjin City Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy science and technology, explained that, as with the Great Jubilee Film, meteor showers usually appear at the end of the year, and the "screening period" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is famous for its large and stable flow and is called the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere together with the meteor showers of the X-ray limiting instrument and the meteor showers of Venus.
A remarkable feature of the Pluto meteor shower is that the meteor body is slower, colorful, and there are many Mars meteors, suitable both for sight and for astronomy photography.
Tianjin Astronomy Enthusiast Yang Jian On December 13, 2020 the twin constellation meteor shower was filmed in Tianjin Jianzhou.
Astronomy forecasts show that this year's meteor showers in the constellation of Pluto will be overwhelming at around 15 o'clock on December 14th, when the maximum ZHR (under ideal observation conditions, the amount of meteors visible per hour when the radiation point is right above the top of the head) is 150.
Recommended index graphs of meteor showers in the constellation.
"Last year, the moonlight interfered with the rainfall, but this year's rainfall will be a little less dramatic.
The bright moonlight will interfere with the observation, so that the moon will fall in the middle of the night, and the radiation point of the meteor shower will be higher at this time.
A friend who likes meteor showers can observe the moon in the hours after midnight, but keep an eye on the cold and warmth."
How can we observe as many meteors as possible?
"It is not advisable to observe in the city, but you can choose a high altitude, low light, wide view in the northeast direction in the suburbs or in the countryside, and then wait patiently for the moon to come down and observe with your eyesight.
It should be noted that the flow of meteor showers to all directions is very large, and it is not necessary to keep an eye on the radiation point of meteor showers.
If a friend who likes to take photographs wants to shoot a glamorous movie, it's best to choose a wide angle, large-scale lens, using high ISO and maximum lens.
Based on stability and sustainability considerations, tripods, spare batteries and fast door lines are also essential."
Shu Li Peng reminded me.
What are the differences between laser television and traditional television in market positioning?
In my understanding, the traditional TV the subject says should refer to LCD TV, whereas laser TV and LCD TV differ in market positioning, mainly the following two points:
First, laser television focuses more on the large screen market.
Compared to the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV clearly focuses more on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is the product of the large screen.
Currently, the main LCD TV size is mostly 55 to 65 inches, while the laser TV size is generally more than 75 inches, the largest is more than 100 inches, fully satisfying the consumer's demand for large screen color power.
In recent years, laser television has been increasing in volume and sales in the world, accounting for more than sixty percent of total TV sales of 80 inches or more.
According to Zhong Yi-Kong's forecast, in 2020, sales growth in the laser television market will exceed 140%, and will continue to grow at a fast pace.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser television in eye care.
Based on the long reflection imaging principle of laser television, the light emitted by the laser source does not directly hit the eyeball, compared with the back light emitted by LCD television, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eye is smaller.
The Sixi Laboratory of the China Institute of Electronic Technology Standardization and the eye specialists of the Beijing Co-operative Hospital obtained 144 sets of test data through strict comparison tests of laser television and LCD television viewed in the same conditions in the population.
The data confirms that laser television does have strong eye protection characteristics and even has a certain improvement effect in certain aspects.
In the present time, when vision health is increasingly valued, laser television not only attracts more and more users with eye care advantages, but also opens another breakthrough in color television market.
Secondly, laser television focuses more on the high-end market.
Conversely, the price of LCD TV is constantly falling, and the price of laser TV sold in the market is mostly more than $10,000, and with the increase in size and light source, the price is gradually rising.
Why is laser television so expensive?
There must be a reason for that.
With the constant development of light source and technology level, laser television has many advantages that LCD television and projection cannot realize.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser television is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment, it can realize the experience of 100 inch large screen in a short distance, the space required is small, and the main machine is small, and the space is small.
In terms of brightness, large brand laser television can reach more than 2000 brightness.
Additionally, the heat output is lower, the equipment is less damaged, and the TV lifespan is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser television models also carry the true 4K ultra high-definition image quality, artificial intelligence system, simulation screen, etc., can bring the user more shocking visual and auditory experience.
It's not about fake demand, it's about products that are subdivided by demand, about the quality of the picture and the ratio of input to output, laser television is not a menu for video and audio players, want to take into account both the large screen and the lack of viewing environment, can try, everything is advantageous and disadvantageous, after weighing it out, you can judge it yourself, and you're afraid to listen
Simply put, the ultra wide angle near-focus projector, laser television, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lenses and reflectors in order to attach close to the screen, which is not the best optical design.
In order to shield some of the ambient light, the use of a microstructure fiber screen is expensive, and the price of 80 centimetres can basically replace a 65 centimetre LCD.
Another thing, I particularly hate projection manufacturers to take the long reflection to the eye good as a selling point, please, the light that the eye can see on the curtain is direct rays to the eye, you reflect to the ceiling, the eye can't see, not really LCD TV is also long "right
Furthermore, projection screens can't make a picture if they don't reflect at all.
It is precisely ignored the thermal spot (light spot) effect of high gain screen cloth, at a certain angle a lot of light reflects to the eyes, that is really hard to accept.
Fine Arts and Visual Aesthetics Photography Gallery Selected Quality Shop There is no branch shop for the time being

Before going to see the shooting work in the shop, more is outdoor wedding dress, the shot is very beautiful, there is also a lot of shooting style involved.
The day came after and little sister simply exchanged their own ideas, very patiently helped me try two sets of style clothes I corrected, finally decided to start make-up modeling ~ the photographer will put some tools before shooting, will guide the action, and to each detail also more thoroughly.
But maybe because I didn't share specific shooting ideas with you, it's not the style I wanted, but it should be nice.
After shooting, the photographer will help select the photos, communicate the late style, feel very careful.
It takes about half a month for a good film to be repaired.
The second part of the photo class is the Hebrew meal activity ~ most of the clothes in the whole area can choose one to shoot.
Finally, I chose a black dress and experienced a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, make-up + shooting, the photographer responsible for shooting is the brother after 95, it feels a little bit darker, I hope to be able to give more advice in terms of customer shooting action guidance afterwards ~ pretty talkative, the shooting process is more enjoyable.

[Service] Very enthusiastic, very attentive.
The model is very patient.
The photographer will also teach you very carefully how to move.
If not satisfied, the photographer will also propose a patch.
[Experience] Maybe the modeling is a bit overdue, the original double-eye skin was glued out of the tri-eye skin.
The eyebrows are also shaved, and it's a little embarrassing not to draw eyebrows on a daily basis.
The photo was given ten days ago, but the effect of the P photo is not very satisfactory, feeling that the eyelids are sticking those still very obvious.

Is it reasonable to buy insurance for a small umbrella?
The umbrella is an Internet insurance broker platform.
From the setting conditions: According to the advice of the Regulation of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (Amendment of 2015), to become an insurance brokerage company, it must meet three key keywords: shareholders and initiators have no significant illegal records in the last three years, the minimum amount of RMB 5,000,000 can be established, and it must be approved by the China Insurance Supervisory Board
These three articles are actually very strict. In summary, it is necessary to have the strength to pass the approval of the national authority department of the Banking Supervisory Board (which supervises insurance companies and banks in the country), shareholders to have a good manner, as an insurance brokerage company umbrella insurance, the insurer does not need too much doubt umbrella insurance
In this respect, it's good, it's trustworthy.
From the point of view of insurance products: Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, many companies are selling star sickness insurance on this platform, such as the latest and Tai Super Mary 5 sickness insurance, the claimant and insurer are all Tai Life, umbrella insurance is only a third party intermediary, no doubt
From the payment mode: Internet platform products, because there are fewer operating costs of business networks, and the cost of business staff, so Internet products are generally more cost-effective, and the payment mode is flexible, supports monthly payment, relieves the insurer's payment pressure, and at the same time can maximize the leverage of insurance.
This is still very good.
Think about it.
In terms of professionalism, this is especially important, because insurance is a profession that demands great professionalism, and many Internet products customers can provide insurance on their own. This creates a lot of misunderstandings, and non-insurance practitioners often add their own opinions when they provide insurance
I myself used to sell insurance phones at Tencent Microinsurance (as with the umbrella, which is also an Internet insurance broker platform), and I told everyone that I was very responsible.
Internet insurance is true, and reliable, and unreliable is the person, the Internet channel has no professional practitioners, and there are many sales misleading.
These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are easy to avoid, and they do not tell the policyholder that 1 yuan in the first month and 200 yuan in the next month will be required at the normal rate, depending on the number of dozen to 200
Thinking it could cost one dollar, the insurance company claimed six million (the world lost pies).
Free mobile phones are sent at the end of the insurance policy, such as 6666,8888, which is the special insurance policy section, and if the winner sends a text message, they will not exchange it, nor will anyone be reminded.
(This is another pitfall for policyholders) Free 60,000 sickness insurance is short-term, if it's just this, there's no other business risk, if there's serious sickness, 60,000 can't do anything, can't solve the problem, and life begins to run wild.
At present, the country is also severely punished for misleading internet insurance sales.
So in general, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional conduct of the businessman.
In fact, the products of many underground insurance brokerage companies are more wide, customers can choose more opportunities and products, and some products have better cost-effectiveness than Internet products.
I myself helped 59 Internet customers to save 2000-3000 yuan per year on products under coverage.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate with me.
I:Mingya Insurance broker, has three years of enterprise management training experience, serves over thousands of enterprise users, cooperates with more than 100 insurance companies, before insuring, I will start from customer demand, customize insurance products for customers, in insuring, for customers' goods more than three times, complete
Grow up with every client for life.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory department, Internet insurance is the insurance business in which the insurer can independently complete all the insurance process after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the insurer does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the insurer on his own.
Although Internet insurance coverage is not so " ritualistic" and perhaps even printed paper contracts are not, this does not affect the effectiveness and legal validity of electronic contracts at all.
This model is a bit like the telephone sales business, but there is also a fatal problem with purchasing insurance in this way, which is that follow-up services may not follow.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, shouldn't we think carefully about the "intermediator" we choose, or an "intermediator" who can accompany us for a long time and also provide us with services many years later?
So how can I get in touch with the catering clerk

Just replenish the discount code
No problem, remember I don't have to arrange a return, I've already bought something else, I don't want to waste it
Thank you for your help
From before to now, I have been opposed to any form of slander and curse, and can no longer accept such acts of personal attack.
In a civilized society, we can embrace everything, but it is to eliminate this villain.
If you don't look at the political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized style.
I've been reluctant to respond from the time you started to send me Facebook requests and friend requests and then post funny posts, to the time you tried to post my so-called home address and father's name on social media.
You've changed your mind sharply, not only by continuing to eat six meals a day, but also by continuing to discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook some obscure, shameful statements about me, my appearance, my body, my well-being, what kind of strawberries I want to plant in bed
How do I know later I've received more than a few friends to send me comments about your face book with a photo of you and sexually harassment components on a friend's account.
I'm sorry, as a girl, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After I posted the news of the alarm, you didn't converge at all. Instead, you got more and more furious.
I don't care what your political background is, nor what your status is. In our society, gender respect is required.
Yes, you can continue to say that you are just loving and caring for me, you can continue to think that this is not harassment, you can even continue to deny that this is not your drawing, or you can continue to make all kinds of offensive comments.
Yeah, I can't and I can't stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body don't need your comment anymore.
I don't even think any girl would want someone to shame herself so much in exchange for a name.
My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said good, you wouldn't believe it.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being so bully.
Whether in work, society, politics or business, only those who have no basic morality will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that honesty is self-evident.
I cut off some of the messages and commented on them
Your own post shouldn't be taken for granted by anybody
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization

Three U.S. carriers gather around China The most powerful weapon rarely visits Guangdong Island 2022-01-17 多維 亲CCP media多维报道: The latest news on Sino-US relations: The latest satellite image shows three U.S. carriers gather around China; American media also revealed the most powerful weapon in the U.S. naval arsenal
On January 9, the satellite discovered the carrier of the USS Carl Vinson near the Barabak Strait, according to the China Intelligence Agency's "Strategic Situation Sensing Platform for the South China Sea".
The Barabak Strait, which connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, is a strategic point in the chain of the first islands of the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to deploy Car Wilson to the South China Sea.
This was the first deployment of the Carrier Carrier Wilson on board the F-35C fighter aircraft and the CMV-22 "Fish Eagle" transport aircraft.
The U.S. carriers that are now sailing over the Pacific, in addition to Car Wilson, are also the carriers that departed from the United States on January 3, USS Abraham Lincoln.
Lincoln also first boarded the F-35C Carrier Squadron, which belonged to the 314th Fighter Assault Squadron of the United States Marine Corps.
In addition to the two carriers mentioned above, the US Navy is currently deployed in the Asia-Pacific region with the USS Ronald Reagan carrier stationed in Yokohama, Japan.
The carrier battle group also included the Missile Cruiser "Shangplan Lake" and the Missile Destroyer "Stokdar".
Three U.S. carriers gather around China The most powerful weapon rarely visits Guam On January 17, 2022, the South China Strategy Situation Sensing Platform released the latest satellite image showing three U.S. carriers gathering around China.
(Weblog @ South China Strategy Situation) Three US carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visited Guam On January 17, 2022, the U.S. Navy flew the CMV-22B flight route.
One of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal visited Guam on a rare occasion last weekend, according to CNN on January 17.
USS Nevada, a Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US Naval Base at Guam on Saturday (January 15th).
Three US carriers gather around China's most powerful weapons rarely visit Guam Analysts say this sends a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a U.S. ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US carriers gather around China The most powerful weapons rarely visit Guangdong China has built a large number of military facilities in the South Sands Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China's Longhua Island in the South Sands Islands.
(The South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit to Guam by the Ohio-class nuclear submarine Nevada strengthened cooperation between the U.S. and its regional allies, demonstrating the ability, flexibility, readiness to fight, and security and stability in the Indian region
Ballistic missile submarines are often referred to as "Boomer submarine".
The tracking of 14 of the U.S. Navy's torpedo submarines is usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding the ballistic missile submarine makes the雷鸣 submarine the "most important surviving weapon in the nuclear triangle," a system that includes well-guided ballistic missiles launched on the mainland of the United States, as well as bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads, such as B-2 and B-52.
Speaking to friends about the recent 26 per cent decline in Meta, the market capitalization stepped up by $2510 billion, Zackberg responded "with unprecedented competition," why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, the revenue mainly comes from advertising, nowadays the advertising company that makes money today, itself has a flow channel.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc., whatever the function location, are all Meta traffic channels.
Not only that, Meta is the largest "advocacy alliance", many apps externalize Meta's ads, through Meta's advertising platform is realized transformation.
But the times have changed.
First, because of Apple's privacy policy adjustment, Meta is finding it difficult to retrieve data information from users, affecting the efficiency of advertising.
Apple's current privacy policy is very friendly to users and will clearly indicate whether users allow the App to access their information, and most people's normal reaction is definitely not allowed.
Next, if Google presses another knife, the impact on Meta's revenues will be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in previous Meta revenue growth has also weakened (the weight of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta doesn't have any business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
Every year, at least 10% of Meta's revenue comes from China, mainly from companies contributing to China's maritime business.
Meta has about a hundred offices in Hong Kong and several major agents in mainland China.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an insurmountable advertising channel, most of the money burned is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of the dictionary is now one of Meta's main competitors, but the previous two years Meta made a lot of money from the dictionary.
Every agency in the country is helping the dictionary to Meta to advertise there, Meta Greater China Region's performance is also very good.
I haven't been studying that much lately, but I'm sure it won't be better than before.
The stage of large-scale overseas burning of money by Chinese companies has passed.
Thirdly, the new flow channels are not expanding smoothly.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just a decline in income, but a lack of growth expectations.
Capital markets look not only at middle income, but more importantly at the future expectations.
It is clear that Meta’s expectations are not sufficient.
Zackberg talked about the universal in order to tell a new story to the market.
Genspace should indeed be one of the future directions, but the implementation cycle of Genspace is longer, and this story should not be enough to support Meta's market capitalization in the next two or three years.
So the next two years should be a more difficult period for Meta.
Don't look at Facebook. It's very popular now, and it has revenues of 10 billion to 20 billion dollars a year. In fact, Facebook has a very strong sense of crisis, and compared to other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there's nothing better to protect the city.
Although some of his social software is now higher in daily life, it is also the mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, etc., but faced with the rapid development of Tiktok, Facebook has little confidence, and the reversal is a blink of an eye.
