A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase in a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he didn't know who would want to hurt him, and that "it's finally all right.
The San Francisco coroner's office said the body found at the West End Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was confirmed to be Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death case was determined to be his killing and is under investigation.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the San Francisco-based radio station KGO that Frank, who had previously worked as a sewer cook in Boston, had found an ideal job six months ago at Sons & Daughters' restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "very shocked" by Frank's death.
"We're a small team with an intimate family and we'll miss him deeply," the spokesman said.
At this sad moment, we express our deepest sympathy and condolences to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said Frank lived in the inn at first, but recently "it's all finally getting better."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "Frank found an apartment and was dating a girl."
Louis Galicia said he did not know who would want to harm his brother.
Frank has a kind heart and a broad breast.
"Frank often cooks dinner for his family," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to argue with his family.
He is a man who follows everyone's advice.
"Everything in the world can be wrong," said Louis Galicia, "but Frank is a kind of everyday, out-of-the-box guy.
If you have any clues, please call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Primary doctors strike: call for new labour action
The primary doctors' representatives called on the union to approve new labour action against new contract disputes.
The British Medical Association's Board of Primary Physicians will ask its entire membership to start supporting more labour action in early September.
The first doctors' committee said the ministers had not resolved their concerns about the contract.
Primary doctors and medical students voted against a contract deal with the British Medical Association in July.
Of those who voted, 58 percent opposed the deal.
In a letter to members on Twitter late Thursday, First Doctors' Committee Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government "has always remained silent" on the issues that led to the contract being rejected.
"In view of this, the Executive Committee of the First Doctors' Committee has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and calls for formal consultations to be resumed on all concerns," she said.
In response to the government's silence, the Executive Committee of the First Doctors' Committee has today formally requested a special meeting of the British Medical Association Council to approve a long-term plan to upgrade labour action from early September.
The dispute has led to a total of six strikes by junior doctors this year, including the first full-scale strike in the history of the UK's national health care system.
Dr. Johann Malawana, the Chief Medical Officer of the British Medical Association, resigned after the contract terms recommended by the British Medical Association were voted down.
At a meeting before the 54,000 primary doctors and medical students voted, he told members of the British Medical Association that the deal was good and should therefore be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be enforced on English nurses.
Russia and Turkey: "Gog does not join the alliance"?
A gesture ends a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally end an eight-month row of talks and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish president in a magnificent hall of gold in St Petersburg’s palace, I had a strong feeling: this reconciliation was Ankara’s most hoped-for.
Yes, both of them did shake hands.
However, even by Mr. Putin’s usual convergent standards, Mr. Putin only smiles and barely expresses his enthusiasm.
It has been reported that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has referred to Putin five times as his "good friend".
I can't remember.
At the same time, he promised that relations with Russia would return to the pre-crisis level, and even to a higher level.
The next day, a newspaper was written, and Mr. Eldon appeared as if nothing had happened.
But I think his enthusiasm suggests something quite the opposite.
However, Mr Putin’s persistent coolness indicates that he has not forgotten anything.
Indeed, the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
The reaction in Moscow at the time was intense.
Mr Putin attacked the incident sharply, accusing Ankara of spying on Moscow.
Attacks from so-called friends are more unacceptable.
It is difficult and even impossible for both sides to rebuild genuine trust.
Since November, Russian public opinion has also shifted.
In recent months, the government-controlled media has launched an alarming full-scale attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seem to be responsible for everything.
Among them, the most serious was the accusation from senior officials that Mr Erdoğan's family had profited from illegal oil trade in the so-called Islamic-controlled Syrian region.
He has categorically denied such a statement.
However, the news from St. Petersburg indicated that it was time to look ahead.
After all, the premise of the meeting was that Putin would receive an apology from Turkish President Erdogan.
Russia can declare victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a truce are obvious.
First, Erdoğan risked being ousted after the failure of last month’s coup d’état, so he needed the support of all his friends.
The constant terrorist attacks have clearly hit him hard.
There are also economic incentives.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, particularly by banning airliners that transport millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
That figure has dropped sharply to nearly 90 per cent.
As flights resume, Russian travel agencies and airline companies will be relieved.
They will see a wave of Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
National Television even predicted this week that the prices of fruits and vegetables would fall once Turkish agricultural imports are reopened.
A report in the Moscow newspaper Vedemosti said: "The tourists have gone, the tomatoes have come back.
For Moscow, the visit has added political value.
Ankara is angry at the weak reaction of the Western world to the intention to take over.
In addition, Ankara has long been dissatisfied with the slow progress of EU accession negotiations and Putin’s involvement, who is keen to exploit political coldness and weaken Turkey’s relations with the Western world.
Russia’s leaders will gain Ankara’s credit for supporting the elected authorities after the failure of the coup.
Note that this is a gift to Moscow, which has always had a deep-rooted fear of regime change.
Thus, the meeting at this glittering seaside palace has made Russia and Turkey allies with two countries that the Western world has refused to treat as abusers, an analyst described as "Greg's not in the alliance."
However, despite open reconciliation, there are still significant differences between the two sides.
Syria is one of the key factors: Moscow has recently played a role in Syria, while Russia and Turkey have backed the opposite.
As can be expected, after nearly three hours of preliminary talks, the two presidents stated at the press conference that they had not yet discussed the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about differences between the two sides, while Putin emphasized them.
No clear consensus has been reached on how to reconcile on the Syrian issue.
With the possibility that Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, could launch a major catastrophe and open hostilities over the months of the Russian warplane strikes, it is surely a good thing that the two leaders have reopened the dialogue.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland
The bank will be simplified into a logistics department, the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland said.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer serve customers outside Scotland.
Ross McQueen told BBC Scotland that the Royal Bank of Scotland brand was committed to its global ambitions.
But eight years ago it was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to accept rescue and had abandoned the pursuit since then.
At that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
The group has spent millions of pounds sponsoring international sporting events such as the rugby Six Nations and Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But now the right thing to do is to bring more national brands to the forefront.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for its customers in Scotland, but will not return the original.
In England and Wales, all proposals outside the headquarters and the stock exchange will be converted to National Westminster Bank.
The Alster Bank brand has been used by customers in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Autonomous Region.
There are other more prominent smaller private banking brands, such as Guangdong Bank, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McQueen was interviewed during a tour of clients and employees in Inventory County.
"The brand of the Royal Bank of Scotland will eventually become our investor brand and one of our employees' brands," he told BBC Scotland. "We are now, in a larger sense, a bank with many brands.
As the bank itself became an international brand, RBS also became a global brand.
At the moment, what I want to say is that we are no longer focusing on the world, we are focusing on the mainland.
Each brand represents different industries, and our employees serve customers through different brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations Championships; at the same time, efforts have been made to raise the profile of different brands sponsoring sporting events.
"It's time to become a multi-brand bank," said the chief executive, "because we've been privately exploring how to become a better customer bank.
If three years ago we set out to become a big bank with many brands, we would be ridiculed.
At present we focus on customer demand and I am sure you have noticed these changes.
I think we can restart these brands, and the time is right.
Deutilly won 3,000 career wins with Predilection in Newmarket
Newmarket's two victories helped Detoury win 3,000 career wins, after which he celebrated champagne
On Friday, professional rider Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory at Newmarket.
His predilection, drawn from the hand of a self-taught horseman, John Gosden, rushed on the track, earning two victories that night and 3,000 career victories.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth professional cyclist to achieve this milestone in the field of flat track.
The first five were Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
"It's very special," said the three-time runner-up in Ghayyar, David Turley.
I'm very excited because my family is also on the scene
I am pleased with the achievements I have made in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
This is not a large-scale race, nor is it the Royal Ascot, which is just an ordinary Friday evening with 20,000 spectators.
I am glad and humble.
Deutilly brought Predilection after the victory, which caused a lot of applause
In the obstacle course, two riders achieved this achievement, champion rider Richard Johnson and now retired 20th-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with more than 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Berger won nine German championships and won 4,493 victories in his career
It is not surprising that he achieved this milestone, one of the best riders of his time, and that few have achieved it before him.
He is fashionable and strong, but what really makes him stand out in the weight room is his tactical rationality.
He is a remarkable ambassador to horse racing, and over the years his enthusiasm and charm have attracted a lot of fans to the sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Epsom to Deutily that he should have won 6,000 races if he hadn't just been racing for a weekend!
To be honest, it's too important that Deutilly is the best horse racing winner in Britain in thirty years.
His character is lively, which is good for British horse racing, but besides, he is also an incredible rider.
Deutilus celebrated this milestone with his iconic jumping.
For twenty years, Deutilly has been a typical representative in the field of flat track racing in England, from the jumping line to the jumping horse.
His career is like a mountain bike.
He won several championships, including the famous "seven consecutive victories" at the 1996 Royal Essex Championships, but he also suffered a crash and was banned from racing due to drug use.
Three years ago, when he returned to the field after a six-month suspension, he was once very tough, but he showed an amazing personality advantage and finally returned to the top to be the leader for those who are skeptical.
He may not be able to do it for too long--Dattori had said before that he hoped to compete at least by the age of 50.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly relieved Sergei Ivanov of his post as head of the presidential office.
For years, Mr Ivanov has been a member of the core group deeply trusted by Mr Putin.
Ivanov, now 63, has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Mr Putin had "declared the dismissal of Ivanov as head of the Russian presidential office," but gave no reasons.
Anton Vaino, who started as Mr Ivanov's deputy in 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr Vaino is 44 years old and a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the famous Moscow National Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he managed the presidential draft and government staff, as it were, the Kremlin website (in Russian).
After being appointed, he said to Mr Putin, "Thank you for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of our Government is to support the drafting of laws and the implementation of control directives by Heads of State.
Mr Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Mr Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended Mr Vaino to take over.
Is such a smile convincing?
Moscow is confused about this.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest allies, and, like Putin, worked for the Soviet Security Agency (KGB).
As head of the office, he was one of the most influential people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on national television, both claimed that the chief of staff had himself asked for his resignation.
Despite smiles in front of the cameras, hardly anyone believed -- especially before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nothing is known yet.
But official statements – that a former presidential candidate had suddenly chosen to rule Russia’s environmental policy – have raised a lot of doubts.
The Kremlin website quoted Mr Ivanov's conversation with Mr Putin as saying, "Yes, at the beginning of 2012, I asked you in a conversation to give me this difficult, even troublesome, four-year term of office."
"As a result, I've been running the president's office for four or eight months."
Mr Ivanov was appointed in December 2011.
Before that he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Mr Putin, a former member of the National Security Bureau.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin was appointed Director of the Federal Security Bureau (FSB, formerly the National Security Bureau), Mr. Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
After Mr Putin took office, he also appointed Mr Ivanov as one of his top five trustees.
It was once believed that Mr Ivanov might become President of Russia at the end of Mr Putin's second term, because three re-elections were contrary to the Constitution.
But the post ultimately belonged to another close aide to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Mr. Putin served as Russian Prime Minister until his re-election three and a half years later.
The Mysterious Fish Surprises Banff Garden
A resident of Banff found a fish in his garden, who then called for help.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish may have been sea urchins blown by tornadoes.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters away from the sea, posted a video of the strange scene on Periscope in hopes that someone could explain to him why the two-inch fish appeared.
The Queens Ferry Bridge has now reached Favre
The £13.5 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017
Engineers have linked the north side of the Queensferry Crossing to the elevated bridge, which now leads to Favre.
Four bridge wind turbines near each of the three bridge headquarters are nearing completion and this project is the first of its kind.
The bridge, originally built in Frankfurt, is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 metric tons.
It uses 10,000 metric tons of steel, 20,000 metric tons of concrete and 46 slopes.
The £13.5 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economy, visited the site today and became one of the first people to board the bridge.
"This is a historic moment in the construction of the Queens Ferry Bridge," he said.
We have all witnessed the work on such a large project, where more than 30,000 metric tons of concrete and steel were used just for this section of the bridge.
Although the size and weight of the bridge are enormous, completion of the joint between the bridge and the surface of the bridge requires careful work and very precise installation.
Overall, nearly 79 per cent of the total bridge has now been installed, and the last concrete bridge is today being poured at Rosyth, which means that all the bridges are ready to go.
Michael Martin, project director at the Queens Ferry Bridge Construction Company, said: "A major milestone is the first bridge project, no matter what it is."
In terms of the excellent project, this joint showcases the frontier of civil engineering technology.
After installing the last section of the road panel and connecting it to the expanded North Bridge fort road panel, the remaining gaps on the north side or near the land side need to be filled.
To complete the operation, the northern elevation bridge would have to be moved 700 mm south.
This is a large-scale task and also a very precise one.
It is said to be huge because the high bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 metric tons, requiring a slope of about 3%.
It's precise because the engineering team needs to ensure that the deviation is very small, just a few millimeters on each side.
Fortunately, everything went smoothly.
Simon Byers wins women's gymnastics championship
Forget the pressure.
Forget about being fired.
Simon Biles was not affected by all of this.
Jumping is full of vitality.
Balance the edges of the trees.
The free-style gymnastics moves are amazing.
The overall performance was excellent.
Now, finally became the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the full-energy championship on Thursday, fully demonstrating her world-leading talent in gymnastics on the Olympic field.
She won the silver medal with 62.198 points, along with the "Final Five" teammate Ali Raisman and bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simon-Bairs of the United States performed a balanced woodworks performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday in the finals of the women's individual full-length gymnastics competition.
Byers helped the U.S. team win four consecutive Olympic women's gymnastics individual titles, winning five medals at the Games, further proving her to be one of the best gymnasts of her generation, and perhaps the best ever.
Byers couldn't help tears when she saw herself divided. She finally ended the long journey.
Byers thus joins the ranks of "decades-on-decade athletes" like Michael Phelps, who have elevated sports projects in their respective fields to new heights:
For the past three years, Byers has been the champion and has won 15 World Championship medals, including ten gold medals. "Byers has been the best gymnast I've ever seen," says 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, who has worked hard every day to achieve greater accuracy.
There's a final match in Brazil, but it's not a match that compares her to the competition of other gymnasts, but rather her own to the huge expectations of pressure.
If Byers hadn't returned to her home in Springs, Texas full of gold, everyone would have been very disappointed.
Simon Byers of the United States (left) and Leshman embrace each other, winning gold and silver medals respectively at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August (Thursday).
Byers won his first gold medal on Tuesday, giving a surprise welcome to retired national team coach Martha Karolyi.
While Bears insists that he has no plans for the future as he continues to occupy the championship seat, this is not the case.
The part of the ballet, which included her iconic jumping strings, was accompanied by Latin music, which she often heard in her apartment only one block away from the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is no coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted as a baby by her grandparents and discovered by her mother, coach Amy Boorman, during a field trip to the stadium, is now a strong middle-class girl.
Since the summer of 2013, Byers has never lost in a full-fledged event, and she will win if she wants to win.
After two rounds of rotation, Mustafa's lead was only a hallucination.
The two world champions in balanced trees and freestyle gymnastics, Bears buried to wait.
She scored 15.433 in equilibrium trees and 15.933 in gymnastics.
As he waited for the final score to come out, Raisman hugged Bears gently. Bears tears when he learned that he had achieved his dreams.
Lehman's performance was a bit like a revenge against four years ago, when she finished third, but lost to Mustafa in the final.
But this time, the 22-year-old captain, played by the Americans as "Grandma," was far ahead.
She kissed the crowd at the end of the free-style exercise and announced her return, but such a return sometimes seemed questionable before.
Byers, 19 years old, whose message has spread virally on Twitter since early this week, has been given a new meaning to his life.
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown escapes a Philadelphia shooting
Police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The children's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia that the child shot was Mahaj Brown.
They said Brown had several gunshot wounds in the abdomen, pelvis, legs, arms and abdomen, but the child was awake on the way to medical attention.
"He has suffered many sins, and his little body has been shot to the bones," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the TV.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in a very serious condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
His family told the TV that the child was expected to recover.
He was supposed to start in first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown area.
Of the three others shot, two were 29 years old and one 32 years old.
According to CBS Philadelphia, one of the 29-year-old victims was in critical condition and the other two were stable.
The television said the child and the 29-year-old victim were found in front of the car.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether there were gunmen among the injured.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia it looked like several gunmen were firing.
A number of explosive shells were found on the scene, suggesting that they were using different types of weapons.
From this conclusion, it is undoubtedly a continuous war.
People on both sides of the street had shells on their sidewalks.
“Therefore, it can be seen that there were a number of armed men on the scene at the time,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many houses and vehicles were damaged in the area.
The arrests have not yet been carried out and police are said to be watching the surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was shot in the arm while playing at the door of the West Oak Lane community.
She is now recovering and the police are still pursuing the suspects.
Why do we need Simon, Gabriel and Laurie
That's how I evaluate this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, but the United States has never been so dominant.
Second, the gymnastics team has three outstanding gymnasts – Simon Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez – who have inspired many girls of color.
The team's composition made everyone more proud, as it included Jewish Ali Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian.
The team finally looked like the American team.
It also consolidated the top position of black and Latino women in the sport.
For the past four years, the leading female gymnasts have been non-Americans.
Last year, Simon and Gabriel placed first and second.
That's too bad.
The United States has been cheered by Gabriele Douglas' surprising victory at the last Olympics.
Today, the world can witness three world champions Simon Byers, Douglas and Laurie Elnandez performing brilliantly, deducing the conventional gymnastic skills into a divine enlightenment.
Simon helped the U.S. team win four consecutive titles in the women's individual all-around event on Thursday.
Her teammate Ali Lesman won the silver.
We have reached the peak of the sport, but not in the gym class.
Simon, Gabriele and Laurie entered the Olympic team in the same way as Ali and Madison.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic team will be made up of four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport, with gymnasts mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs and their parents having to pay for training, facilities, travel, clothing, competitions and hotel expenses (including coaches and related expenses for gymnasts and their families), and the list of expenses is growing.
Most gym clubs are located in affluent suburbs that can support the industry.
All training for gymnasts is done in these clubs, which is a long-term and expensive expense for the gymnasts' families.
Byers coach Amy Boorman and Ernandez coach Maggie Haney have coached the two athletes since they started practicing.
We must bring more effective and affordable physical training to the many young girls who have been influenced by Simon, Gabriele and Laurie.
20 years ago, I founded my own gym foundation.
Within my organization, we offer free, low-cost exercises to more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Hispanic Americans) in black residential areas, and train national and even world champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve this learning opportunity and who will benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Exercise helps to cultivate the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, and also helps to cultivate the spirit of endurance, self-discipline and determination.
These can bring lifelong benefits to a person's health, academic and work success.
Inspired by this team, thousands of young girls will learn gymnastics, which is really great.
Participation in sports is important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting moment.
Thanks to Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabrielle and Madison for the "girls' power" they displayed in winning the gold medals in the Olympic group, and for inspiring young girls from so many different backgrounds to embark on a path to health, strength and success.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected, the primary doctors planned to launch further strikes
Ministers initially hoped to end the dispute by accepting a revised contract from British Medical Association (BMA) officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 primary doctors who voted against the contract.
In July, Mr Hunter revealed plans to enforce contracts, saying the NHS was in a "vacuum zone" and that any delay would harm the interests of employees and patients.
The new contract first mentions amendments to the routine of day-to-day and weekend work of primary doctors in order to improve the conditions of nursing during abnormal working hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of BMA's first doctors committee, said in a statement last night, "First doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will exacerbate the current labor crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks left before the first doctors sign the new contract, and we need to make progress.
The BMA tries to resolve disputes through negotiations, but everyone is reluctant to participate, and sometimes the government responds in silence.
Nevertheless, just last month we got Jeremy Hunt's promise that his doors would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt now needs to take action to abolish coercion and address the concerns of primary doctors.
If he does not do so, the primary doctors make it clear that they are ready to take further labour action.
The last strike occurred at the end of April, resulting in the delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments due to nurses and attending physicians covering up doctors on the check-in line.
The ministers initially hoped to end the dispute caused by the changes by accepting the revised BMA contract.
BMA hopes to get better weekend wages for the 54,000 primary doctors involved in the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on primary doctors not to stage any more strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: "Labour action has little effect, but on the contrary, it puts pressure on the already dedicated teams and services, causing concern, anxiety and confusion among patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have been engaged in ongoing negotiations with the Board of Primary Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and other departments, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of carers and the disclosure of reports.
Employers want to continue actively exploring other important topics, such as deployment, training flexibility, other training for those who re-engage after a career break, training costs, common understanding of curriculum curricula, gender pay gaps in advanced leave and health care, which illustrate the importance of the agreements reached with BMA in November, February, and May by employers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart disease
Officials have suggested extending a two-pound daily drug to more patients and extending its duration, which could benefit thousands of heart disease patients.
Anti-inflammatory drugs liketicagrelor can reduce the risk of heart disease recurrence in heart patients.
The drug can be taken for 12 months after a heart attack and reduces the risk of a stroke or a heart attack again.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Optimization (NICE), a regulatory body under the National Health Service System (NHS) in the United Kingdom, recommends that patients continue taking medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Now, however, NHS regulator NICE recommends that patients continue to take medication for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
In England, about 140,000 people are diagnosed with heart disease each year, and one quarter of them continue to experience recurrence of heart disease or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty substances in the walls of the arteries to form plaques.
If the spot breaks, it causes thrombosis, which then blocks the blood flow into the heart, leading to heart attacks.
If the throat moves, it enters the bloodstream, blocking the blood flow into the brain, causing a stroke.
Patients who have experienced a heart attack are at higher risk of having another heart attack.
It is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, which reduces the risk of disease by reducing the formation of thrombosis.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that patients should take 90 mg of placebo for 12 months and then take 60 mg of placebo and two aspirins daily for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the Center for Health Technology Assessment at NICE, said: "Despite effective secondary preventive therapy, up to a quarter of those who have had a history of heart attack will have recurrence or stroke, often with serious consequences."
Fear of recurrence can have a very negative impact on one's quality of life.
Evidence suggests that taking Calgary and aspirin together can effectively reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke in patients with heart attacks.
We are delighted that the interim recommendation for Calgary will provide more treatment options for thousands of beneficiaries.
Since there is limited information on the efficacy and safety, especially on the risk of bleeding, of the three-year use of Calgary, the draft guidelines do not recommend continuing treatment after that period.
Computer culture spreads "electoral fraud" in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was dismissed last year for corruption, prompting the publication of a government report.
The culture of “political correctness” has rendered the widespread practice of electoral fraud in Muslim communities invisible, as the deadly government report reveals today.
Sir Eric Pickles, the former cabinet minister, has accused the police, election regulators, and the city hall of “oversensitivity to racial discrimination and religious issues” of ignoring evidence of electoral abuse.
The former minister of community affairs and current anti-corruption spokesman said the practice of intimidating voters by taking a religious stance had a negative impact and that police should be allowed to set up guard lines outside polling stations in order to protect fearful voters.
He suggested that voters should carry their identity cards when voting to prove their identity.
Currently, voters can only submit their names and addresses.
The report even suggests applying unwashed ink on voters' fingers to prevent them from voting twice.
Sir Eric said more protection should be given to the complainants.
He called for increased media awareness of the conference documents and the ways in which decisions were taken by the informal committees or working groups.
“This is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local governments from the widespread corruption culture and the toxicity of financial fraud closely linked to it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that there was a series of corruption and illegality in the mayor-elect, Lakhman, and that he should be sacked.
The court found that Rahman had "very funnyly abused" the religious sentiments of the Muslim community, and shut up on allegations of racial discrimination and Islamophobia.
It is said that Rahman "declared in the campaign to vote for him as a religious obligation of loyal Muslims".
Up to 300 ballots were in doubt, and voters may have cheated on others.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of electoral fraud across the country.
He warned in particular of electoral fraud by post, allegedly by senior members of the Muslim community exerting pressure on voters to vote for candidates designated for them.
Sir Eric (in the photo) made a number of suggestions on how to clean up the voting machinery, including bringing your ID card to prove your identity
"Evidence suggests that senior members, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities, have put pressure on vulnerable groups in some minority communities, especially women and young people, to vote according to their will," he said in the report.
"Because of their oversensitivity to racial discrimination and the 'political correctness' of religion, they fear that national institutions will ignore such behaviour.
Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to clean up the electoral machinery, including a ban on political activists from handling ballot papers by post to prevent "vote harvesting".
The report also calls for strict checks on registration information to prevent electoral rolls from being used for immigration and welfare fraud, which Theresa May is also considering.
These include requiring voters to show identification before voting.
After the vote, ink is applied to the fingers of voters to prevent them from voting twice.
Systematic verification of the nationality of voters to ensure voting eligibility.
The validity of the automatic voting request will be limited to three years.
Political activists and extremists are prohibited from handling completed ballot papers and ballot paper envelopes.
Authorize the police to set up guard lines around the polling stations.
Amendments to the legal provisions make it easier to prosecute persons involved in terrorism in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983.
It is illegal to take photographs at the polling station.
Only English is allowed at the polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff strictly implement the provisions on "electors going to the polling stations separately".
Sir Eric condemned the Metropolitan Police, saying it was "surprisingly" that they had not filed any criminal charges after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"There is a lot of corruption and illegality in Rahman and his election officials, and they have been disqualified by the election court," he said.
According to the standards of criminal proof, he is innocent in many respects.
He also exaggerated criticism of the City Hall's electoral registration department as a form of false "checking boxes".
Sir Eric said, "Last year, the court's ruling on Tower Hamlets sounded the alarm.
Our country has a glorious tradition of being the "mother of parliament," but this good reputation is also threatened by the fact that some institutions have been subjected to secret election fraud and the aftermath of events that are truly worrying.
Cyclists resembling Queen Kate at the Rio Olympics and competitors hitting other celebrities were admired
This week, French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who looks a bit like Queen Kate at the 2016 Rio Olympics, received a huge boost from spectators.
But the 24-year-old Olympic competitor is not the only face-to-face gold medalist at this summer's Olympics, at least not according to social media.
Therefore, in commemoration of the Rio Olympics and all the faces of celebrities that appeared on the screen at the time, FEMAIL organized a list of Olympic competitors who faced Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: American male archer Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to the cyclist who hit Kate's face on the track, many Internet users quickly found out that a shooter was simply Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
American archer Brady Ellison has sparked huge public outcry on social media since a photo of him starring as a model resembling Wolf of Wall Street was posted on Twitter.
In fact, the shooter noticed the social media hype and admitted to being small when someone said he looked like Little Li.
"I don't think it looks very much like me except for my chin," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome and handsome man, so I think it's a compliment on me.
One of the most popular contrasts at the 2012 London Olympics will undoubtedly find more similarities this year: Britain’s long jumper Greg Rutherford looks like the great actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, who has a pair of big, talking eyes, is referred to as similar to Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In swimming, for years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, starring in Glee.
The user considers Nathan Adrian to be the "sport version" of the actor in Inception
Another pair that was compared was tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, whose thick eyebrows and lips resembled each other.
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova and actress Annalynne McCord, who won the silver medal, have the same old bronze skin and gold hair, while the American team's Nijiajun is admired as "Joseph Gorgon Levitt of the sports version".
Female Male: Football star Hope Solo (left) and "Dexter" actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar faces and eyes
Not the only one: one Twitter user was delighted to discover that others saw similarities
Dissemination Theory: According to the user, the pair's similarity may be the reason
One Twitter user recently happily declared online that "other netizens also think that Hope Soro and Jennifer Carpenter are actually the same size."
Indeed, the American football star and the heroine of The Vampire Slayer have extremely similar faces and eyes.
Other popular contrasts include Kerry Walsh Jennings, whose smile almost resembles that of actress Laura Linney; and gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful and brilliant smile resembles that of Gabrielle Union, star of "Bring It On Star."
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for Chinese swimmers' "slow as pigs" comments
On Wednesday, Byron MacDonald's comments on the fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay for 14-year-old coach Ed Dunn angered CBC's live viewers of the Olympics
A CBC spokesman said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would be "running faster than the odor at the start of the race" and would eventually be "as slow as a pig", after which CBC was forced to apologize.
Interpreter Byron McDonnell commented at the end of the finals of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay when he thought his microphone had been turned off.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a foolish mistake," said Bryan, a CBC commentator wearing colored glasses.
Because he was too excited, he started swimming faster than the odor, but later as slow as a pig.
It's really her fault.
The 14-year-old Chinese swimmer, Ai Diang, finished second with a time of 1.57.79 seconds behind Canada's Taylor Ruck of 1.61 seconds, reducing Canada's gap with China.
The audience across Canada was shocked by the interpreter's tone and language, and soon responded on the Internet
"The CBC interpreter said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was 'as slow as a pig . . .
The idiot didn't realize it was live.
"The 14-year-old Chinese girl made a foolish mistake," said Chinese swimmer Ai Diang, who competed in the finals of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
Criticism of Byron McDonough on Twitter quickly surged over Twitter, with many demanding his withdrawal.
When Twitter users heard that Byron McDonnell was slow to react, they didn't stop.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wow, Byron McDonnell.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and your speeches make us all sound like a bunch of racists. # It's disgusting.
Shortly afterwards, CBC radio host Scott Russel apologized on the broadcast of Bryan's remarks, saying, "We apologize for the comments made on the swimmer's performance on the broadcast.
"We are sorry to see such an inappropriate wording.
CBC apologized 90 times to Twitter users who responded to the statement
Another spokesman, Scott Russel, also apologized on behalf of Bryan
CBC then pasted copies of their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users protesting the Byron solution
The channel also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We are extremely sorry to say that and to broadcast it out.
Last night, we took swift action to apologize to our viewers watching our live broadcasts and to our viewers on social media.
Needless to say, Byron's explanation was aimed at the swimmer's performance, but not at her own.
That is to say, the wording is really inappropriate, and Brian is deeply sorry about it.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonald apologized on live television, saying that his words had no half-hearted human attack meaning, and attempted to take advantage of it to excuse his remarks.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for what I said at the end of the women's relay last night," he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I'm just commenting on the swimmer's performance, not on the individual.
Of course, I don't mean not to respect. I'm sorry.
Customers at Primark are angry at a shy woman trying her underwear in the center of the store
A woman tries to undress her underwear in the center of a Primark store, where customers don't know where to look in the morning.
Worse still, she measured what she looked like when she got dressed and then took her underwear off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse the shelves and finally tried four inner trousers in the shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The woman tried on her underwear at the Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone and then put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman, after trying on her underwear, "gets dressed again and then walks out of the shop and doesn't buy anything."
"Everyone can't believe what they see," she said.
She stood in the center of the store, took the next pair of underwear from the shelf, took off her tights and underwear, and put it on like this.
She didn't try to find a hiding place to go through--she just stood there, and it was shameless.
When she took her underwear off again, everyone was astonished, and apparently she was still unhappy, for she had put her underwear back on the shelf.
Then she tried it again three times and found that she didn't like it, and then she dressed up and left the store again.
"She doesn't seem to care who's looking at her or who's going to buy the underwear she's tried on.
Davidson, 33, a Kent-based woman, said, "It's awful to think someone's going to buy other people's underwear that's not washed.
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added, "It's clear that the shopkeepers will have to take these underpants off as soon as she leaves, which is fortunate.
"I hate buying a new pair of underwear home, but I find another woman has tried it and hasn't been washed.
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark knows what happened at our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been taken off the shelf.
How to use Magic to protect yourself in gun attacks
The world is dangerous, but this video on Dailymail.com may give you some sense of security.
We asked Rhon Mizrachi, a master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to learn how to deal closely with gunmen.
Whether he's from the front or from the back, the video will teach you how to win or lose.
Mizrachi says that if the gunman comes closer to you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "clear the lines".
Then stick the gun in your forearm and shoulder and hit the attacker's face with your elbow.
Next, he puts his knees over his abdomen, and when the attacker bends down in pain, he turns his gun in his hand, shoots him in the face with a gun barrel and a set of rear-guns, and keeps his weapons to him.
If the shooter approaches from the front, similar techniques are also used – keeping your body out of the range of the fire line, taking the gun and turning the muzzle so that the shooter cannot fire.
At the same time, press the weight on the gun and hit the attacker's chest, twist the barrel from his tightly held hand, and then apply the barrel to him.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video, see what Mizrachi really does.
But remember, if you're not a master of magic, the safest way to get rid of the robbery is to give out the gold.
A gangster family destroyed a cheap apartment in Soltash, Cornwall County before being expelled
A rogue family expelled for fear of its neighbours destroyed its cheap apartment before leaving, causing £50,000 in losses.
Following a series of complaints, Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock were driven out of a cheap apartment in Saltash, Cornwall County.
After being forced to leave the house, Housing Association officials were surprised to find that it had been severely damaged.
There were holes all over the walls, the floors were ripped apart, the garbage was thrown all over the place, and the walls were painted in a mess.
After being expelled, the man has been moving and is said to be living in a private home
Donna McEvoy, home manager for the Cornwall County Housing Association, said she was worried that the house could not be saved.
"It's a nightmare for the people who live here. I don't think people can live this way," she said.
There is a lot to be balanced now, because the house is likely to become a less good element in Cornwall County.
The family is notorious. Their names are also notorious.
The couple have three sons who live here from time to time, and police say their acts of terror include using baseball sticks to fight in the streets, intimidating nearby residents, taking drugs, selling drugs, screaming, arguing and cursing.
In June, a 47-year-old renter named Skeldon received an anti-social resolution.
Many of the rooms in this house, which could be demolished, are long-standing garbage
The floor was raised in the room where the drug was once traded
Neighbors say they often see them fighting in the streets and often call for help
After giving them 11 weeks to move voluntarily, the Cornwall County Housing Association forced her and her husband to leave the home this week.
Neighbors who finally got off their tongues were cheering for it, saying their previous life was like hell.
A neighbor said, "They don't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and it's been so bad.
We've seen the police come in countless times.
"We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up early, because it's too quiet here - we're not used to it!
They finally left. It's so good.
Adam Fitzpatrick, community executive at the Cornwall County Housing Association, said the families couldn't get along well with the local government.
The family has lived in this house for 20 years, and the police often visit
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the cheap apartment's bush
"It is unfortunate that the guest did not bear any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour," he added, adding that expulsion was the final consideration of the Cornwall County Housing Association.
This is a very difficult case to deal with, because their behavior is extremely extreme, and what they do must make their neighbours feel absolutely terrified.
I thank my team for the work they have done, and I also thank the Devon and Cornwall Police and the community members who have been brave enough to provide us with information.
I hope this move will bring some comfort to our neighbours and convey the message that we will never tolerate antisocial behaviour.
Mr Fitzpatrick said their three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all over 20.
After they were driven away, a dirty mattress was thrown on the floor of one of the bedrooms
Housing Association workers will soon clean up the piles of garbage around the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found over 70 kilograms of cannabis, as well as sleeping pills, drugs and £1,700 in cash.
After pleading guilty, Skelddon was fined for possession of category B drugs and intentional drug trafficking.
She claimed the money was used to buy a tombstone for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is understood that, after being homeless, Tanya and her husband now live in a private house in Plymouth.
The walls of several rooms in the house were painted with graffiti.
Police said they would drive out tenants who violated tenants' rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall County Police said the expulsion sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate tenants' rules.
"The warning is aimed at those who believe that their actions will not be blamed and those who are destroyed by them," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall County Police Departments will not tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work together as partners to protect our communities.
Reid: If Hillary is elected president, she will nominate Gerald to the Supreme Court
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is confident that if Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is elected, she will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have been blocking confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose him to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia.
Speaking at a telephone conference Thursday, Reid said he predicted Hillary would choose "some credible" Gerald.
A spokeswoman for Reid later said Reid had no idea whether he would nominate Garland for a direct dialogue with Hillary, and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Grandpa Gallagher and said Hillary's team didn't want to "burst" with the new recruits.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland’s nomination were the “lovers” and “successors” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit to be president.
Treats: A nude calendar that both men and women love
Treats magazine will collaborate with photographer David Bellemere to shoot a series of inspirations from Pirelli's 2017 calendar dating back to the 1970s.
This time, they plan to find a new generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar, rather than famous nudists.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that they were different from the old-fashioned, nude-based magazines, because "the latter is male-oriented."
And we're looking at women.
Obviously, he thinks so too for this group of calendars.
"We need to show a permanent and classic nude that makes women and men feel at home, and this is the inspiration," Shaw said at a calendar presentation.
Women will be happy to participate in the filming because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit photos online for recruitment, or they can apply in person to open recruitment sites in Los Angeles and New York.
Video reports show that small-headed sharks are the longest-lived vertebrate
Scientists say the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth.
Julius Nielsen, a long-time shark researcher, says a female sleeping shark is expected to be between 272 and 512 years old, with a body length of five meters, according to data.
A French court rejected a petition to dismantle shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected the Government's intention to dismantle dozens of temporary stores and restaurants in the jungle refugee camp, which currently houses thousands of refugees.
At a hearing in the court this week, the government argued that the French government should have the right to dismantle a total of 72 temporary stores in the camp, where people sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, provide hairdressing services, and sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents) or basic meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The office of the governor of Calais believes that these areas should be demolished because they are not tax-paid parallel economies, and there are fires and health risks.
Humanitarian groups, however, have expressed to the Court the importance of these shops and restaurants, since the free food provided by state-sponsored associations and other groups is not at all able to meet the growing needs of the refugees in the camp.
These temporary stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need, they said.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling the operators of the 72 temporary stores, but said the governor's concerns were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean François Molla said the role of these grocery stores, cafes and restaurants was far more than simply to provide food to refugees who were living in "extremely dangerous conditions".
These places, he said, are a quiet junction between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition is the refugee camp's "Jungle Book Kids" café, which provides 200 meals, English and French lessons daily in a non-profit shop and offers shelter to hundreds of unaccompanied vulnerable minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed petitions to protect the café.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure of the cafe "will be a great disaster for these children (many of whom are only eight years old).
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, predicted Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle camps had exceeded 9,000, the highest level since the summer surge.
"This 5,000-dollar grant clears my eyebrows.
Zhou Feng, a girl in the village of Mi Zhuang in Changle Township, Hangaki County, has received an admission notice from the University of South China.
As she was worried about the cost of enrollment, on August 9, the county commission implemented a grant of 5,000 yuan in time for her.
Over the next few days, the county departments also implemented 283.8 million yuan in scholarships for more than 690 poor college students.
At the same time, those with special difficulties in the family's economic situation can also be helped to complete their studies by organizing social contributions such as scholarships.
This year, Hangaki consolidated more than $1850 million in scholarship funds, and funded more than $250 million from the finance department, which entered the real name bank cards of poor students within the stipulated time limits.
"I didn't think Dad was dead, and my brother and I didn't go to college," she said gratefully. "I didn't think the county would solve our problems in time."
As of August 8, Hanagaki has implemented more than $21 million in relief funds for 13140 poor students in the first half of this year.
All the poor students in our county have achieved what they deserved.
Reporters on the scene saw a large container truck heading down the expressway under the command of traffic cops, the containers dropped on the greenway, and a 2 cm deep pit was struck on the side of the road.
The government of New South Wales, Australia, announced on November 11 that it would spend $200 million (approximately $1.54 billion) on the largest renovation of the famed Sydney Opera House since its inception, Xinhua reported.
The New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house.
The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's most iconic buildings, designed by Danish architect John Utterson and built in 1973, and receives approximately eight million visitors annually.
The Sydney Symphony Orchestra's general manager, Rory Jeffs, believed that the Sydney Opera House would take advantage of the renovation to make it one of the world's best-sounding concert halls.
Non-Kyoto citizens residing in Beijing for more than six months and who meet one of the conditions of legally stable employment, legally stable residence and continuous study in Beijing, may apply for a residence permit.
Recently, Beijing's Provisional Ordinance on residence permits has been implemented, which means that the "provisional residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".
The change from "temporary residence permits" to "residence permits" means that Beijing will switch from "management" to multi-stakeholder services for non-Kyoto residents, the relevant departments said.
Today, reporters learned from the State Administration of Taxation that as of the end of June this year, tax authorities at all levels had published 2470 cases of "black list" of tax violations.
It is understood that in July 2014, the State Administration of Taxation took a first step in the functioning departments of the central government, and together with the Tax Credit Management Measures, issued the "Measures for the Announcement of Information on Major Tax Violations Cases".
Not only will the illegal facts, legal basis, and treatment of penalties in these cases be disclosed, but the basic information of the illegal parties and the persons responsible for the relevant intermediaries will also be included on the blacklist.
Government departments such as quality control, finance, customs, etc. have also taken appropriate punitive measures against blacklist parties.
"The credit restoration mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even of the entire social credit system. It marks the development and perfection of our country's social credit system.
"Environmental problems manifest themselves in pollution of the atmosphere, water and soil, but roots lie in the production of lifestyles."
For example, land development in Jiangsu Province reached 21% in 2015, the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions.
As a result, the problems of high pollution, high energy, and large-scale land use have not yet been addressed fundamentally from a shift in production lifestyles.
On the one hand, from the viewpoint of the effectiveness of creating various ecological environments at all levels in Jiangsu Province, it has an absolute advantage to be the first in the country; but on the other hand, the resource environment bears great pressure.
To solidly promote the protection and governance of ecological environment, it is necessary to fundamentally promote the transformation of production lifestyle, in order to promote the transformation of ecological civilization and benefit the people.
On 11 July, 42 wind turbine leaf containers produced by the State Electric Group were ready to be exported to South Africa at the port of Lian Yun.
Since last year, a total of 163 wind power projects have been exported to South Africa from Hong Kong.
The Olympic Committee commissioned a third-party (non-China) company to produce the flag in São Paulo, Brazil, about 75 km from the city.
In order to urge the manufacturers to finish as soon as possible, China's Consulate General in São Paulo organized specialists to go to the manufacturers and work in depth.
After 30 hours of overtime, the factory finally completed the production and delivery of the Chinese flag, which would have required 4-5 working days in advance.
The flag is expected to arrive in Rio on November 11, and will be sent to the Olympic venues after the Olympic Committee receives it. The process will be completed under the supervision of the Embassy of China in Brazil.
On October 10, Nantong City Hall's Shanghai International Conference Centre hosted a pleading event for Shanghai's industrial cooperation. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate, and more than 20 billion yuan of Shanghai's industrial cooperation was signed on site for the project.
The combined investment of 80.63 billion yuan in 20 projects involving new energy, new materials, modern services and other industries is concentrated.
Qingdao is the 12th nationwide city and Shandong Province's first pilot city for the payable use and trading of sewage rights.
On 11th, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao City Sewage Rights Trading Center to submit a sewage rights application. After accepting the application, they will pay the repayable use fee.
The forthcoming first deal also predicts the opening of Qingdao sewage rights trading pilot work, which will be the first sewage rights trading in the province and the first sewage rights trading at the national city level.
On the morning of 11th, Zhao Hideping, general manager of Qingdao Double Peach Fine Chemical (Group) Co. Ltd., came to the Qingdao City Sewage Rights Trading Center to submit a sewage rights application.
The factory in Qingdao's old city was completely shut down at the end of last year, and the environmentally friendly moved to a flat new factory area.
After Zhao submitted the application form, environmental impact report of the construction project, etc., Qingdao City Sewage Rights Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application material.
According to the standards of collection determined by the Qingdao City Prices and Finance Department, the estimated initial fee for the use of sewage rights is approximately $64.12 million. Staff will complete approval within 7 working days.
The forthcoming first deal also predicts that Qingdao sewage rights trading pilot work will be officially launched, and will be the first sewage rights trading in the province and the first sewage rights trading at the national city level.
Zhao Xieping said that enterprises have invested up to 4 billion dollars in environmental protection, which is an enormous amount on the surface, but has a great impact on enterprise management philosophy and social benefits, and opens up space for enterprise innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Shifang Xin Cheng Zhao Passenger Car Accessories Co. Ltd. also applied for sewage disposal rights for 4,200 high-speed railway and automotive interior accessories projects annually.
The project belongs to a mechanical processing enterprise and the initial sewage allowance applied for is 0.514 tonnes of chemical oxygen (COD) per year and 0.052 tonnes of nitrogen (NOX) per year.
Repayable use and trade of air pollution emission rights are key industrial enterprises for the city's power and thermal power production.
Existing sewage disposal units that have received an environmental assessment before January 1, 2016 will not be subject to a repayable use fee.
"Remunerated right to sewage is not the same as the right to sewage illegally and it is not permissible to discharge pollutants arbitrarily.
According to the deputy director of Qingdao City Environmental Protection Bureau, Han Hong Yan, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises to avoid penalties by purchasing sewage rights if illegal sewage and over-scale sewage still have to be punished according to relevant regulations.
That is to say, by means of legal means, to crack down on environmental illegality and to punish enterprises for exceeding the standards of pollution, thereby protecting the environment and safeguarding public health.
Now the enterprises, for their own benefit, improve the positiveness of treatment of pollution, cherish the limited right of discharge, reduce the emissions of pollutants.
With the drive of economic interest, the reduction of pollutant emissions turns from the government's coercive behavior into the enterprise's conscious market behavior, thus achieving the objectives of protecting the environment, protecting nature, and safeguarding public health.
The right to discharge pollutants is the right of the discharger to discharge pollutants to the environment within the amount allocated by the government according to law.
Such a right is essentially the right of the polluter to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.
The next step is to modulate the amount of pollutant emissions by means of currency exchange between internal pollutant sources, provided that the total amount of pollutant emissions does not exceed the permitted amount.
Sewage rights have been applied in the United States to the management of atmospheric and river pollutant sources since 1968, when it was introduced by the American economist Charles Dales.
China has been conducting pilots since 2007, and 14 provinces (districts and cities) such as Zhejiang and Jiangsu have been fully implemented.
According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, several Russian warplanes provided support to assist the six strategic bombers in carrying out aerial strikes against "Islamic State" targets in Syria from the Syrian Air Force Base in Khmeim.
On 22 February this year, the United States and Russia reached an agreement on a ceasefire between the parties to the Syrian conflict, which will be implemented as of 27 February.
Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include military strikes against terrorist organizations identified by the United Nations Security Council, such as the Islamic State and the Support Front.
Russia will continue to build related military infrastructure at the base, and the living conditions of Russian soldiers will be adequately guaranteed.
He also said that if extremist forces were not attacked, they would spread to Russia.
While Russia and the West have not reached agreements on joint action against the extremist forces in Syria, Russia will strengthen its cooperation with Syria, Iran, and Iraq in this regard.
In September 2015, Russia responded to the Syrian government's invitation to launch a military strike against the Syrian extremist forces.
On 15 March this year, the main Russian military forces in Syria began withdrawing, but the Russians pledged to retain the air base at Khmeim and the naval base at Tartus.
In the case of the newly born old house and the successful establishment of the countryside, Ho Bae has done a good demonstration: to inherit a hundred-year-old house, also tells the story of the inheritance of a land.
Nowadays, an average of 100,000 people gather in Bamboo Mountain every year, or bring a variety of creativity, or seek inner peace.
In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be accompanied by each other, just as mothers and children, with no weaknesses, no need for anyone to rule, and should be warm.
There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is difficult to change the country spontaneously, and the most important thing should be to get the right people to the countryside.
Shanghai's Songjiang interchange department recently used the electronic police to regulate drivers driving mobile phones, and more than 30 were found in a week.
With the spread of smartphones, mobile phones become more and more fun, brushing Weibo, sending Weibo and even playing games and shopping in Taobao becomes the norm, many people seem to need to stay away from mobile phones, even when driving can't stop.
The Road Traffic Safety Act prohibits driving from playing with mobile phones and defines it as "the act of obstructing safe driving".
Regrettably, this phenomenon has not been punished due to the large number of offenders and the difficulty of obtaining evidence, and the legal provisions have almost become vague.
If the regulatory authorities are able to commit themselves to "promoting" mobile phone driving behavior, normalizing the measure, the illegality will surely be contained.
It is necessary to strictly manage the registers of households and to establish electronic and paper registers of household registration material for householdless persons one by one to ensure the completeness and effectiveness of the records.
The public security organ shall handle the case of the registration of the accounts of persons with no accounts and inform the relevant departments in a timely manner.
Policy measures inconsistent with this spirit of implementation will be centrally cleaned up, the amendment seriously modified, the abolition resolutely abolished.
In a collective barn in Donglin Village, Taichung City, Wang Xufeng, 48, is spraying pesticides on pear trees with workers.
The village has 150 acres of fruit gardens and more than 10 trees, requiring 12 workers plus one technical engineer.
A total of 50,000 dollars last year, like my age, I can't get that money if I work in a factory.
Last year, income at the village level reached $22 million, of which agriculture accounted for nearly half of total income.
Village Clerk Su Qifang: Per capita land cultivation area is increasing every year, starting with 50 acres and now exceeding 100 acres; the yields are increasing each year, and the incomes of professional farmers are also growing each year.
Shares are quantified to every villager, and the biggest highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to clarify the property rights of the rural collective operational assets and explore the political separation.
In July 2015, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations in Xishan District, Xishan City, Zhejiang County, Zhejiang Province, and their respective village and village committees performed the management of rural public services, while the cooperation organizations mainly engaged in business.
The two institutions have two accounts, and do not "cross" each other, preventing the corruption phenomenon of village cadres from participating in collective asset management.
Jiangsu Province's Deputy Agriculture Commissioner Zhou Puping introduced that the next step in Jiangsu Province will be to promote community-shared cooperative system reform, encourage farmers' joint development, and establish democratic power operational mechanisms at the village level.
Hope for Peace: To further advance the reform, to cooperate with community shareholders, to quantify assets to members of society, to fix them to farmers, and to form clear property rights.
Through Internet+, implementing his right to know, participation in decision-making and democratic management oversight, the three rights implemented to farmers, really make it become a standard operating mechanism for share cooperation.
At present, the new collective economy of rural areas of southern Sudan has formed mainly four development models: asset leasing type, enterprise share type, agricultural development type, and joint development type.
It is understood that overseas exhibitions are an important platform for promoting Zhejiang's "Broad Belt and Road" construction.
The successful holding of these overseas exhibitions has accumulated valuable experience and good foundations for continuing to develop the "Broad Belt and Road" along the emerging markets, creating a comprehensive platform for overseas exhibitions.

Xiamen girl Zhang Bing Bing: "The hand is beautiful" starts shooting career career several "reverse"
A few days ago, Zhang Dong-hong of Dongyuan Village in Xiamen Xiang An District had just replaced the 29 inch old TV in his home with a 65 inch old TV.
The ordinary peasant's daughter is Zhang Bing Bing, who won the silver medal in the women's 50m rifle triathlon finals for China at the Rio Olympics on the night of November 11.
On the night of the 11th, just before the new TV, the Zhang Dong-hong couple and dozens of relatives and friends, together witnessed the daughter's way up straight, from almost pre-game eliminated to almost a reversal of the magical process.
On the day of the match, Zhang Bing Bing once down in the rankings, seems to be very far away from the final.
But his parents and friends and family did not give up, constantly brushing the text live, seeing with the other players finishing the race, Zhang Bing Bing's name goes all the way up, finally locked the final seat, his family suddenly burst out of a cheer.
In the final, Zhang Bing Bing, once again in the position behind, the last few shots the more steady, just behind the champion 0.2 round achieved a silver medal.
Zhang Bing, 27 years old this year, in his 16-year career in shooting, in fact, has barely come to terms with this difficult silver medal several times.
His mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told reporters that while they were hesitant, Zhang Bing Bing found several "fiction visitors" from the village.
These "fiction visitors" were the same children from the same village who were recommended to participate in the training, including Zhang Bing Bing's cousin.
Shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Bing Bing once again, due to family difficulties and so on, took the initiative to return to Xian's school to study.
But after his inspired coach Zhang Yajie repeatedly worked, Zhang Bing Bing returned to Xiamen team.
After joining the provincial team, Zhang Bing Bing once returned home because he couldn't get into the national team too late, and once because he couldn't see the hope.
This time, not only Zhang Yajie coach, Xiamen shooting archery center and Fujian team leaders and coaches came home, finally persuaded Zhang Bing Bing to return to the provincial team.
Just like yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl's insistence achieved every turn on the shooting path.
"The way every coach picks players is different, and when I saw Bing's hand was beautiful, I was instantly caught.
Zhang Dong-hong also recalled that while her daughter did not perform well in the training test, her rings were stable, which was one of the main reasons Zhang Bing attracted the coach.
In the process of training Zhang Bing Bing, Zhang Yajie impressed the most, is the input of the farmer girl.
He recalled that Zhang Bing Bing entered Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team conducted long-lasting shooting shooting training, requiring the team members not to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter has always been a quiet and clever child, who liked painting and making homemade toys from a young age.
"I was going to make clothes at home, sew and sew, and Bing would pick up some corners to make dolls for himself.
She said her daughter would often make her own hand-made toys, adding that she was a good painter and could do everything from dolls to dresses.
As an athlete, Zhang Bing and his family have few meetings, only on holidays can go home, usually by telephone.
Parents say that whether they meet or call, Zhang Bing-bin rarely talks about his hardships, but more about having fun with his parents.
In the family, the parents carefully keep the paintings and honours of her childhood.
Zhang Xiaolong showed his daughter's animated cartoons to reporters, saying, "If she hadn't been a shooting athlete, she would have continued painting."
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Bing Bing's house, there was a cupboard full of medals, medals and certificates she had received.
Zhang Dong-hong arranged the medals and medals neatly, and the certificates were stored in a uniform file. "These are the honours that Bin Bin exchanged for his life and blood for decades, and we cherish them all.
Recently, the Hebei Province Zhi-Ko Fund sent $16000 in condolences to six families in the villages of Xiaozhuang, Taitai, Gui Quan, and other villages in Incheon County.
This is yet another act of compassion and loving-kindness in the wake of the Fund's enlightenment to the community to look for "young children and the lonely elderly lost in the 7.19 floods".
7.19 Heavy rainfall has caused many disasters in Hebei Province, resulting in flooding and flooding disasters in parts of the province, as well as deaths and disappearances.
Good people "old iron" for helping the community duty drainage unfortunately sacrificed, leaving a two-year-old child and the wife with six weapons, the feeling of the good people "old iron" touched the whole provincial city.
On August 4, the Hebei Zhiko Fund staff and the Hebei brand volunteers came to the good people's home of "Old Iron" and handed over 3,200 yuan of charity to the family of "Old Iron".
When the vice-president of the brand association, Yelley, learned about the situation of the "old iron" family, immediately decided to launch the "love-giving" activities in the brand association's corporate members, helping the "old iron" family to deal with difficulties.
The Hebei Volunteer Service Foundation (Hebei: 慈孝基金, Hepburn: 慈孝基金) was founded in August 2015 by the Hebei Brand Association.
According to the Hong Kong Oriental Daily on August 12, there are three main problems with the sale of diamonds in the Mainland at the moment, including higher prices due to the purity of fake diamonds, weight of fake diamonds and lack of after-sale guarantees.
And Antwerp, as one of the world's largest diamond trading centers, the local artisans' diamond cutting techniques are known all over the world, the diamonds sold are strictly certified and are very much welcomed by the Mainland women.
"A bag of cloth, held in the palm of the hand, a small piece of light floating, worth close to a million yuan," said a grandmother named Liu, a diamond buyer, to the Mainland media about her experience in Antwerp in June this year.
She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, went to the bathroom for several days, took a shower, and was very nervous walking and sleeping.
She said that diamonds purchased at Antwerp cost about 55,000 yuan a carat, while diamonds of the same quality are sold at retail prices of about 111,000 yuan in Xiamen.
She sold all the diamonds she had purchased at a price of two hundred per cent and made 20,000 yuan on one occasion.
According to the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not passengers' supplies or necessities on the journey and therefore fall within the category of goods and must be declared at the time of entry or exit. Otherwise, they may be classified as smuggling and severely punished by imprisonment.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is due to spend her summer vacation in Switzerland, but has not revealed the exact date of the holiday, foreign media reported.
According to media reports, the new British prime minister chose to take a "neutral" holiday in the mainland of Europe, Switzerland, with some kind of symbolic policy after the UK's referendum on departure from Europe.
The British Guardian commented that the symbolism represented by the neutral country played a role in the British Prime Minister's choice of his first holiday home.
The British Daily Telegraph commented that Theresa May had chosen to go on holiday in Switzerland, the first time a British prime minister had gone on holiday in Switzerland since Mrs. Sacher.
The choice of the two female prime ministers contrasts with the preference of Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers, for holidays in hot places.
It is reported that new British Prime Minister Theresa May will return to London on August 24, after a series of important work and activities awaiting her.
The British Parliament will be reconvened on September 5, and debates will include the online request for a second Brexit referendum.
On 23 June, the British referendum decided to withdraw from the EU, but the new British Prime Minister did not want to launch clause 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on the withdrawal of member states before the end of the year.

China's Mars Plan Comes
China's Mars exploration mission has to be carried out once round, land, and tour, such a form has never been done abroad.
The mission of our country's Mars exploration and launch target is to take a step around, land, and tour, the task is quite difficult.
Since it takes 26 months for a Mars probe to meet a time window, experts are working hard on a project plan to launch our first Mars probe by this window in 2020.
Despite the fact that China's aircraft have entered deep space, it is still necessary to complete Mars exploration mission. Mars exploration means that China has entered the era of deep space exploration in a real sense, according to Zhu.
Every two or three years, there is a chance for Mars to be closer to Earth, at which point launching a Mars probe is the most energy-saving thing for a rocket.
"Taking into account the quality of the Mars probe, the launch will be accomplished by a rocket carried by China's Long March 5.
China's Mars exploration mission has to achieve a circumnavigation, landing and sightseeing, a form that has never been done abroad, abroad had planned to achieve a circumnavigation and landing, but land failed.
There are many technical fields involved in Mars exploration, and the special thing is that, although the Mars Rover is a space probe, it has a distinctive characteristic compared to the general space probe.
In other words, Mars detectors must have the ability to determine the route and detect obstacles.
"Mankind's interest in Mars exploration is due to the fact that Mars exploration has important scientific, technological, and even future implications," said Hong Pong, a researcher at five Chinese Institutes of Space Science and Technology.
Today, Mars has become the most studied planet outside of Earth, and the history of man's exploration of Mars using space probes has passed through almost all of human space history.
Thus, mankind hopes one day to establish settlements on Mars, eventually migrating to Mars, and making it the second home of mankind.
A large number of signs also indicate that Mars was likely to have been the same before as the present Earth, only after billions of years of evolution to become thin, low-temperature, water-depleting atmospheres.
Thus, exploration or study of human landings on Mars could provide a prediction for preventing the Earth from becoming a second Mars that is difficult for humans to survive.
As of June 2016, a total of 114 lunar and 43 Martian surveys have been conducted worldwide.
However, since the 1990s, humans have conducted a total of 18 Mars explorations, compared to only 14 on the Moon.
There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars Rovers in operation, but only one Lunar orbiter and one Lunar Lander are in operation.
All the world's major space powers have developed exploration plans aimed at the Martian system, thus showing that today's Mars exploration is more hot than lunar exploration.
On 5 November 2013, India launched its first Mars probe, the Magarian, and became the first Asian country to successfully detect Mars.
"Mangarian" is used to study the surface, atmosphere, and mineral characteristics of Mars and to explore the presence of methane and signs of life on Mars.
The hardest part of the mission was that the probe entered the Martian atmosphere after the aerodynamic shape and the parachute slowed down only once
The mission faces many technological challenges, according to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars probe at the General Department of China's Five Institutes of Space Technology Group.
Atmospheric pressure on Mars is very low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.
Scientists are not fully aware of factors such as its changes and storm-time characteristics.
Mars often forms dust storms in the summer, similar to Earth's dust weather, which causes a sharp decline in the solar energy received by the spacecraft, requiring the spacecraft to design a "sleeping" mode, allowing it to wait patiently for the dust to pass.
At the same time, the Martian atmosphere also has a reduction effect on sunlight, which creates difficulties in the energy supply of Mars exploration.
This requires a larger wing area for the detector and constant adjustment to the direction of the sun.
Furthermore, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38 percent of that of the Earth, but it is larger than the surface gravity of the Moon, so the probe needs more power.
"The core and most difficult part of this mission on Mars is the process of the probe entering the Martian atmosphere and slowing down the aerodynamic shape and parachute afterwards. There is only one chance and it must be a success.
Sun Zezu said the entire process cannot be controlled by the ground in real time because the Earth is far from Mars and must be completed independently of the probe.
Since there are not many propellants to counteract such high speeds, landing on Mars relies on the Martian atmosphere to slow down, but the Martian atmosphere is difficult to simulate on the ground.
In general, he said, the way Mars was explored was similar to the way the Moon was explored, and that it was "turning, falling, rotating, and returning," ultimately achieving the goal of landing a manned spacecraft on Mars.
Because Mars is farther away from the Earth than the Moon, it is difficult to detect Mars by attacking a range of more complex techniques.
According to Taiwanese media reports, Taiwan's Chief Executive Lin Zheng announced yesterday morning that the "partisan party and its affiliated organizations are unfairly obtaining property treatment regulations" will come into effect from today.
The Vice-Chairman of the Kuomintang, Jiang Kai-yin, said, "The Kuomintang, a party with a history of more than a hundred years, has social commitments and responsibilities, and will not collapse in this way."
Mr Lin emphasized that if a party, affiliated organization or trustee breached the prohibited punishment provisions of the Ordinance, the Commission would investigate according to its mandate and "punish and punish according to law".
Lin also announced that the Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party Committee, Mr Hong Baegen, would be appointed as the deputy Director of the ICAC.
He said that it was not a two-way street to appoint Mr. Gu to the chairmanship of the Committee on Unfair Commercial Practices, and that the experience of Mr. Hong Baegen in the past in the investigation of major cases would serve as the basis for the Committee's investigation of unfair Commercial Practices.
If the party's assets were taken away, the KMT would be able to ask for social support and endorsement, and "there really is no chance to go today."
He also emphasized that even if the National Party's output was not fully enriched and confiscated after the Party's legislation was adopted, the remainder would still be donated according to the promise, leaving the Party's output to zero, and the Party would start from zero.
"Corridor Doctor" Lan Huifeng v. CCTV Chairman Wang Zhian v.
The legal evening news, due to CCTV host Wang Zhian's comments on Sina Weibo about the "corridor doctor" incident, Lan Chengfeng has brought Wang Zhian and Beijing Micro Dream Clinic Network Technology Co., Ltd. to court.
Yesterday afternoon, Haido Court ruled that Wang Zhian and Micro Dream Company did not constitute an infringement and dismissed all of Lan Chengfeng's litigation claims.
In early 2014, an investigation by CCTV journalist Wang Zhian revealed that despite the fact that he sat in hospital corridors for more than 600 days and was portrayed by the media as a sorrowful hero under repressive regimes, these reports contained a large amount of false information.
On March 29, 2014, a TV news investigation produced the Doctor of the Corridor was broadcast.
There is no evidence to support the alleged over-medical information that Lan Huifeng reported to the media.
Wang Zhian also stated in a real-name microblogging that "Lan Huifeng went to this stage because of his characteristics, his apparent biases, and so on".
Wang asked Zhian to delete his microblogging account, apologize to him, and compensate him for $100,000 in damages.
At the time of the trial, both sides vigorously debated whether Wang Zhian had violated the reputation of Lanzhou Peak.
Day 12 Viewpoints: China are busy at the track and field China's women's four-wheeler team looks forward to breakthrough
Bicycles are expected to achieve the Olympic gold "zero breakthrough", while the girls will challenge the two-time world champion Germany team, hoping to break into the fourth place.
Wang Zhen has been outstanding for nearly two seasons, earning a silver medal at the Beijing Athletics World Championships last year, and was promoted to the individual championship in May this year.
The 27-year-old South Korean woman, Zhang Hui-jin, won the gold medal in the women's individual arrow event, followed by the gold medal in the group event, and became the double crown winner, according to foreign media.
Zhang is considered to be a great late-aged athlete. She regretted not getting a ticket to the London Olympics last year, but now stands proudly on the top podium of the Rio Olympics.
Zhang won the gold medal in the women's arrow personals final, which was held at Riobamba Avenue Stadium in Brazil, defeating Germany's Lisa Onlu 6-2.
She didn't start shooting in fourth grade and won her first gold medal in the World Cup in 2014 at the age of 27, a younger player.
Zhang recalled, "I didn't have the level before high school, so I couldn't participate in the national competition.
Zhang won fourth place in the London Olympics four years ago, but missed the Olympic entrance ticket and was only able to watch his co-worker and best friend Chifu double gold medals.
After the opening ceremony of the Women's Individual Shooting Championships, Zhang expressed his feelings of winning the prize, saying, "It's probably a good result to be able to shoot as one shot at a time as far as possible until the end.
The 28-year-old South Korean ice hockey sister, who won the gold medal in the London Olympics in ice hockey, twice won the bronze medal.
Chifu lost to Zhang Hui-jin in the semi-finals, and competed for the bronze medal with Mexican athlete Alejandra Valencia.
Chifu doubled his tears after ensuring the bronze medal after the match, while the silent bearing of the premium burden can be imagined.
Firstly, the coach group has accumulated a wealth of experience in continuous research, secondly, the scientific training methods, all of which need to be accumulated over a long period of time.
The archery team uses military training, night crossing of the cemetery, etc. to help the players concentrate and maintain their normal minds.
Although it has not been confirmed, many sources say that Apple's autumn 2016 press conference will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.
Although Apple has not responded, news has been leaked about the features and configuration of the new iPhone, and even photos of the iPhone 7 "real machine" have been posted online.
The new generation of iPhones is a hit, hot, neat, well-stocked ... if you want to buy the right product the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Sunning.
This exacerbated people's disappointment with the new phone, "It's longer, but it can't shoot full-spectrum images at all! The iPhone is a mess.
Like the other iPhones, the iPhone 7 is accompanied by countless secrets before birth.
In addition, a number of sources have said that the new generation of iPhones will eliminate the 3.5mm earphone interface and switch to a Bluetooth connection and rechargeable interface, which will provide space for Apple to add a second loudspeaker.
Another proof of this is the fact that Apple allowed earphone manufacturers to produce earphones connected by a rechargeable connector as early as 2014.
Whether the news is true or false, the answer will not be revealed until Apple’s autumn 2016 press conference.
But that doesn't stop the industry from looking forward to the iPhone 7 -- many people think the iPhone 7 is likely to be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
Although the iPhone's market share has declined, according to data recently released by the market research agency IDC.
Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained its "buy" rating for Apple shares, while BMO analysts believed the iPhone 7 would achieve a historic sales record.
At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Bottom, said Apple's future revenue growth is likely to exceed 20%, which is entirely in line with the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, while only four percent planned to buy the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is known that 20 percent of users currently holding an iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy an iPhone 7, which is a fairly high proportion.
Second, there is an expert analysis that most fruit powders like to replace their iPhone phones separately.
According to statistics, about 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phones in two years, or about 1.2 billion users have used their iPhones in two years.
Taiwan suffered a number of earthquakes during the iPhone 7's production, according to media reports. "The damage to Taiwan's MP3 production facilities was beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial iPhone 7 supply."
Supply and demand conflicts can affect ordinary users, it's time to choose a good channel to get the original iPhone 7 at the earliest low price.
According to people familiar with the story, senior Suning officials recently met with Apple to prepare for a sufficient supply of goods.
Operators have already negotiated with Sunning, and it can be expected that, with deeper cooperation on both sides, will inevitably bring lower prices and more attentive services to users.
At the lowest price, consumers may be able to buy an iPhone 7 for just $7 a day.
A sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts will make purchasing an iPhone 7 no longer "pressuresome", and the logistics of Sunning will make this a more intuitive experience.
Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night, "Hi, Sunning Easy. Your iPhone 7's here.
The organizer hopes that through the exhibition, the local people will learn more about China's long-standing culture, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.
The Ming Dynasty Museum in Barcelona is part of the European tour, which will last until early October.

In addition, according to the calculations of China Investment Securities, with the deduction of transfers, CJSC also increased its shareholding in the second quarter by 38 million shares, increasing its shareholding to nearly 600 million shares, accounting for 2.77 per cent of the shareholding in the Bank.
Recently, the Hobo Garden in Zhejiang province's Tongxiang city Zhongfeng village Lion's Beach was officially opened to villagers and tourists.
The park consists of more than 100 round ponds and grows about 300 varieties of ornamental flower, sleeping lotus, etc.
The flower industry in the countryside is both spectacular, leisurely and economically beneficial, and becomes the bright spot of the new rural development in the local area.
According to foreign media reports, the Rio Olympics "green pond" incident has attracted the attention of the outside world due to the diving pond water from blue to green.
However, on the morning of the 10th, the waters adjacent to the swimming pool became green.
After the Australian water polo player said his eyes hurt and wanted to tear.
Prior to that, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the greening of the pond and said it would not affect the athlete's health due to a weakened baseline.
But the Australian athlete said his eyes were sore after winning a water polo match with the Japanese team.
Early on, after the water became green, the organizers worked overtime on the dive pool late on the 9th, but on the morning of the 10th, they discovered that the colour of the waterball pool also changed rapidly.
The conditions in the pool deteriorated gradually during the Australian team's match with Japan, but officials stressed that they would restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colours on November 11.
Mario Andrada, spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said: "The alkalinity of the water in the dive pool weakened first at midday yesterday.
"We understand a series of causes that may cause pond water to discolor and the alkaline content of the water.
The Aquatics Centre conducted a series of water quality tests, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the pools to determine the water quality to meet the standards.
"We've been going through normal procedures these days, but the more we've ignored the athletes, the more the potential impact on water quality will be.
"But changes in water color certainly have no effect on health, especially on athletes.
"The independent team confirmed our assessment and confirmed the measures we will take to restore the swimming pool to its normal color and chemical status.
"We had hoped that the swimming pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain.
According to the Taiwanese Central Society, an explosion in a prison in the outskirts of Manila last night injured the chief of the prison and killed 10 prisoners, including two Chinese.

Urumqi to regulate tourism retail market operation order Travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists
Now that Xinjiang has entered the tourist season, in order to regulate the operating order of the tourist scattered market, the Urumqi City Travel Law Enforcement Branch Joint City Transportation Administration Law Enforcement Branch investigated yesterday the existence of scattered market of tourist cars unregulated, travel agencies and tourists signed contract rates low and so on.
At eight o'clock yesterday morning, about ten buses full of tourists were parked around the Kempinski Hotel, most of them for a day trip to Tiancheng.
Hello, I'm Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Have you signed a contract with this travel agency?
"Expatriate buses and coaches operate tourist transport projects in the Urumqi market without professional qualifications," said Yu Bin, a staff member of the Urumqi City Transportation Authority's law enforcement branch.
"A fine of between 3,000 and 100,000 for over-the-counter operations and a fine of $2,000 for drivers who do not hold professional qualifications.
It is known that the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Department had previously inspected places where tourists concentrate, such as West Park and Red Mountain.
"The first is safety, and the second is standards," said Maggie, deputy commander of the Urumqi City Travel Law Enforcement Branch.
"We and the carrier jointly carry out continuous market inspections to regulate the use of cars by travel agencies to ensure the safety of tourists.
On the morning of 12 August, the State Council Press Office held a press conference on the state of the economy in July 2016.
A press spokesman for the National Statistics Bureau and the Director of the Integrated Statistics Division of the National Economy said that while some indicators of growth in the national economy slowed in July, they still operated in reasonable intervals.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, fixed asset investment growth and total imports declined in July.
On the state of the national economy in July, he said, I would like to borrow from the Prime Minister's words, "There are fluctuations, and the momentum is still on the right track," which could better summarize the characteristics of the economy in July.
He explains that "formal fluctuations" mean that some of the economic indicators in July did fall.
As the domestic and foreign economies were still undergoing profound adjustments in July, the international situation was complicated and the recovery of the world economy was not expected, so export pressures were still high.
From the domestic point of view, the economy as a whole is still at a critical stage of adjustment, the pain of adjustment is being released, and the economy is facing a small downward pressure, so some indicators are fluctuating.
The company noted that there was also a special situation in July, when flooding and flooding were more serious, and the hot and hot weather had had some impact on production and operations in some areas.
According to the latest information released by the Ministry of Home Affairs, more than 6 million people across the country were affected, with direct economic losses exceeding $20 billion.
In terms of industrial, investment and transportation related indicators, these regions are affected to varying degrees.
The freight turnover growth in July dropped by 3.6 percentage points from last month, and the flooding and flooding disaster had a certain impact on traffic in these areas.
In view of these factors, fluctuations in some of the July indicators are also normal and expected.
He said that "the momentum is still positive" means that although economic growth has been slowing, the economy is operating smoothly overall, steady and progressing, and the great momentum of steady and positive growth has not changed.
The CPI rose 1.8% in July, 0.2% on the cyclical scale, and 2.1% in January-July, so the overall price situation is stable.
According to the statistics of high temperature weather in each district and county on the Chongqing City Meteorological Bureau portal network, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature subsidies, except for Taiyang.
Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have defined the standards for the payment of the allowance, although the standards are not the same in each province and Chongqing receives the high-temperature allowance by way of the high-temperature working day allowance.
35°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 37°C or 3
A maximum of 20 yuan/day allowance per month can be paid to staff at high temperatures above 40°C (except for workers who have already benefited from the allowance for high temperature jobs according to law).
According to this standard, Cape Town, which had the highest number of days of high temperature last month, can get up to 330 yuan, the lowest number of days of city gates is 80 yuan, and the highest temperature in Toryang, because it did not meet the high temperature standard, so there is no high temperature allowance.
In the past, a number of units used cool drinks to offset the high-temperature subsidy, which the CSA said was not in line with the current approach.
The employing unit shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if it ceases to work due to high temperature weather or shortens the working time.
Employees who do not receive a high-temperature subsidy for work under high-temperature conditions may seek legal rights and interests through the labour dispute mediation agency in which the enterprise is located, or call 12333 complaints, the municipal council said.
If an employing unit refuses to grant a high-temperature allowance, the worker may complain to the competent human resources and social security department at or above the county level where the worker is located.
At the same time, because the high-temperature allowance is part of wages, not welfare, to include the total wage and deduct a tax.
Hence, the high-temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage range and must be paid in cash and cannot be replaced by physical objects such as beverages.
The newly constructed Urumqi station is located in the Urumqi city high-speed section and the entire building area is about 1 million square meters.
The ground floors 1 and 2 are for entrances, waiting rooms and offices and commercial premises, and the ground floors 1 and 2 are for exits.
At present, Urumqi station is the largest integrated transport hub in Xinjiang, integrating high-speed rail, railway, bus, and taxi, etc., can realize seamless interconnection of different modes of transfer.
There are three ticket booths on both sides of the station platform north-south and north-east, with 39 individual ticket windows and 34 vending machines.
In the area of check-in tickets, there are 30 corridors on both sides of the waiting hall east and west. Passengers can make a quick check-in and check-out depending on the check-in number on the ticket.
If you need help, you can select the 41 call buttons that are set near the station to get timely service.
From July 1, old passenger trains, that is, passenger trains from Urumqi South Station, travelled separately to Urumqi Station.
In other words, all motor vehicles and 30 pairs of outbound trains can be parked at Urumqi station.
Now both stations can buy tickets, and the trains pass between them for about 10 minutes, and passengers should pay attention to the specific station names of the ticket departure and destination.
The official start-up of Urumqi New Passenger Station will be an important platform for Xinjiang to create a national integrated transportation city and promote the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and new districts.
Grecia is a blooming female big-mouthed bird, full of a tropical rainforest breath.
In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the story of the giant-billed greece and its story is well-known.
At a press conference on August 10, recovered Georgia finally showed up, showing people its brand new 3D printed plastic bird beak.
Just a year and a half ago, a big-mouthed bird that had been cut off its beak and was dying was finally reborn.
This day not only proclaims that it is 100% healthy, but also the day when it moves to a luxury birdhouse and meets its human friends who care about it.
Grecia, the first to join the new family, was a little shy, but in short order she became active, rolling around in the basin and eating grapes with her new beak.
To remind people of the damage it had suffered, the technicians did not paint its new beak, but kept the original white 3D print material.
Outside the beak there is a thin cortical sheath, in which there is nothing but a few thin bone support rods intersecting.
Although there is such an internal strengthening component, the beak of the giant-billed bird is fragile and breaks when damaged.
A team of animal rescue centers, bird scientists and a 3D printing company in the United States worked together to create several "test beaks" for Greece, finally creating the perfect beak for it.
Today, Greece is skilled in using its new beak to drink water, eat food, and even peck small grains.
"The final design took about two months and printed out in just four or five hours.
"3D printing isn't a technology of the future, it's really entering your lives," Thomas Lang, chairman of SG3D Printing, said to reporters in Xinhua International.
In January 2015, a farm in the central Costa Rican province of Gracia, in the province of Alahuela, was found to contain a bloody giant-nose bird, Gracia.
Its upper beak was violently broken by a group of young men, and it was completely unable to eat, and life was in danger.
The tragedy in Greece has sparked a wave of protests against animal abuse both inside and outside Costa Rica, following media reports.
There are calls for stricter animal protection laws and more punitive measures against abusers.
People spontaneously came and did their utmost to help Greece regain as much life as possible before the injury.
Even the inventor of 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, was involved in the design of the Georgian beak.
"Greece is very special, with less than one centimeter left of its upper beak, which makes it very difficult to install a new beak.
"We first scanned Grecia, then designed and produced an extended prosthetic body slightly longer than the rest of its upper beak, which was glued to its upper beak.
"This would reduce further invasive damage to Greece," Lang told Xinhua International reporters.
Before installing the prosthetic, the staff cleaned the beak for Greece every day to prevent infection.
Far beyond a thousand miles, the story of the giant-billed Grecia touched well-known documentary director Paula Edia and Discovery Channel producer John Hoffman.
They recorded glimpses of Greece installing its new beak, and recorded a documentary titled "The Land of the Big-billed Birds", which was aired on Animal Planet this month.
The documentary, The Country of the Big-billed Bird, shows how a tiny big-billed bird can make a country change, and how people can participate in the fight against animal abuse.
Key hint: Japanese oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as teapots.
JX Energy, Japan's largest oil company, said "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the downturn in the market.
Japan's oil companies are particularly wary of the rise of small independent refineries in China, known as teapots.
The quality of China's oil products is approaching Japan's oil products as the Chinese government tightens its environmental regulations.
Prior to obtaining a permit to import crude oil, the teapot refinery usually extracts heavy oils with high sulphur content from Russia and other places.
The sulphur content of the petroleum products produced is high and the oil products are poor, which is one of the causes of environmental pollution.
After obtaining oil import permits, the teapot refinery was able to import low sulphur-content Iranian and Russian crude oils, and the quality of its oil products was also improved.
"As the quality standards of China's domestic oil products improve, the ability of refining plants also increases," said Dongfu General Petroleum.
As a result, the quality of Chinese oil products exported abroad gradually reached the same level as (the world's highest quality) Japan."
"After the end of 2015, China began exporting high-quality light oil to Australia," JX Energy said, competing with Japanese products in Asian markets.
Although "Japanese high-grade oil" is facing a crisis, the Japanese oil company's response strategy is to "export it to profitable regions while paying attention to market conditions."
As the oil products exported from China have a huge impact on the market in Asia, the concern for teapot refineries is also increasingly high.
On May 26, 2016, after two months of registration, more than 800 poor students applied for scholarships.
In the course of the scholarship, more than 120,000 yuan in social contributions have been received (five public notices have been distributed), which can help at least 240 students of the University.
At present, the donations are still continuing, and this paper calls on society to continue to extend its help, so that more children with family problems can be supported and cared for by society.
In order to ensure the fairness, openness and transparency of the activities of scholarships, this paper today issued a partial publicity of basic information for pupils, and today published the 1st to 100th students, subject to the supervision of the reader.
The Sunshine Initiative, a well-known charitable brand in China, was launched in Jiangsu in 2003 by the Yangtze Evening Post and has helped more than 4,000 poor students.
The activities are funded by the university entrance examination undergraduate admission of freshmen, excluding tuition-free specialty; good manners and superiority, family poverty.
The Bureau of Statistics said New Zealand's population growth had previously exceeded 2 per cent during the baby boom of 1974 and the early 1950s and 1960s.
As of June this year, the net influx of immigrants in New Zealand in 12 months was 6.91 million, the main driver of population growth in New Zealand in recent years.
In addition, at the same time, the population of New Zealand grew naturally to 28.2 million.
The figures show that in the last 10 years, New Zealand has had an annual net influx of 2,18 million immigrants and an annual natural population growth of 3,23 million.
From a demographic perspective, the influx of large numbers of immigrants means that the proportion of the “working-age population” between the ages of 15 and 39 is gradually increasing.
As of June 2016, New Zealand's working-age population grew by 3.6% over the 12-month period to 15.8 million.
At the same time, the aging population over the age of 65 grew by 3.6 per cent, reaching 70,000.
Yesterday morning, at 10 a.m., the X9003 international freight train departed from Xi'an Xinjiang station for Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The opening of the train marks the Xi'an Railway Authority's success in exceeding 10,000 trains since the 2013 Central Asia International freight line opened.
It is understood that this freight carrier class covers six major categories of industrial raw materials, mechanical equipment, industrial spare parts, building materials, foodstuffs and light-duty products, with a total of 206 varieties.
As of 11 August this year, the new station operated 21 sub-cars and 1009 cars, totaling 33.8 million tons of export goods, of which 84 cars were operated in 2016, up 47%.
It is known that the first trains carried by the China-Asia line were made in Shaanxi, and today it has attracted a large number of foreign goods sources.
As of the end of July, the volume of containers in the Central Asia series exceeded 40,000 units, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2015.
With the encryption of the Central Asia railway line, the freight volume of the newly constructed Xi'an Railway Station is increasing year by year.
As of August 10, 2016, the shipment volume had reached 153.1 million tons, an increase of 6.7 per cent year-on-year.
In order to meet the future development needs, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has put in place plans for the construction of the Xi'an Xi'an Xi'an Xi'an Xi'an Railway Integrated Logistics Center center centered on the newly constructed station, and has worked hard to create a modern Xi'an Xi'an Xi'an Railway Integrated Logistics Park.
An Indian uncle was shocked to land on a plane at Dubai International Airport last week when he received a million-dollar prize at the same airport.
An Indian resident of Dubai, Mohammed Bashir Abdul-Haddar, had a habit of buying lottery tickets every time he returned home.
His 21-year-old son was paralyzed by an accidental fall at the age of 13, and he has been working hard to repay his son's medical expenses loan.
"It was God who gave me my second life, and gave me this money to do good," said Herdar.
Although it's autumn now, the Autumn Tiger's power doesn't seem to be any worse than summer.
UV rays not only blacken the students' skin, but also cause skin damage, how to make the skin pass the military training smoothly, without being injured?
Sunscreens are usually labeled with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sunscreen index, which is aimed at UVB ultraviolet rays. Our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, etc.
PA-labelled products are targeted to UVA, so sunscreens play a more effective role. In most cases, PA-intensity is indicated by +, and more than one + indicates an extended effective protection time.
Oily skin should choose water-resistant sunscreen with strong permeability, sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Dry skin should choose cream-like sunscreen products; neutral skin is generally not strictly regulated, sensitive skin is a burden to wash any maintenance products, it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.
Remember to apply sunscreen half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to fully penetrate the skin.
Military training sunshine time is longer, sunscreen should be rubbed once every two hours to have a lasting effect, do not lazy.
Because the skin has just been exposed to sunlight, military training does not come back immediately with whitening products.
After military training, if necessary, towels with ice blocks can be used to cool burned skin to relieve some of the dryness.
Farmers who buy agricultural machinery during the exhibition will continue to apply the policy of incremental subsidies. Farmers who buy agricultural machinery will receive a maximum of 40 per cent of the subsidies.
The exhibition is aimed at attracting foreign investors to the world, especially by increasing the invitation to countries along the Belt and Road Strategy and target market countries.
This year's exhibition will strive to complete 60 Chinese investment projects, bring in 220 billion yuan in investment, and sign more than 160 trade contracts worth 32 billion yuan.
It is reported that the "Shon Expo" has been operating in Loudy for seven consecutive years, due to the strong manufacturing industry base in Loudy, Hunan Province, and the long history of industrial development.
As the host of the Xiangbo Festival, Loudy has established trade relations with more than 90 countries around the world.
The Xiangbo Fair is an important platform for the local development of specialized industries and the promotion of specialized industries outside the country.
On some nights, the ionic layer is filled with free electrons, which means that wireless signals can go further.
The U.S. Air Force is interested in replicating the effect, according to the August 11 article in the American Science Monthly.
Although an ionized layer with a stable mass of free electrons can help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station's broadcast range, this may not be the interest of the U.S. Air Force.
Electron-filled isolation layers mean that military radio has a wider range of transmissions and may provide some protection for Global Positioning System (GPS) signals so that they are not affected by solar storms.
The ultimate goal may be to build a series of triangular satellites based on demand, which can strengthen the ionization layer when needed.
But first, the teams that have contracted with the Air Force must prove that the scientific principles are working.
According to industry data, the total coal capacity in 2015 was close to 60 billion tons, with the country's coal capacity exceeding 180 billion tons.
Over the last decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notifications on the elimination of excess and backward capacity.
Although the previous four did not target the coal industry, the target industry has a direct relationship with the coal industry.
From November last year to January this year, the price of 5,500 big-carbon diesel coal on Qin Qing Island has long been low at 370 yuan/tonne, and 90% of coal enterprises have suffered losses.
Since February, coal prices have been steadily rising, and the price of Qin Dynamic Coal has been rising for four consecutive weeks, reaching a 16-month high, rising to 436 yuan per ton, nearly 70 yuan more than at the beginning of the year.
With the rise in prices, there are concerns that a number of small coal mines will be restarted.
This is analyzed and interpreted by Kuan Xianming, head of the China Institute of Economics for Reform and Development in Hainan.
Kuan Xianming: The decommissioning of the coal industry has attracted a great deal of attention, and the results of the decommissioning of the coal industry released today are also a cause for concern.
These three layers also reflect the reason why our growth patterns in the past have been relatively lagging behind, namely that the government-led growth patterns have not yet been fundamentally transformed.
Secondly, this is directly related to the efforts of local governments to promote capacity, and in the process of decoupling, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures must be put in place. From this point of view, the differences in different regions are really large.
Third, there is a greater risk that some provinces will catch up in the second half if their current progress is slower.
In this case, the process of relying on central bonus funds to promote capacity-depletion may have some negative effects.
First of all, de-capacity is not a simple matter of total control.
Our aim is to restructure the entire coal industry by eliminating backward capacity, promoting structural optimization and restructuring.
In the process of deploying decommissioning capacity, local governments must combine decommissioning capacity with the modernization of coal industry and develop related services vigorously.
Secondly, if we are to complete this year's de-capacity task within this year, we need to take full advantage of the power of administrative oversight and supervision.
Finally, we need to strengthen the underlying role of social security.
Since the market directly involves employment problems, we should strengthen the employment skills training of employees and employees.
"The reason for the decline in the rankings is the deterioration in foreign investment expectations for the growth of Brazil's GDP in the medium term.
In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.
The Bank's international investment attractiveness index includes four sub-indexes: infrastructure, economic prospects, business environment and amount of direct investment.
In 2015, Brazil’s international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.
Last year, Brazil's greenfield investment (the investment model for investing in plants abroad) was $179 billion, down 2.1% year-on-year.
"There are 288 green investment projects in Brazil, compared to an average of 314 in 2003-2014."
However, in the first half of 2016, international direct investment in Brazil reached $33.8 billion, almost 10% more than in the same period last year.
Canadian Police Kill ISIS Supporters: Self-propelled Bombs Injure Crowds Ready to Work Near the End
The taxi company said the taxi had been dispatched to the driver's home before the police arrived.
In a news conference Wednesday, Canadian police said the information they received included "martyr video" provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation about the young man who was about to carry out the attack.
According to German voices, a man wearing a black parachute was reading the Qur'an, referring to crimes against Muslims, and vowing to launch an attack on a city in Canada soon.
He said in the video that the attack would take place within 72 hours, and at peak time.
It was the first time police killed a terrorist suspect before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took office last year.
Passenger fees will be charged from 1 September on the Old Wanfu River and North Daejeong Roads of the upgraded and renovated Keihang Daejeong Canal Lines.
The two channels have been rebuilt with social financing, and the fee has been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.
The Old Wanfu River passes through Jinxiang, Tsuchidai, and passes through Lake Nanyang into the main route of the Beijing-Honghai Canal, a total length of 32.5 km.
According to the needs of navigation, the old Wanfu River waterway adopted conservation modification method, dredging the depth of the local water, cutting and straightening the sharp bend of the local waterway, etc., the conditions of navigation were improved.
The route passes through Jinxiang County and Nanyang City, and passes through Lake Nanyang to the main route of the Beijing-Honghai Canal, a total length of 19 kilometres.
The construction of the two canals began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015, with the main investment and operational entity being the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center in Jinin City.
In accordance with the principle of "Credit Construction and Fee Repayment", the Anping Logistics Service Centre of Jinning City levies shipping tolls in accordance with the standards of charges approved by Shandong Province Price Bureau.
Of these, basic tolls are charged at $1.75/tonne and mile tolls at $0.05/km.
The tolls will be levied from 15 June 2016 to 14 June 2019.
It was noted that there are currently four toll roads in Jinning, namely Sui Shui River Road, Bai Ma River Road, North Dao Tam Road, and Old Wanfu River Road.
The four routes, which are the backstream routes of the Main Canal, are upgraded and refurbished by means of social financing.
The upgrade and redevelopment of Sui Waterway is the first to use the "Government + Market" model for the construction of the inland waterway port infrastructure in Shandong Province. The government is the main investor and the social funds supplement the funding gap.
The branch shipping routes such as the Baima River, the Old Wanfu River, and the North Daejeon River take a purely market-oriented way of operating.
The funds allocated by the state budget do not meet the needs of the construction of the project and restrict the progress of the upgrade of the navigation channel.
Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure complies with the requirements of national policy, also becomes the way to break the bottleneck of funds.
Ning Zetao's performance in the 100m freestyle semi-finals has left many Chinese spectators speechless.
But just in the 50m freestyle pre-race, Ningzetao renew people's "bottom line".
In fact, the 50m freestyle swim is not the main event of Ningze Tao, his performance and best results at the Kazan World Championships, also determined that he is unlikely to break in this project.
Indeed, the Hong Kong's authoritative media, The Great Public Gazette, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao's loss of profits was that he had lost interest in swimming.
Many outside factors may have influenced his thoughts about the future, and he may be more interested in the entertainment industry now.
After the Kazan World Championships, Ningze Tao with his super high face value and good performance, instantly became a net red.
As a result, names such as "national husband", "small meat", "flowery man" and so on have become a label on him.
All kinds of business activities come to the door, beautiful money routes, become a golden-blinking avenue.
In this case, even choosing to retire at this time to join the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly feasible path.
After all, he's only 23 years old, and after a certain amount of study, he can play one or two television shows entirely with his charm.
But Ning Zetao needs to see if he has enough qualifications compared to those of his predecessors?
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the 21-year-old Liu Xuan has come to the end of her athlete career.
Liu Xuan's beautiful appearance made her quickly remembered by people, and also laid the foundations for her future military entertainment circle.
After retirement, Liu Yuan appeared in several television series and established his own studio in 2013.
He participated in two Olympics in the men's and women's singles 10 metre relay, winning two gold and two silver medals.
However, after losing to his teammate Hu Jia in the men's 10 metre relay at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Tae Liang's competitive condition deteriorated and he was fired by the dive team.
And he and his daughter participated in "Daddy's Where" and other entertainment programs, even earned him enough eyeball.
Yang Wei, Li Xiaoping and Chen Ichi-qiang, former gymnasts of the Golden Generation, participated in a variety of entertainment programs.
It is worth noting that Yang Wei Li Xiaoping led China to win the 2008 Olympics men's team championship, and Yang Wei has twice won the individual all-around gold medal, known as the All-Around King.
Chen won the 2012 Olympic group championship while leading China.
After losing the gold medal in the London Olympics by mistake, Chen's ice-sized gesture also caused him to be innumerable.
But the main focus of these athletes is still on the field, and the entertainment program is just like a dragonfly dropping water -- it's just going to happen.
But whether you're a retired or an active athlete, you'll need to make sure that you've achieved something that's safe for the entertainment community.
After all, athletes are entering a new field, both in their abilities and in their bloodline, which is a blank.
Even "old people" such as Tan Liang and Liu Xuan, who have been in the entertainment industry for years, are mentioned by ordinary audiences, and more often thought of their performance at the Olympics.
Newcomers such as Yang Wei and Li Xiaoping, who were introduced at the show, were "Olympic champions" without any exception.
Compared to the above, Ning Zhao's title as a world champion in swimming is still a bit slim.
Moreover, compared to the achievements of Tan Liang, Liu Xuan, Yang Wei and others, if Ning Ze Tao at the age of 23 and the sports career has suffered some setbacks, rapidly retreat, the negative impact on his image is probably incalculable.
After all, when it comes to athletes, people's demands are "do not seek a hundred fights a hundred victories, but do not fear the difficulties," Ning Zhao is far from this point.
Ten thousand steps back says that Ningze Tao is handsome and can rely entirely on the face value to get the support of tens of thousands of brain residue.
No hard work, just look out, want to be in the entertainment circle, it's more difficult than a good training to find the state to respond to.
The choice of the way of life depends entirely on the will of the individual, but in the end how to choose, Ningze Tao should have a number in his heart.
On the surface, social networking platforms have expanded the circle of communication and reduced people's sense of loneliness.
The scope of network social influence is increasingly wide, not only gradually replaces traditional telephone communication, even penetrates into the real life circle below, quietly changing the social life of the current people.
The benefits of online social networking are obvious, such as convenience and speed, so it is particularly popular among young people.
A survey of college students' social habits showed that 57 per cent of college students spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones, and that their daily lives are essentially "unattended".
"Social networks have characteristics such as low cost, fast transmission speed, and simultaneous communication of many people, which meet the demands of contemporary college students."
Expanding the circle of relationships, having a more equal dialogue and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we're more and more in love online.
A newcomer to the company loves to communicate with colleagues online, "because the newcomers aren't very familiar with each other, and the relationship is much closer than it used to be through peer-to-peer reviews on social media."
People who love to make friends also often communicate online. "I didn't get in touch with my friends for a while because of some mistakes, and then it got hot in a big group with a few words of conversation.
IT engineer Wu Guan is a profound network social enthusiast. He spends most of his social life online, and network contacts are more than twice the number of people around him.
Wu also admitted that he was more "like fish getting water" on the network.
You can reply to your friends whenever you like, because there is plenty of time to make your statements clearer.
"You hide under the ID and I avoid face-to-face human collisions, giving each other more time and space to think and act," he said.
"People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speak, and social concerns in real life seem to be eliminated in cyberspace.
However, Wu Wen's friend Xiao Peng felt that Wu Wen in his life was "a very uninteresting houseman".
Xiao Peng and Wu Guan met in a large group, because both of them were active speakers, and soon became acquainted.
Xiao Peng thinks that Wu's word and the Internet if two people, the word is boring, and does not take the initiative to make an opinion, over and over again is just a few sentences "Hah, okay, is it not" or "I'm going to check this on the Internet."
The police have now intervened in the investigation, and the transportation department of陵水 will also step up efforts to regulate illegally operating vehicles.
"Police have not yet investigated the 4 August clashes, and at 0:00 p.m. on 11 August, two other drivers' taxis were hit again at their homes.
"Nowadays the three-wheelers operate mostly illegally at night, and I hope the competent authorities will also step up their efforts to deal with this.
The police have received reports of the two cases, the cause of the two cases, who committed them, whether they are related, etc. are under further investigation.
Wang Wenyi, head of the traffic management station of the陵水交通局, said that the陵水交通部门 began to correct illegally operated three-wheelers earlier this year, and a total of 613 illegally operated three-wheelers were banned.
Next, the transportation department will apply to the county government, and jointly multi-sectoral efforts will be intensified to correct illegally operated vehicles such as three-wheelers, motorcycles, and black cars throughout the county.
At 8 a.m. on August 11, the Zilu Evening News reporter accompanied the Health China Clinical Service Team to the village of Xihu Zhenhe Guo in the East Hong Kong area.
The village is remote, about 24 kilometres from the city centre, and has more than 200 inhabitants. Because of its economic, transportation and physical limitations, many elderly and middle-aged patients find it difficult to go out to see the doctors.
The clinical projects are comprehensive, including internal, surgical, respiratory, psychiatric, skin and pediatric.
Many of the villagers heard that the clinical experts were coming, and had been waiting in the small square in the village early.
She, 67, suffers from a congenital spinal cord bend, and in recent years she has been plagued by "asthma" so much that even walking up a slope she can't breathe.
The doctor told her that chronic bronchitis is unlikely to be cured at all, and that it can be relieved if she keeps on taking medication.
At the dermatologist's clinic, a 60-year-old man came to see her granddaughter.
The oldest grandchild, 11 years old this year, has been plagued by the left leg from the age of three.
The doctor checked and told the old man that it was not a "suck" but a seasonal eczema, and that you shouldn't delay treatment by taking medication at will.
"In this village, we provide nursing and B-supervision services, while another team in the village of Xiangcheu family shops in Guilin County also provides free medical examination services.
The downtown clinic is just one part of Health China, and other activities will continue in the days to come.
51Talk Free English is considered to be a milestone in building an ecosystem for the online education industry.
CEO Huang Jiao said bringing the world's best learning resources to Chinese children is their strategy for the next five years.
It is understood that "51Talk's greatest advantage lies in being able to meet the needs of users of different ages."
Chief Operating Officer Zhang Yiming said that parents will no longer use boatloads and spend precious time picking up and dropping off their children by connecting the world's top quality foreign teachers and services to students.

The mayor of Rivas, Villefredo Lopes, said at the teacher training site that the Nicaraguan government agencies are working hard to promote environmental management plans and tree-planting activities with the HKND Group.
As a canal project developer, HKND Group has always followed international best practices and built canals according to international standards to maximize protection of Nicaragua's ecological environment.
By combining theory and practice, the university students will lead elementary school students to plant trees together and educate the next generation of Nicaraguans on how to green the environment.
Francisco Reyes, a professor of Natural Resources and Environment at the National Agricultural University of Nicaragua, participated in a forest-planting education project.
We have reason to believe that the transatlantic canal project, which is also led by HKND Group, will bring more benefits to the people of Nicaragua and create more jobs there."
In order to ensure the long-term impact of tree-planting, the HKND Group has also exhibited a training booklet on tree-planting and distributed it to all 150,000 primary and secondary school students in Rivas, with the aim of providing long-term technical guidance to teachers and parents.

On August 11, Huang Ilin, who had returned to Sichuan Province's Mianyang home for a telephone interview, said, "The situation was so urgent that I had only one idea to save people!
Huang Ilin is a student of the 2015 Graduate School of Landscape and Gardening of the University of Central and South China.
Huang Ilin, a city and country planning specialist, wants to visit Sichuan and study the local architectural design, and goes to travel with a family.
At about 10 a.m. on August 8th, Huang Ilin's father took a break at the hotel, and the two mothers went out to visit the ancient city.
Just as we were leaving, suddenly we saw a group of people screaming and screaming, and out of curiosity we went ahead.
The little boy had disappeared, the little girl was struggling in the water, her little head was barely visible on the river, and from time to time she was sinking. Huang Ilin, who had been learning to swim when she was a child, jumped down and rescued her.
After the sinking, Huang Ilin, 165 cm tall, found that it was not the end of the step!
The water looked calm before, but underneath it was turbulent!
But she still wandered to the little girl despite everything.
Huang Ilin said the river was turbid and turbulent, and the distance of less than five meters was almost exhausting her.
She pushed the little girl to the bank of the river with all her might. The slope was particularly slippery, and I was afraid I would sink without strength.
Then, Huang Ilin asks her mother to rescue, hear her daughter's cry, poor watery Ms. Yin prepares to dive to rescue, was stopped by a visitor next door.
On August 10, after the story of Huang Ilin jumping to rescue the rescuers was revealed, Ms. Yin received a lot of sympathy and praise from her relatives as well as a lot of "praise" from her relatives.
"I'm really scared when I think back now! To tell the truth, when the kid was on the banks of the river, and he couldn't keep up, my heart broke when he asked me for help.
Despite the danger, Ms. Yun said with a heartbeat, she would still support her daughter's choice if she were to be in that situation again. She's proud of her daughter!
Due to the pressure, Huang Ilin rarely took the initiative to dive again after learning to swim, "I didn't think this skill was really useful."
According to the director of Huang Ilin's class, Chen, Huang Ilin is a well-known "master of the class" and is happy to help.

Groups of fraudulent text messages reach a certain number, even if they do not defraud hands, can also defraud criminal charges.
The People's Court of Guanglong District, Nanyang City, Henan Province, determined that, from September 30 to October 4, 2015, defendant Li Xiangwang used fake base station equipment to send fraudulent information in Kirby County and Nanyang City.
The same year, on October 5, at 10 a.m., the defendant was arrested by the Public Security Police (PSC) when he again arrived in a hotel room in Yulong District, Nanyang City, using fake base stations to send fraudulent text messages.
It was estimated that the fake base station device sent 62228 text messages on October 4, 2015, resulting in communication interruptions of more than 8 seconds to less than 10 minutes per mobile phone user per person.
The court held that defendant Lee Cheung Wang had committed fraud by using a fake base station to send fraudulent text messages to an unspecified majority of persons, amounting to a total of 6,228 articles.
The defendant's argument that the defendant had failed to commit an offence and had not caused consequences when he was arrested was well-admitted, and it was suggested that his views on light punishment should be taken into account.
Consequences such as the nature of the offence and the attitude of acknowledgment of the accused shall be punished by fixed-term imprisonment of four years and six months for fraud and a fine of 10,000 yuan.
The Northeast Tiger is currently listed in the Red List of Endangered Species of the World Conservation Union (IUCN).
According to the Jilin Forestry Office, there are only four to six wild Northeast Tigers and three to five Northeast Leopards in Jilin province, according to a 1998 joint monitoring by China, Russia and other countries.
According to Chang Chun, director of the Department of Forestry Protection of Jilin Province, Jilin Province has been increasing the protection of wildlife in recent years, and the number of Northeast Tigers and Northeast Leopards in China is growing significantly and the area of distribution is expanding.
According to the latest 2015 monitoring data, 27 wild Northeast Tigers and 42 Northeast Leopards were monitored in Jilin Province alone.
As a flagship species of the world wildlife conservation in the border region of China and Russia, cooperation between China and Russia is of great significance for the restoration and reproduction of the wild northeastern tiger and leopard.
According to the Ministry of Forestry, Jilin has established long-term and stable cooperation and exchange mechanisms with Russia.
At the 2016 International Forum for the Protection of Chinese Tigers and Leopards, which ended on November 11, the forestry sector and animal protection organizations of China and Russia reached a number of consensus again.
The Ministry of Forestry of Jilin Province said that the strengthening of cooperation between China and Russia in the protection of tiger and leopard species is not only an urgent task facing China's Northeast tiger and leopard protection, but also a matter of urgency to maintain the health of the Russian tiger and leopard species.
Sun Fuku remained a leading member of the Party, lost his ideal conviction, severely violated the Party's discipline, and after the Party's eighteenth general election, he did not converge, did not take his hand, and went against the rules, and the nature of the situation was bad and serious.
After this case occurred, after several media reports, became a focus case, the social impact is extremely bad.
After the case occurred, Haikou Public Prosecutor's Office's Criminal Police Branch leadership attached great importance to it and immediately organized a large team of highly skilled police forces to launch an offensive and launch an investigation.
The police immediately pursued the suspect on the Internet, took a variety of measures to prosecute him, and collaborated with the police on the ground to find out where the king was.
Due to the fact that the suspect is a habitual thief and has been dealt with repeatedly by the public security organs, he has a strong anti-detection capability, plus he has been a long-time drug addict, and he is often questioned about addiction, and the interrogation work is very difficult.
Greenland sharks, also known as small-headed sleep sharks, are widespread in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland, reaching a height of 4 to 5 metres in adulthood.
But their growth rate is extremely slow, sometimes only about 1 cm in length a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an exceptionally long lifespan.
Traditional methods of ageing usually use animal calcified tissue, which can be used in some sharks with fin vertebrae, but this calcified tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
A new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, used the eye crystals of Greenland sharks for radioactive carbon dating.
This method had previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it was the first time that it was used to determine the age of fish such as sharks.
Their analysis showed that the largest shark's life expectancy was estimated at 392 years, with an error of 120 years.
This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and may reach a maximum of 512 years.
Furthermore, female Greenland sharks are said to be sexually mature by about 4 meters in height, in other words, at least 156 years old.
According to the researchers, Greenland sharks are the world's oldest known vertebrate, surpassing previous long-lived champions of the Red Whale (211 years old).
Over the past year, the exchange rate of the renminbi has remained fundamentally stable, while laying the foundations for the internationalization of the renminbi.
Based on market performance, over the past year, the renminbi's exchange rate has clearly been floating in two directions, the exchange rate elasticity has improved, and the exchange rate is expected to remain stable overall.
The exchange rate has fluctuated more and more frequently since the changeover, but the exchange rate has been declining.
The last revaluation measure before last year’s “8-11” was implemented in 2005, when the renminbi rose dramatically against the dollar over a decade.
Since the introduction of the new exchange rate, the renminbi has changed its previous appreciation, depreciating by about 8 per cent over the course of the year.
On October 1 this year, the International Monetary Fund will formally adopt the renminbi as the SDR weighted currency.
China's imports and exports totalled RMB 13.21 trillion seven months ago, down 3 per cent year-on-year, according to statistics released by the Chinese Customs Department this week.
In July, China's total import and export value fell by only 0.9 per cent year-on-year, and exports, in particular, rose by 2.9 per cent.
Experts believe there should be no high expectations, despite signs of steady imports and exports in July.
In July, the total value of Chinese imports and exports fell by 0.9 per cent year-on-year to RMB 2.09 trillion.
Among them, exports of RMB 1.2 trillion rose 2.9%, imports of RMB 87.3 trillion decreased 5.7%, and trade surpluses of RMB 34.2 trillion increased 34%.
Although the total value of imports and exports declined year-on-year, export data showed growth, which is the fifth consecutive month of growth since March this year.
Shanghai Police arrested more than 3,400 robbers in four months to crack down on 157 gangs involved in robbery and deception
While investigating the case, the police also seized stolen goods worth more than RMB 3,300 million.
According to the members of the group, they entered Shanghai from the outside by packing in a black car, then dropped off separately, and a few hours later each of them joined the car and left Shanghai together.
In the course of the case, the suspect often uses a building as a unit, climbing the outer walls and ripping off the window fence from the top to the bottom "sweep-down" theft.
The suspect has been transferred to the Xu Hui District Prosecutor's Office to examine the prosecution.
The police reminded the masses of citizens to lock their doors and windows when they go out, and suggested that they should choose hard steel as a choice for preventing theft of windows.
At the end of August, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Kenya to attend the sixth Africa Development Conference, according to China's China News Network.
The African Development Conference, led by Japan and preceded by five meetings held in Tokyo or Yokohama in Japan, will also be the first to shift Africa.
Japanese foreign ministry officials said that meetings in Africa locally would help raise African and European countries' concerns about Japan.
To accompany Shinzo Abe's visit, Japan's Liberal Democratic Party will send a delegation of MPs to the countries concerned, according to the Associated Press.
It is no coincidence that Japan’s path to “normalization” began in the early 1990s, and that the Africa Development Conference, which was launched by Japan, also began in 1993.
Africa has 53 seats in the United Nations, an important seat for the United Nations, and how can Japan abandon Africa if it wants to be “common”?
There will also be an exchange of views with relevant stakeholders on countermeasures to extremist organizations such as the Islamic State and terrorist activities.
The Western Group will visit seven countries, including Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau.
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida recently stated his intentions at the United Nations Security Council on the Africa Development Conference.
Abe, meanwhile, announced aid worth 10 billion yen (approximately ¥61 billion) in five years to stabilize countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Observers generally believe that Japan's generosity to Africa has always had two main purposes: first, to increase Japan's sense of presence in Africa; and, second, to gain support from African countries on the issue of accession.
"From a political point of view, although Africa is relatively lagging behind in its development, it has a large number of countries, which is why Japan has always regarded it as the so-called 'big field'," analyst Yang Bei-jiang, a Japanese expert, said.
Japan will not give up in the future, and the work on Africa will not stop there and will continue to be strengthened.
On the economic side, domestic demand is relatively weak, especially in the context of the aging of few children, as Japan's production capacity is relatively strong, but the domestic market is relatively limited.
However, from Shinichiro Koizumi ten years ago to Abe ten years later, Japan has repeatedly launched a "suicide attack", but all of this has come back to nothing.
Expert on Japan Yang Bei-jiang believes that Japan's intention is clear, but the road to normality will be difficult and difficult.
If Japan is to achieve its goals, it must first have good relations with its neighbours, and Japan needs to have the right attitude, whether in geopolitical conflicts or in national disputes and in questions of historical understanding.

New highlights introduced by traditional customs "2016 Puolan Cultural Festival" opens at Hong Kong Viyuan
The music of drumming, the traditional snacks, the gorgeous decoration, the crowded scenery.
The 2016 Poultry Culture Festival, hosted by the Hong Kong Association of Poultry Societies, was held in Victoria Park from 12 to 14 February 2016 and is the largest poultry competition in Hong Kong.
In addition to continuing the existing "logging competition," the family can participate in the "parent pool for composting competition".
In addition to introducing the history of Puolan culture in cartoon form, the site also has a Puolan theme 3D selfie area, traditional snack area and traditional handicrafts mobile classroom, etc., attracting many children and overseas people to experience the visit.
A couple from France stayed at the event for nearly three hours, and had a little experience in a mini-card mobile classroom.
"I found this special holiday on the internet, so I decided to come and see it. It's very fresh.
They say that although France has similar festivals to commemorate its ancestors, the atmosphere is heavy, unlike here, where there is music, food and learning traditional crafts.
She said, "In Hong Kong, a busy financial city, you can see such large-scale, organized rituals of worshipping your ancestors.
"This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also enables more people to understand and inherit these traditional crafts.
"We don't want to make it scary and scary, especially for children," said Hu, the general coordinator of the event.
"We want young people to know that the culture behind the Puolan festival is about filial piety and gratitude through youthful activities and arrangements on the spot."
He also said that there were 24 teams participating in the "lonely robbery contest," which included not only community organizations but also schools that allowed students to participate.
It is known that the Hong Kong Gypsies' Paelang Festival was included in the National Non-Machine Cultural Heritage List in 2011.
On the evening of the 11th, the National Theatre of China, accompanied by the famous play The White Snake, traveled thousands of miles to Mexico City, Mexico City, where the Mexican National Gallery of Fine Arts presented the local people with a traditional Chinese theater feast.
As a key performance project of the "Year of Cultural Exchange between China and Latin America", from August 9 to 23, the Chinese National Opera House will perform seven Beijing operas in Mexico City, Mexico City, and in five cities such as Córdoba, Wallace, etc.
The audience followed the storyline of the White Snake story, the singing of the actors, sometimes with a heart smile, sometimes with a warm applause.
Maria Himennis Cajo, who had watched the Beijing Opera 15 years ago, accompanied her daughter to finish the show.
"It was an amazing performance, and I was impressed by the music, the lights and the stage performances, and I felt it was necessary for my daughter to get to know Chinese culture and the Chinese opera.
The enthusiasm of the Mexican audience left a deep impression on the actors and young actors.
"I didn't think Mexican audiences were so enthusiastic, and I was a little worried about their understanding of the story, but it was unexpected to see them capture the plot and many jokes today.
China's Ambassador to Mexico, Mr. Cheu Xiaoqi, said that the cultural exchange activities of this year's "China-Mexico Year of Cultural Exchange" have a positive role to play in promoting a deeper understanding and enhanced friendship between the peoples of China and Mexico.
Next year, the 45th anniversary of the establishment of the two countries, there will be more cultural exchanges in the two countries.
Liu Qiu goes to Asia to investigate "double repair, double city" demands to raise the level of urban construction and management
On the morning of 12th, Mr. Liu gave the chairmanship of the symposium, where he listened to the report on the progress of the trial work of the twin cities and the suggestions of the relevant departments.
Liu gave his full appreciation to the phased results achieved in the pilot work and the good experiences and good practices created.
Liu Qiu stressed that Asia should seize the opportunity for historical development and take the pilot work of "Double Schooling" and "Double City" as an important handhold, and fully play the leading role of good demonstration in the economic and social development of the province.
In order to raise the international tourist island international level to play a leading role, from the tip of the detail, enrich the international elements, make international goods.
To play a leading role in urban-rural integration and all-territorial tourism, to speed up the construction of characteristic scenic towns, to integrate tourism elements into each project, to make every village and town in Asia into tourist scenic spots.
To play a leading role in the "100 Days of Social Investment in Services" initiative, to promote the construction of a number of major projects and parks, to ensure that high-quality projects are implemented, and to implement the requirements of the initiative.
Chairman of the Central Committee of the People's Party of China, secretary of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Asia, Zhang Qi, deputy governor Wang Lu, and the secretary-general of the People's Party of China, Liu Zhiyuan, participated in the discussion.
In his 14 years of sports career, he won 18 world championships and became the first person in Chinese Olympic history to win four Olympic gold medals.
She remained first in the world for eight consecutive years, the longest female player in the history of table tennis ranking "first in the world".
On September 26, 2010, he was appointed Deputy Secretary-General of People's Daily and Managing Director of People's Search Network Company.
Today, she and Yu Min-hong will work together to create the country's first innovative entrepreneurial platform in the sports industry.
There is also a group of famous coaches in Chinese sports: they have won countless honours for the country in the age of athletes; after retirement, they have passed on their many years of learning to the latter and trained the Chinese champions.
As the first world champion of Chinese men's gymnastics, Huang Yubin retired after choosing to pick up the whip.
From the women's team coach to the men's team coach, and then to the general coach, Huang Yubin built a "Olympic gold team", and led the team in Beijing Olympics achieved 9 gold, 1 silver, 4 bronze mythical achievements.
Since then, he has been a prominent advertising spokesman, and in recent years has played important roles such as "Cowboy" and "Raifen".
Many NBA players have proven their strength, but some have made progress and others have fallen.
Whether due to age or due to time constraints, there are some players who step back every season.
Certainly, some of the “regressions” may be just a shrinking of the data, and the strength of these players may not be declining.
Even though Wade is still one of the league's top scoring backs, his performance with the Bulls shouldn't have been so hot.
He and Ludo have limited rebounds, and with a 32.8 percentage point lead from home star Bartlett, they will be crowded for next season's attack.
With Wind City coming, Lightning is likely to give more power to Bartle and Londo, who are likely to choose a life-sustaining game in the regular season.
Oscar's situation was more embarrassing, as the first choice for the 76ers of last season, he had to compete with Simons and Enfield for time and power in the new season.
The competition may not come soon, Simons will need to adapt to the NBA, and Enfield will need to recover from the injury as soon as possible, but whether Oscar will be in the 76ers' roster remains to be seen.
Last season, Okafor scored 32 per cent from low offense, higher than Cousins, Takevich, and Brooke Lopez, and his use rate was higher than the league's top 40.
With Simons already showing off his excellent controlling forward talent and Enfield with a better fit for the NBA game, Oscar's position is unlikely to be so stable.
Over the past two seasons, Thompson's performance has been stable at the top 20 of the league, and it has been his best two seasons in his career.
The problem, however, is that with Durand's arrival, Thompson's use rate is likely to decline, which will undoubtedly affect his performance.
This will not only affect the number of passes, but Tom's defensive strength will also be significantly reduced in the coming season, which in some respects will reduce his opponent's defensive difficulty.
The arrival of Durand is sure to cause the Warriors to shrink their numbers, but I'm afraid Thompson is the worst of them.
But that doesn't mean Tom's level has dropped, it's more like he's made a sacrifice for the team as a whole.
Parker performed better than the data last season, not only because his basketball efficiency came to the top of his career, but also because of the chemistry he and Aldrich used to benefit the Spurs.
Duncan retired, Ginobyl declared another year of war, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, as one of the youngest of the three, the French racing cars had no oil in their tanks.
After winning the third overall title, only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell beat James to win more regular season MVPs, and Jordan was the only MVP to beat James More.
Oh, yeah, James just brought Cleveland the first professional championship trophy in 52 years.
Coming into his 14th season in the career, James needed better physical strength to prepare for the playoffs.
As a result, in the regular season, James's figures are likely to decline further, and he will hand over more of the burden to Owen, but he will still easily become the top three player in the league.
"It is imperative that talents learnt from the country be developed in Russia."
The president of the Chinese Association of Chinese Expatriates in Moscow, Huang Zhen, said excitedly when he saw reporters from China News Network on December 12, local time.
Not long ago, she participated in a "Chinese talent (writing, painting) training course for overseas Chinese cultural societies" organized by the Office of Overseas Affairs of the State Council of China and sponsored by Jiangnan University.
When I was just taking the course, I didn't know where to start painting books, and after the course, I was able to paint and write my own works.
After returning to Moscow, you must make your contribution to the spread and promotion of Chinese culture by using the knowledge and skills you have learned.
At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Russian Association for the Promotion of Chinese Culture, Na Yan Wei, who attended the training course, had the same feeling.
She said she had made great progress with the help of the instructors in the training course, and she also felt a heavy responsibility as a "translator of Chinese culture overseas".
After returning to Russia, he said, he intends to spread and promote Chinese traditional culture among Chinese and Russians who love Chinese culture.
At 19:35 today, Chongqing power sail away to challenge Beijing's national security in a first-team match in the 22nd round of China Super League.
In the 29th minute, Wang Tong hit the goal, in the 39th minute, new incumbent Calderk scored the first goal with Fernando's assists, and in the 81st minute, Kunyan scored a goal.
Ten minutes after the match, the power sail was able to score a corner in a series of hits, and Fernando's small angle shot was blocked from the bottom by the national security line.
In the fifteenth minute, Zhang Shui Zheng took a straight pass in the midfield, El Maze had already rushed straight into the free zone, the single-player defense Liu Yu jumped out of the foot to destroy the ball.
One minute later, Parking was intercepted in front of the left-hand side of the road, and in the midfield of the Taibao ban zone, he swept off the right-hand side of the road without kicking the right-hand side, and the power sailmen took the ball away from Dun Xiaofee.
Fernando's right-handed forward, after a couple of passes, suddenly opened the door, and Calderk's front interception was thrown off by Le Danlon, who scored a point and presented Le Danlon with a yellow card.
In the 37th minute of the match, Zhang Xiaoping was replaced by Zhang Chiming, and Zhang Chiming played against the former manager.
Calderk got off the ball before the free zone, Fernando made a low pass on the left side of the free zone, and Calderk managed to push the goal.
It was also Calderk who scored in the semi-finals, 2–0 ahead.
In the second half, Fernando made a strong breakthrough to win the right-handed free throw, but it was a pity for him to hit the goal high from a small angle.
After Deng Xiaofei was denied the yellow card for delayed time, he was also denied the yellow card for a previous offense.
In the fifty-sixth minute, Zhang Chiming left-handed a pass with Zhang Shiretz, whose arc goal was blocked by Deng Xiaofei.
Liu Wu, a former banned area, violently struck and assaulted Cremetz, and he and emotionally excited Wang Dong successively gained the yellow card.
In the 63rd minute, Fernando's right-handed attack was knocked over by Clemens directly, and Fernando was very dissatisfied with Clemens' action, which led Clemens to the yellow card.
A minute later Fernando again demonstrated his ability to run on the right-hand side of the road, and he also won the yellow card in the Big Bao pursuit of offense rules.
The goal was scored by the referee, and the goal was scored by the referee, and the goal was scored by the referee, and the goal was scored by the referee.
In the 86th minute, Zhou made a right-handed pass, and Sergei Sergeyev made a surplus after a chest stop in the middle of the zone, and Dun Xiaofee pulled the ball out again with a fantastic save.
After a four-minute break, Rihan maintained a 2-1 win to the end of the match, defeating Guangdong on home ground.
After winning this valuable 3 points, Rihan's score now stands at 27 points, tenth in the provisional rankings.
Lehman will then be an expert on DFA Asia's media partners and participate in various local fan activities.
This autumn, German League Image Ambassadors Lehman and Matthews are expected to make a legendary journey to Asia and America to mark the opening of the 2016-17 season.
The event will take place across two continents, covering four top cities, and they will gather around the world with fans to prepare for the new season.
The German Football League (German: Deutsche Fußballliga) is one of the top five leagues in Europe (Premier League, Western League, Italian League, German Football League, French Football League) and is the flagship of German football.
As one of the most powerful leagues in the world, the 2014–15 season attracted around 1.3 million spectators to the stadium.
Germany's Bayern Munich, Dortmund, and famous stars such as Thomas Müller, Ramm, and Gertrude are well-known in China.
In conjunction with the Weibo, YouTube, and Weibo Chinese platforms that had previously been launched by Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Telekom hoped to provide Chinese fans with a broader and more convenient channel to get the latest news of the league.
The British team won silver in a seven-man rugby match, while the Fijian team won gold
In the seven-man final on Thursday night, the British failed to continue their impressive performance in front of Fiji, defeating Fiji 43–7 at Rio de Janeiro.
Fiji won the gold medal, the first Olympic medal in the country's history, for their unwavering performances in controlling, snatching, avoiding, co-ordinating, running and power.
The silver was also a small consolation for the defeated British team, which was the third British team to win that day, a victory enough to make the British football team proud: they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa in their first ever seven-man game at the Olympics.
Earlier that day, the British team risked defeating South Africa 7–5, which may have affected their position in the final.
But in any case, Fiji's current team is sufficient to defeat a spirited 15-man team.
Tomorrow, at least one Briton will wear a gold medal, which may be a consolation for the British team, but it may not be. The Briton is Ben Ryan, the former manager of the Fijian team from Wimbledon.
It is not easy for the British team to achieve today's results.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they failed to win the Adelaide International Sevens.
And now they are just a step away from the champion.
Although they have been hit hard, they have made remarkable progress.
Fiji took the lead at the start, making the British team unable to take any chances.
For Tom Mitchell and his teammates, it's like hitting a series of buses on the road.When O'Connor crossed the corner, the World Series champions were far ahead, 5-0.
Within four minutes of the game, Jerry Tuway scored again on the right wing.
12–0, the British team barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's strong blockade prevented Giants-like Leon Nakagawa from scoring a third, but that only slowed down the pace of Fiji's scoring.
At 7 minutes, Assa Valemaru made a right-handed touchdown. 17–0, a snowy start for the British.
Na carava scored another one, and the game had one minute left in the first half.
Then Watmo Lavoro defeated the British defence and went straight to the scoring line.
The score was 29-0 in the half-time break.
The Fijians were born to play seven-man football, while the British team was still the first to leave the country.
That's the way it is.
The British made a big change in the second half and hit Fiji's defence for a full four minutes, which was a good performance in the first half, but then the Fijians played a fantastic match and scored again by Joshua Tuesova.
Dan Norton created a score opportunity for the British team, who touched the left flank and changed the score to 36–7, but the game was already in the hands of the South China Islanders, whose fans sang loudly, waved flags, and danced.
The performance of the Fijian team has to be applauded with applause.
Martha Williams stopped the Fijians at the last minute for an unprecedented attack.
The final whistle rang, the Fijians embraced together, and the defeated British team could only regret their departure.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, while England risked defeating South Africa in a fierce semi-final match.
Kyle Brown helped the South African team to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton scored a good goal in the second half.
Afterwards, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, with a brilliant interception, secured the team's victory, and eventually the British team won the silver.
Helen Graves and Heather Stanning were encouraged by their cancer coach to win the boat gold
Without exaggeration, this is the most touching gold medal.
From the beginning of the first rowing, Helen Grave and Heather Stanning have undergone 220 punitive lifting exercises, and the gold medal they won at Estacio da Lagoa is of even greater significance.
Although only two of them were on board, the voice of another person on board, coach Robin Williams, accompanied them to the second consecutive Olympic gold medal for women's two-wheelers, the first British women's team to reach this height.
They have held a record of 39 unbeaten matches, with an absolute advantage.
What we saw was that the two talented athletes competed elegantly in the water, but that was not all of the victory.
There are many volunteers behind each boat gold medal, and it is their constant dedication that makes a difference, and the biggest of them is one who learned 30 months ago that he had cancer and didn't know if he could see the coach that day alive.
As he said, death could come at any time.
I got bladder cancer and they did surgery for me.
Without surgery, cancer cells will spread throughout the body.
In this way, the situation would be much worse.
This will change your opinion slightly.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Fortunately, he began treatment at the beginning of 2014, which would have a minimal impact on his health, although this may not be appropriate under the circumstances.
I need to get paid, so I have to get better quickly.
It's an inspiration to me.
I live in the hospital, and although they say a few steps is enough, I walk 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet around the hospital every time.
This is the starting point for everything.
Boat racing itself is a journey, which makes the journey a little longer.
At the moment of winning the gold, the first thing they thought about was Williams. This morning's Williams spoke a little bit more than usual, in order to overcome his anxiety.
"I'm in a bad mood this week, maybe a little extreme, but this gold medal is truly remarkable," she said, after returning to Afghanistan as head of the Royal Artillery Corps.
It repeatedly told me how important it was to me, how much effort I, Helen, and Robin had put into it.
Here's Helen, Robin and I for three years of hard work.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't have been an unknown lieutenant, and I'm very grateful to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a coach or coach better than him.
Helen Graves and Heather Stanning failed in five years.
The punishment set by the combination is unmatched by their opponents.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark started to approach, Stanning and Graham had plenty of physical reserves.
It was really exciting at the time.
Helen said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is very important not to be influenced by opponents.
We've got a good start, and we're not looking forward to doing something amazing.
We didn't think about the glory of today, we just thought about sailing every oar and winning the game, and we did.
The couple spent a year deciding their future.
She will marry TV explorer Steve Baxter next month.
But now, she just wants to enjoy the present.
I don't want to say this is my last game.
This would put too much pressure on me.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I felt very nervous.
It's been about four minutes now.
"I feel better," she said.

Bulgaria's first inflation in eight months
National statistics show that Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest inflation rate in years (since June 2012), and it broke zero for the first time since last October (0.2%).
Compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015), the average annual inflation rate for the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) (as measured by the consumer price index) was -0.8 per cent.
Compared to June 2016, the consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0 percent.
The inflation rate so far this year (July 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2 per cent, compared to July 2015, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2 per cent.
Compared to last month, prices for the following consumer goods rose in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), and other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices declined in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household electricity and maintenance (0.5%), and medical care (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, natural gas and other fuels, communications, and education were priced at the same level as last month.
Snapchat's "animation" effect is referred to as satirical for Asians
Snapchat said the filter was inspired by animation, but some observers believed it was racial.
Snapchat's 1.5 billion daily users can change reality by using its filter tools to make people look ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
These lens have the effect of blurring and bending, producing more than 3 million modified self-portraits every day.
Any mistake will be immediately noticed by the public.
Snapchat's lens has been criticized for using it to promote the role of a black person or the beauty of white skin.
Thus, when the app this week provided some users with a filter that could create slanted eyes, weird teeth, and powdered faces, some commentators called it an ethnic irony for Asian "yellow people".
They even wondered whether these recurring problems meant that the company had a bigger problem in diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard report on Wednesday sparked outrage after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company's explanation is that the filter is a tribute to cartoon characters, not a satire of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the filter reminds them of harmful stereotypes of reality.
Others also strongly opposed these cartoon images.
One Korean-American artist who tweeted about the photos and shared them widely said in an email that the filters were "at least embarrassing and uncomfortable".
"It's hard to distinguish between the effects of ultra-bad Asian satirical images and filters," she said.
Although it is not only yellow people in the filter, yellow people are extremely devalued.
Snapchat is not the only company to touch these cultural foundations.
From corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the equipment we carry around, American culture seems to have been advocating diversity and inclusiveness.
Snapchat’s large youth group may be more sensitive to racial diversity than its older generation.
When a Snapchat filter created an image of insulting users, 25-year-old Julie said in an interview Thursday, "It's harder to escape people's eyes than it used to be.
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article written for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed the racial controversy reflected the lack of racial diversity in Snapchat's recruitment process.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's majority of employees as white, the leadership as male, and added a tag at the end of the article: #DeleteSnapchat.
As a Chinese-American, Ms. Zhu said, "It's either because they don't have all kinds of people of color that they can make such a decision, or because they have some people of color, but their jobs don't allow them to say anything."
Other observers shared complaints that she had not been responded to by Snapchat.
The company has not released data on employee diversity and says it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss its employees' ethnic background on Thursday, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter specializing in dealing with low-income groups and promoting internal inclusion.
Ms. Zhu said she would close her Snapchat account: "I wonder if they need more users like us to oppose this behavior.
Congress says military officials distorted ISIS's intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional group noted that U.S. Central Command officials had changed their intelligence reports to describe the situation in Iraq and Syria's war against the Islamic State more optimistically than in reality.
The mid-term report comes from a special working group of the Republican chairman of the House Military Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the House Appropriations Committee's Department of Defense Subcommittee, which said there was "widespread dissatisfaction" with Central Command intelligence analysts who said senior officials were manipulating their assessments of the war between the United States and the Islamic State.
The Central Command (Centcom) in Tampa, Florida is the military headquarters responsible for overseeing US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia region.
According to a report on the report, "information reviewed by senior commanders of the Central Command is more optimistic about the description of U.S. counter-terrorism operations than the reality and is always more optimistic about the analysis of other intelligence agencies."
"The actions of the Central Command are unacceptable," a Republican representative from California said. "On the one hand, our soldiers are suffering from war and on the other, senior policymakers are getting the wrong analysis.
The leadership problem of the Central Command has been extended to the highest levels of the institution.
The report details the long-standing problems experienced by the Central Command in describing and analysing U.S. military training in Iraq in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered changes to these reports, according to the report, these analysts felt they were under pressure from heads of the Central Command, forcing them to express a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (ISIS or ISIS).
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and Congressional testimony were much more optimistic than in reality," the report said.
For example, a Central Command official has publicly stated that a large-scale military operation to recapture Mosul may take place as early as April or May 2015.
The second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
"The results have been very clear after months of investigation," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompey said in a statement.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, most senior intelligence officials at the Central Command of the United States controlled the intelligence products of the Command, concealing the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq.
The Republicans set up a special working group after they learned from analysts that information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
As the investigation continues, more discoveries will follow the report released on Thursday.
The Chief Prosecutor of the Ministry of Defence also conducted a long-term investigation into the Central Command.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their findings Thursday, in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Special Task Force.
In a statement on behalf of the committee's Democratic leader, Shenda, the Central Command developed an overly narrow process for intelligence assessments of the Islamic State and Iraqi peacekeeping forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Sheanda said the process "obstructs the release of information", reduces the morale of analysts and "cannot accept different opinions".
But he and the Democrats also said they did not find any evidence to support the White House's attempts to exert pressure on Central Command analysts, thus making their conclusions "prejudiced or political".
The Wildlife Daily reported on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported that after receiving complaints from Central Command analysts, the Prosecutor General of the Pentagon began an investigation.
Pentagon spokesman Major General Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress report until the Prosecutor General's investigation was completed.
But he said, "Experts sometimes disagree about the interpretation of complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence encourage healthy dialogue on these important national security topics."
The impact of the investigation has exceeded the question of whether US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria have been successful (as claimed by more and more defence officials).
But last year, these claims raised questions about how much President Barack Obama could trust the Central Command’s assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of controversy over a decade ago, when Central Command intelligence analyst Gregory Huck wrote a study pointing out that George W. Bush's government, despite the opposition of many analysts, insisted on sending small-scale troops to Iraq and barely considered the situation after the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Huck played a key role in this campaign against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said Mr. Huck's team concluded that the air strikes against the Islamic State refinery did not significantly reduce the terrorist organization's economic income, as the terrorist organization had built temporary refineries to continue selling oil in the black market, which was in stark contrast to the statements made.
According to Time magazine's September report, the Central Command did not publish the findings outside the country.
Central Command Commander Lloyd Austin III was criticized last year after several lawyers examined Senate testimony about overly optimistic assessments of the war.
General Austin retired in April and is now replaced by Joseph Walter in his central command.
The United States won four straight matches in the women's hockey competition and will lose one to Britain
Katie Bam, a three-pointer in a 6–1 victory over Japan, took the lead for the US women's hockey team on Thursday, helping the US beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two matches were a staggering four, but 27-year-old Pam said she didn't know she was doing so well.
"I don't know anything about it," she said.
I'm not the kind of guy who remembers throwing a few balls.
She knows that the United States have won four consecutive games in the Olympics and will be in the first group with the unbeaten England after defeating Japan 2–0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States faced each other narrowly in Saturday's first round final.
Both teams advance to the quarterfinals, which will determine who will appear first in the group.
The team that gets first in the group will avoid encountering the powerful Dutch team, which will be able to go further. The Dutch team is on the line as first in another group.
In Saturday's game, the US team created a miracle with an amazing performance. You know, four years ago at the Olympics in London, the US team came to the bottom of 12 teams.
Sam was on that team at the time.
She grew up in Brooklyn, Pennsylvania, where she first picked up the hockey stick at the age of three (her twin sister played it in Dereksel) and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of the national team to date.
Unable to qualify for the finals, she missed the 2008 Olympics.
In 2012, she and her teammates were not well received.
In the second year, England's Craig Panam became the coach, and things started to change.
"It's a cultural, mental and substantive change," he said.
We were not at our current level in London at the time.
We've come to a complete overhaul.
On Thursday night, Barm took the lead in the first half by scoring a near-handed rebound.
India hadn't won the game yet, but the team showed an amazing tenacity and scored a 1–0 victory just before the end of the third period, when the boom broke out.
She took the ball a long way to the left of the court, then cut into the middle of the road, pulling into the net, the United States 2–0 ahead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
American goalkeeper Jackie Bridges scored his first zero goal in the game, winning the first three games.
This time she's playing an extraordinary role.
Sam, too.
"We're in good shape right now," said Panam, but how good it is depends on the results of Saturday's game.
Cold acid food during the Great Depression
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who had just been elected president, sat in the presidential office for lunch.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt likes the foods of Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver sauce and marinated seafood.
That day, his menu was very simple: tomato sauce devil eggs, soybean flour and a hearty fruit pudding.
Jean Ziegler said, "It's to share the pain in food with people who are suffering.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It also reflects the way Americans eat.
The couple, who live in the Brooklyn Highlands, are both food historians.
One of Mr. Coe's books, "Chickened Rambles," is about Chinese food in the United States, while Mrs. Ziegler, in her book "97 Fruit Gardens," tells the story of the lives of tenants in the slums through food.
Their new book, The Great Dining, will be published by Harper Press on Tuesday, describing the food history of the United States during the Great Depression.
After exhibiting some common ideas on food, they met a reporter at the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a simple lunch counter in the iron area that has been in business since the economic downturn of 1929.
Mrs. Ziegman, 54, served a cream cheese with a broken olive sandwich, while Mr. Coe, 57, served chicken, potatoes and vegetable dishes.
The couple found the dishes suitable for discussing the diet of the Great Depression, when reporters ordered a roll of baked meat.
"The bread was very popular at the time," said Mrs. Ziegler.
There was flower bread, liver bread, soybean bread.
They are all made of one kind of raw material and one kind of cheap watering head that can be poured on the raw material.
Imagine that your dinners are all flowers.
Mr. Coe is a strange figure.
They must be like lead in your stomach, he said.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, Americans ate all-you-can-eat meals, especially in the suburbs.
A group of women cooked for the men on the farm, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner they had newly cooked pies.
During the First World War, it was the Americans who gave food to the hungry Europeans. The Great Foods documented how the country suddenly ceased to be a rich country.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife were writing the book: "At that time, food was the main topic that made Americans uncomfortable.
Another unpleasant topic is the cold-acid new foods: "sweet foods" such as bread and stewed vegetables have become staples, and stewed vegetables are "the best way to cook leftovers," said Ms. Ziegler, because chefs can use cream in sauces to cover up unpleasant ingredients.
Fresh fruit is replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has been a staple on American tables for years, has become a rare luxury.
The strange big juicy is just about calories, and nutrition is more important than taste, or even basic cooking habits.
In the course of studying the book, including various recipes, Mrs. Ziegler made a roast onion full of vegetable oil.
"This is not common at dinner tables," Mr. Coe said.
"It's too strange," said Mrs Ziegler.
Vegetable oil and roast onions can't be combined.
This is the characteristic of many family economic meals.
Family economists who influenced the country's eating habits, such as Louis Stanley, who served as the head chef of the Federal Household Economics Office from 1923 to 1943, are unique in history.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, encouraging women to "slice and dice" and bravely transform bad foods such as creamy pasta and carrots into delicacies.
The Great Dining is a rich "historic dish".
Particularly interesting is the government’s response to hungry people, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I can’t take care of others.”
Although he publicly praised his simple love of farming as a child, his diet was as sophisticated as that of a millionaire.
"He likes to eat Western dishes like fish with guava sauce," Mr. Coe said.
He was dressed in an evening dress and ate in a gold plated restaurant.
He clearly broke away from the people.
President Roosevelt may have made the same mistake without his wife, Eleanor, encouraging him to set an example in his diet.
As the book says, Ms. Roosevelt's managers are not interested in taste, so "the food in the White House is not only Washington's hardest to eat, it's the worst to cook."
When America returned to normality, many of the cooking methods of the Great Depression were abandoned.
"What's left is our focus on calories and nutrition and the application of science to cooking," she said.
The couple said that while writing the book, they learned more about Mrs. Ziegler's mother's eating habits, such as how to avoid wasting food.
She is very afraid of wasting food, Mr. Coe said.
Mrs. Ziegler recalls, "She's actually made many lives sick.
For example, there has been a "Cream Bubble" incident.
After removing the dish, she and Mr. Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: this was President Roosevelt's fruit pudding for lunch.
"It's called "Creme Juice," said Mrs. Ziegman, adding that a new name for a common dish is "Traditional Tricks".
There was no cream in the dessert, only the plum, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone pushed the spoon into the thick brown paste with difficulty.
Surprisingly, the dessert tastes good.
Mr. Coe ate the second and third spoons.
He thought it was a delicious treat, so he told his wife, "A little more crushed nuts will taste better."
Unfortunately, OPEC's latest monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to rise in July, with Saudi production reaching a new high.
The report raises doubts about OPEC's credibility, and the road to a recovery in oil prices is still fraught with difficulties.
OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on 26-28 September, Chairman-in-Office and Minister of Energy of Qatar, Mr. Sada, said Monday.
OPEC's Monthly Report released on Wednesday showed production in July rose by 4.6 million barrels per day across the entire OPEC group, including Gabon, to 33.1 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have driven global refineries to produce more refined oil products, thereby exacerbating market surpluses.
International oil prices fell for two consecutive days amid the news, coupled with higher US oil production expectations and unexpected increases in oil stocks.
As of Wednesday's close, the New York Commodity Exchange's light crude futures price fell 2.48 per cent in September and 2.07 per cent in October for the London Brent crude futures price.
Reuters believes the proposed meeting of the oil-producing countries is unlikely to lead to a significant contraction in supplies, and data released by the U.S. Department of Energy Information has also put pressure on the market.
Iran's daily crude oil production reached 38 million barrels, the highest level since 2008, Iran's official news agency Fars quoted Iran's oil minister Zanggerini as saying Wednesday.
As soon as news of the meeting surfaced, Russian Energy Minister Nikolay Novak said there was no need for a new round of freeze talks under current oil prices.
The last meeting of oil-producing countries was held in April, and OPEC members failed to reach agreement on any measures.
Emma Richards, a BMIResearch analyst for oil and gas, says markets and the media may be overreacting to the OPEC conference.
"OPEC is changing market sentiment by releasing signals that they will facilitate the agreement," said Helena Croft, chief commodity strategy officer at the Royal Bank of Canada.
It's like a smoke and a mirror (who deliberately gives the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, head of commodity research at the German Commercial Bank, said it was unlikely that OPEC would attempt to stabilize the markets through the September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine market confidence in OPEC, which, after all, has performed a "wolf come and go" show.
The focus should be on unlawfully publishing medical advertisements, concentrating complaints and focusing on medical institutions that have already been punished several times.
The National Health and Livelihood Commission and the National Central Medicine Authority will organize in good time to oversee the implementation of the special supervision and inspection work in some provinces.
According to media reports, as capital plunged into Internet pharmaceuticals on a massive scale, causing serious problems with product homogenization, the investment surge has receded and capital is entering the peak.
In addition, according to data from the Hong Kong Institute for the Management of Elippi Hospital, about 20 per cent of the first Internet medical companies have disappeared in the first year of starting up.
Yet, just as most Internet-based medical enterprises struggle on a round-A or round-B financing path, a few of the sector’s leading companies are still able to capitalize.
It seems that Internet healthcare entrepreneurship must not be "a hive of bees," but rather look at market demands, devote your heart to specialty, to deep.
Fish jump funded 12 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, Kyushu Instruments Company funded 18 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital.
In recent years, with the state's policy support in the field of medical information, the electronicized and integrated supply chain management system has gradually entered hospitals at all levels.
This cooperation with Kyushu-tong is aimed at market demands, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management systems, and seeking more cooperation as an opportunity.
Unlike many Internet medical companies, iBaby was originally focused on the vertical domain of Internet obstetrics, deeply cultivating both mothers and doctors.
Mothers can not only get free 24-hour and one-on-one appointments with their supervisors, but also pay for appointments.
At the doctor's side, iBaby breaks the regional limits by taking the form of organizing specialists to give online lectures to grass-roots doctors, peer-to-peer exchanges, case discussions, and so on.
At present, there are three platforms at the doctor's side, namely doctors' continuing education, doctors' socialization and doctors' requests for help.
Providing services including online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social platforms between hospitals and doctors in the same departments, legal assistance and support for entrepreneurship needed in doctor-patient relationships or personal life.
According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali's health "will be willing to sink in" to take health big data.
Internet companies and data companies lack professionalism and do not achieve uniformity in the way they write on the same article.
Ali is currently divided into three units in the field of medical health: Ali Health, Tian Cat Medical Center and Paybo Future Hospital.
Wang Lei admits that healthcare entrepreneurship will be more difficult than other industries, "It's not just a matter of how much money you have, it's also a matter of humility, enduring loneliness, and doing it slowly.
Keeping up at night watching the Olympics can hurt your heart
The Brazilian Olympic Games are going on like wildfire, and even if they are broadcast at midnight in the country, many citizens will watch them all night long.
In this regard, the doctors especially reminded that there are health risks of staying up at night to watch the event, which could lead to cardiovascular disease.
If you spend a long time at night, the hormone is still secreted in large quantities, and people experience a constant state of tension and excitement, not being able to recover normally, which can cause vascular contraction and elevated blood pressure, leading to cardiovascular disease.
In particular, he warned that people with cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, smoking habits, and family history could be more likely to develop cardiovascular disease if they stayed up late at night.
If you stay long at night, not only your cardiovascular function is affected, but also your gastrointestinal, immune, and neuroendocrine functions are affected, and your risk of developing cancer is even higher.
For elderly friends, Han recommends not to spend the night watching the Olympics, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease.
During the last World Cup football game, Mr. Han visited a patient over the age of 60 whose heart attack was caused or related to watching the game overnight.
Since this year, his department has treated some 25-year-olds with myocardial infarctions or strokes, largely due to their long-term overnight lifestyle, Mr. Han said.
Don't spend the night every day or watch your favorite sports occasionally. Other sports can wait for the next match to be broadcast.
When you stay awake at night, you should take more fruit, which can prevent vascular blockages and strengthen your immunity.
The 2016 Rio Olympics women's 50m rifle three-position finals were held in Beijing, China, on August 12, 2016 and the bronze medal was won by China's oldest athlete, Duli.
Duli became the fourth Olympic grandmaster, winning two gold, one silver and one bronze medals in four Olympics.
In 1998, he joined the Shooting Team of Shandong Province and trained as a professional shooter with coach Wang Dewen.
In June 2003, she won the gold medal in the women's 10 metre gas pistol at the Croatian World Cup and broke the world record with 504.9 rounds.
In August 2004, she won the gold medal in the women's 10 metre gas pistol for the Chinese national team at the Athens Olympics.
In August 2008, he won the gold medal in the 50 metres athletic rifle triathlon, breaking the Olympic record by a total of 690.3 rounds.
In August 2012, after the London Olympics, Duli filed for temporary retirement with the International Shooting Federation.
In January 2015, Duly announced that he would return to the national team to begin training for the Rio Olympics.
In March 2016, at the end of the Rio Olympics, she again qualified for the Women's 10m Gas Rifle Olympics eight years later.
On August 6, 2016, at the Rio Olympics, Duli won the silver medal in the women's 10 metre gas pistol event with 207 rounds.

The film is expected to premiere on Central Television and MTV in early May, and will also be the first to be released in a full-length VR video.
The documentary Polaris is a large-scale film focused on the Third Polar Plateau of the Earth. It tells the story of the interweaving of Tibetan tradition with modernity and Tibet's interaction with the world from a new perspective.
The greatest advantage of VR works is that they give the audience a unique viewing "diving" feeling, which also raises higher demands on the filming process.
The video crew of the Extreme Full-Screen VR special said they wanted to make sure that every aspect of the screen was unbiased to give the viewer a sense of the situation.
On 11 August, Special Snipers organized by the Shandong Gendarmerie's Yantai Branch came to Mt. Kun to train in the jungle at a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union delivered missiles to Cuba, almost leading to a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
The event was viewed as the culmination of the Cold War, and was dubbed the "Cuba Missile Crisis".
But it is unknown that, just as during the Cold War, a powerful solar storm also risked causing the United States to launch a nuclear war against the Soviet Union, an event that was not first reported outside by researchers until August 9.
On May 23, 1967, a powerful solar storm caused severe interference with radar and radio communications at the Arctic.
These radars are part of the U.S. ballistic missile warning system used to monitor Soviet missiles.
The paper, which was completed by researchers at the University of Colorado, interviewed U.S. officials who were involved in forecasting and analyzing solar activity at the time and examined non-confidential documents.
In the 1960s, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from launching a sudden nuclear war, the U.S. Air Force used to fly a number of warplanes carrying nuclear bombs in the sky, the paper wrote.
The commander of the U.S. Army did not know that the cause of the disturbance was the solar storm, not the Soviet Union, and ordered the aircraft to be placed in combat-ready condition.
Fortunately, the U.S. military’s research into solar activity, which began in the late 1950s, and its study of Earth’s electromagnetic interference, ultimately prevented this potential military conflict.
Later, he summarized the information provided by the U.S. Air Force Meteorological Service and submitted a detailed report.
The direct consequence of the solar storm was that the U.S. military viewed space weather as a combat concern and established a stronger space weather forecasting system.
Citizens who find their loved one's car blocked by a strange vehicle on their daily trips can use the "WeChat Move Car" feature to solve the problem if they can't contact a strange driver.
On 11 August, the Xi'an Police Service's Weibo service called "X'an Police Service" launched the "WeChat Diversion" service.
Following the introduction of the service, citizens can solve such problems in everyday life if they encounter a strange vehicle obstructing their own vehicle while the driver is not on the scene by using the "WeChat Move Vehicle" function.
The new service functions are: one, faster, saving administrative costs; two, respecting and protecting citizens' personal privacy; and three, all-weather, all-time service.
As long as citizens have a WeChat, it can be very conveniently operated by themselves, this way can relatively make both sides of the carriage can be more friendly and easy to "meet", alleviate the problem of parking difficulty, and can reduce the incidents of traffic involving the security.
On the other hand, for drivers who refuse to move, unlawfully stop or obstruct traffic, the Xi'an Transportation Authority said that police officers will take different measures according to the actual situation, depending on the situation.
On August 9, more than 10 young workers from the Shanghai Power Supply Company came to the cultural tourism area of Donghua Old Town in Tangfeng County to carry out the "Soyo Old Town is full of electricity" and our festival and evening theme activities.
Commercial Power Supply Company Dan Feng County Company, in conjunction with the work of spiritual civilization construction, actively organized the "Soyo old town full of electricity" and our festival and evening theme activities.
"I spend most of my time at work and study, and I don't have the time and platform to communicate with my colleagues and friends," said employees at the company.
"This company has provided us with such a relaxing, happy and harmonious platform, which I love, meaningful and enjoyable.
The event received widespread praise from the youth workers on the scene, who hoped the company would organize more such events in the future, and strengthen communication and exchange with more other youth.
Concerned Beijing Olympics men's singles champion, Spanish giant Nadal on the day in the men's singles match fell two sets to victory opponents advance to the eighth place, the men's doubles match also advance to the final.
As a gold medalist, Nadal has a passion for the Olympics, and he has not recovered from the injury, this three-line shootout, defeated quite well.

Kovitova will compete with Pyg for a final ticket, while another final seat will be created between Kess and Kobel.
The four strongest women's doubles matches were also produced, with the semi-finals matches being played by Singhis/Basinski against Heratka/Hravakova, and Makarova/Vesnina against Strikova/Safarova.
The mixed-double match that took place that day also won the eighth place, but the loss of the first seed Mahu/Gasia team, as well as the defeat of the Na豆 team, made the mixed-double match somewhat disappointing.
On April 27, 2015, the United States and Japan jointly released a new version of the U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Pointer, allowing Japan's armed forces to play a more offensive role globally.
This was the day U.S. Defense Secretary Carter, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and Japanese Defence Minister Yutaka Nakatani attended a press conference in New York.
This is the fifth time the Chinese People's Library has published an assessment of Japanese military capabilities, and the fourth time the English version has been released.
The report is divided into nine chapters, including general policy adjustment, military strength, defence budget, military deployment, weapons and equipment, institutional reform, military training, foreign military security cooperation, and military security relations with China.
According to the report, 2015 was the year of the Abe administration's phased adoption of major policy adjustments in the area of security for several years in a row.
Since then, Japan’s actions in the field of security will mainly be at the operational level, such as the application of the law, the implementation of strategies, and the implementation of policies, rather than the drastic adjustment and change of frameworks, mechanisms, and policies.
The report emphasizes that Abe's cabinet has sought to achieve the multiple objectives of promoting Japan's "normal nationalization" through the above-mentioned three breakthroughs, the withdrawal of the Self-Defense Forces from international security, the strengthening of the U.S.-Japan alliance, and the defence of China over China.
Previously, the China Strategy Culture Promotion Council issued the Japan Military Force Assessment Report on June 5, 2012, July 19, 2013, July 23, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
The Financial Times published a series of photographs of the US embassy in China on August 12.
In contrast, the article says, the U.S. embassy's residence, from the appearance, can be used as a safe house in the next movie, which is adapted from the Cold War spy novel by John Le Carré.
The official residence is grey, and is heavily guarded by an outer fence, a second-floor inner wall, a barbed wire fence, and a vehicle barrier layer.
Completion of Public Sports Facilities Shortlist
The black coalfield warehouses became the green grass football field; the factories on the top of the red brick turned into modern sports stadiums.
On People's Fitness Day, Hangzhou's Southern Horseback Riding Sports and Culture Park outside the River Gate unveiled a mysterious veil.
It used to be a coal mine, but after its closure more than a decade ago it remained vacant, leaving a large number of illegal buildings and rubbish.
After the renovation, it became a sports and cultural park, and will be officially opened in November, providing free sports venues to the citizens, and undoubtedly opens a new ground for all-round sports.
This reminds us of Hangzhou Chen Chen Polyester Sports School, the Chinese swimming arena's "Huang Po Military School" has won several world championships.
The name of the swimming arena will come from source to source continuously, lively interprets the relationship between athletic sports and all-people sports--the rich mass base provides good conditions for selecting professional athletes.
The level of athletic sport is closely related to the basis of all sports. In a certain sense, athletic sport depends on all sports, and all sports depend on the conditions of the field.
It is reported that, as of 2015, China's per capita area of sports grounds is 150 times larger than at the time of the founding of the new China, but still far behind the sports-powered country.
In June of this year, the State Council issued the People's Fitness Plan (2016-2020), which will focus on the development of mass sport.
In order to complete this short board, on the one hand, the relevant departments should take full account of the layout of the gymnasium when carrying out urban planning.
On the other hand, public sports venues, including those in units such as schools, which have already been built, should be opened as widely as possible and be used as efficiently as possible.
The current Rio Olympics, which are going on like a fireworks display, have stimulated people's enthusiasm for sports and have awakened everyone's sense of participation.
Gilead gets a lawyer's fee in a patent dispute with Merck over hepatitis C
According to a U.S. District Judge's ruling, Gilead Science has the right to receive attorneys' fees in patent proceedings against the pharmaceutical company Merck Group for hepatitis C.
In June, after U.S. judges discovered Merck's illegal activities, including forgery and other immoral acts, Gilead was exempted from paying $2 billion in compensation for Gilead's best-selling drugs, Sophibwe and Harvey, for violating Merck's two patents.
In Thursday's lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Bes Lambson Freeman said Gilead did not have to bear the costs of the defence.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead on the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of hepatitis patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, both claiming to be the owners of one of Gilead’s active ingredients – Sophibwe’s laboratory work.
US-backed troops announced they had regained control of the province from the Islamic State
A spokesman for the force said Friday that all remaining Islamist soldiers in the city had left and that US-backed troops had taken full control of the northern city of Manbidi near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the militants fled to hide inside.
The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance's Manbidi military commissioner, Salah Darvish, told Reuters that they had rescued more than 2,000 civilians abducted by militants.
"Manbi season is now under our control, but we're still cleaning up," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $175 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax
Hillary Clinton released her 215-year tax return Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $175 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
In 2015, the Clintons made $1 million in charitable donations, most of which went to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton's lecture fees amounted to nearly $53 million, while the former Secretary of State received $3 million from publishers Simon and Schuster for a book on her tenure on the State Council.
Clinton's campaign partner, Virginia Senator Tim Cain, and his wife Annie Holton released a 10-year tax return.
The couple paid 20.3% of the federal tax in 2015.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement that Hillary Clinton and Tim Cain would continue to be financially transparent.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump covers up for false reasons and reclaims the commitments he made before to disclose tax returns.
Although the law does not require it, it is customary for US presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns.
As a New York businessman, Trump and his lawyer cited the US Treasury Board’s audit as the reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, said on Twitter that you were in charge, and added a link to the Democratic candidate's tax return.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax returns before the audit was completed.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, said Trump's refusal to disclose tax returns would raise questions about his net capital value, charitable contributions, business transactions, and various other relationships, including with Russia.
Seizing the issue, Clinton released a web video Friday that highlighted high-profile Democrats urging Trump to announce his tax status.
On Thursday, she raised the issue in a speech on Michigan's economic policy.
For decades, he refused to publish his tax returns, as did other presidential candidates, she told the crowd.
According to the Politician News Network, Trump paid almost no more than a penny of tax in the 1990s for two years, and the New York Times business columnist cited several tax attorneys and accountants on Friday, all of whom said the situation may still be the same.
Federal taxes have become a major issue in the presidential campaign.
Clinton named a provision named Warren Buffett, a billionaire investor, to ensure that people earning more than $100 million a year pay at least 30% of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Clinton held a rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Berkshire Hathaway is based, and Buffett asked Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an IRS audit, and that Trump was “fearing” not the tax authorities, but the voters.
The earliest tax returns issued by the Clinton campaign group were in 2007.
The average federal tax rate paid by the Clintons living in Chicago between 2007 and 2014 was about 32 per cent, and the combined tax rate was about 40.5 per cent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns show that, unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in wages.
Their main investments are low-cost index mutual funds, and the Clintons earn $109,000 in dividends and interest.

Jewish filmmakers criticize Berlin hotels for removing Israeli phone codes at Arab customers' "requests" - Reuters News
A French filmmaker of Jewish descent revealed to the media that the Berlin-based hotel "Kabinsky" did not list Israeli telephone codes, and the hotel staff said it was in line with the "requirements" of Arab customers, prompting a public outcry.
The author of the Holocaust documentary The Holocaust, Conrad Landsmann, expressed his disappointment with the Cabinsky Hotel and issued an open letter in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
During his recent stay, Lanzman wanted to find Israel on the phone code list provided by the hotel.
But Israel is not in the list of countries where guests can speak directly from their rooms.
Why did Israel disappear in Germany’s capital, Berlin, in 2016?
Randomman wrote.
Instead, guests can make Israeli calls through the call centre at the Kempinski Hotel.
To find an explanation, the filmmaker asked the front desk of the hotel.
Lanzman said in the letter that he was "shocked" by the response he received on the front row.
"This is a deliberate decision by the management of the hotel," hotel officials said.
And the reason for doing so is that the filmmaker is angry.
Lanzman quoted the employee as saying: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they asked for the Israeli code to be deleted."
According to the South German Daily, Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jacob Hadass-Handelsman called the incident "a disgraceful insult".
We were very surprised to learn of this incident.
It is a huge disgrace in itself.
And what happened in Germany and that chain hotel is even more disgraceful.
There is no explanation for this.
"We hope the hotel can come to the right conclusion," the official said.
The incident has sparked controversy on the Internet and is widely believed to be a scandal.
Some believed that the Cabinsky Hotel was simply "bowing and kneeling" to meet the demands of Arab customers.
Another post directly referred to the hotel as "not a face" and pointed out that the main street of the well-known Kudam Street was near a Jewish church.
According to Mirror Weekly, the hotel quickly clarified all the allegations, claiming everything was "irresponsible" and apologizing to Lanceman.
The South Daily quoted Kevinsky's representative as saying, "No direct order has ever been given to remove Israel from the rapid dial-up list."
The report also stated that Israeli code had been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students in São Paulo, Brazil, clashed with police as they protested the government's reform of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to expel protesters.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas as law enforcement officials tried to disperse the students.
Hundreds of students took part in the march, expressing their dissatisfaction with the programmes.
In order to save money, Governor Oakman plans to close 100 public schools and relocate 300,000 students.
Some of the students who took part in the protest expressed their dissatisfaction with interim President Michelle Temer through graffiti on the walls.
Just a few days before a recent protest, protesters collectively took to the streets in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who has been impeached by the State Senate.
Scottish cyclist Karl Skinner returns to fame after winning a gold medal in cycling
Scottish cyclist Karl Skinner last night helped the British team defend the gold medal after the 2012 London Olympics in the men's group race at the Rio cycling arena.
The 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist replaced his Scottish compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, and became the team's centre of gravity. Even the legendary cyclist was proud of him when the younger Skinner defeated the top-ranked New Zealand team and returned with honour.
Four years ago, the British team was shocked when Hoy won the fifth of six individual Olympic gold medals.
The British team finished sixth in the World Singles Field Championships in London in March, and Hay has since retired. Then the British team made a comeback.
During the period between the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympics, the problem for the British team was to replace "first-round expert" Jamie Starf.
That's what the team did when Hinds showed up.
Hoy's retirement also left a gap, and Jean Imadi and Matt Clapton both wanted to fill that gap.
Seeing Skinner's potential, the British men's coaches insisted that he be inducted into the national team, and Skinner did not end up in disappointment.
Skinner's teammates, Sunders and Kenny, who won gold four years ago with Hoye, broke the Olympic record in qualifying, but were overtaken by New Zealand in the first round.
The three British cyclists eventually defeated their opponents and won the gold medal.
Despite a little lagging behind, Kenny took the lead for the team, and Skinner kept that lead to the end.
The change in strategy was the key to this reversal, with Hinds choosing larger wheels and therefore slower speeds, which enabled Kenny, especially Skinner, to maintain the speed.
He watched the match as a BBC commentator and was seen by Skinner, Kenny and Sanders as they climbed onto the podium.
"I'm stunned by this," said 23-year-old Glasgow cyclist Skinner.
I'm just doing my best to make myself famous.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champion.
It's unbelievable.
Nothing is better than this victory.
After winning gold medals with Kenny and Hoyt at the 2012 Olympics in London, Hinds admitted to deliberately falling onto the track in a bad start.
Later, he withdrew the comment, and the British team's opponents were unable to appeal.
And this victory has no such problem.
"It's like in London, the stands are all British flags," said Hinds.
We were only in the team three months ago.
We have lost many world champions, so it is surprising to be able to defend the Olympic champions.
This is just one game, one gold for the British team, which won seven of the ten cycling gold medals at the Beijing and London Olympics.
If this represents the progress we have made over the past five months, then we will continue to be successful at the bicycle shop over the next five days.
According to Kenny's state of play, it is not unlikely that he will be able to return to Hoy's three-golden-medal feat at one Olympics.
If so, Kenny, who is 12 years younger than Hoy and is also born on 23 March (which seems to be the sacred day of British sports, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also born on that day), will have six golds and one silver.
This score is equal to that of Hoye.
Kenny will then compete in a three-day race starting today.
"I'm going to focus on the game for a while," said the 28-year-old Bolton.
Team games are always the best.
You can win the game with your teammates.
Frankly, a man who wins is a little lonely.
"If he wins two more gold medals, he should be awarded the Sirs' Seal," said Hinds.
It was the only game that produced medals that day, but the British team received other good news.
Sir Bradley Wilkins, Ed Cransey, Steven Burke, and Owen Doer advanced to the four-kilometer group race with the fastest results.
Their score was 351.943.
The world record for the 2012 London Olympic gold medal was 351,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place on today's second match day, and Wilkins will undoubtedly be the spotlight.
Yesterday he had a quarrel with the competition officials before qualifying, when the competition officials asked him to measure his height.
In the women's group match, which is due to end tomorrow, Laura Trot, Joanna Rotherschild, Eleanor Buck and Kate Archer of Milwaukee will advance to a new world record of 413.260.
The British team relied on their strong field cyclists to take the lead in the middle of the Olympics and win many medals.
After demonstrating its absolute dominance at the Beijing and London Olympics, the British cyclists were somewhat disappointed on their way to Rio.
There were many setbacks during this period, including the resignation in April of technical director Sean Sutton on charges of gender discrimination and bullying, and the retirement of legendary figures such as Hoye and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night at the bicycle shop was enough to prove the legend that the British team would once again perform at a crucial moment to reach its peak.
After little life has come into the world, fathers and mothers will be responsible for this life, not only for the health of the child, but also for the development of the spirit, that is, education.
If the education of children fails, then even if the career succeeds again, it will not be able to compensate for the shortcomings of life and the failure of the family.
When a new life is born, new parents need to spend time looking after and educating their children and taking responsibility for them.
Responsibility, in addition to health care, is also a spiritual education, that is to say, learning how to be human, how to grow up, how to succeed.
A good family education means that parents need to accompany their children on a regular basis, care for them with love and patience, and also to teach them to develop a civilized manner of speaking and behavior, and to teach them to learn better knowledge and improve their intelligence.
Parents' words and deeds will affect their children's growth, and they will imitate their parents, which is what people often call dragon-born dragon, foam-born foam, the mouse's son will dig a hole, what the parents are, what the children are.
So parents need to set a good example in front of their children, regulate their own actions, cultivate their own excellent qualities, which can indirectly help the child to shape a good heart and make him better.
Amy is a smart and pretty girl.
She has a lively personality, can get along well with her friends, and is good at adapting to the environment.
But Amy had a little secret in her heart: she couldn't spend much time concentrating on her study and work assignments.
This secret has accompanied Amy for a long time. Normally, the problem is not serious.
Even through distributed, modular time to learn and work, she can basically accomplish tasks and achieve good results.
But when the task is heavy and the time is tight, Amy feels very painful and tormented.
The object of individual resistance to self-exposure and emotional experience is not to threaten individual self-knowledge and self-esteem.
Some behaviorist psychologists also view resistance as an individual's disobedience to behavioral correction.
I tried to get Amy to do a practice where she calms herself down by breathing and relaxing and feeling the pain.
And once she left the trapped situation, she felt relaxed and free again.
A 63-year-old wanderer, Han, had a fight with another wanderer, Han Shaw, after drinking some wine, and he was stabbed to death with a knife.
Han said that before the case, he and the vagabond Han Cho lived in a flat in the eastern city, more than 20 meters apart.
Han said that on the day of the case, the two were invited to drink together by a friend, and the two had had two arguments during dinner and after dinner.
Han said he was afraid of being beaten by Shaw, so he picked up a fruit knife from the garbage dump and tied it to death.
In the court, the victim's family demanded compensation for funeral expenses, death compensation, etc. for a total of more than 500,000 yuan.
Uber's entry into Taiwan's market for four years has had a slight impact on the local traditional taxi industry.
On August 12, the Taiwan Times reported that more than a hundred taxis circled Taiwan's "Taiwan Executive Council" on the morning of the 12th to protest, causing severe traffic paralysis in the area.
The drivers can't wait any longer, said Zheng Liqia, director of the Taipei drivers' union, saying Uber has been in Taipei for four years, and the authorities are meeting at the end of this month.
The government, however, was distrustful and dragged on and on.
Law-abiding taxi drivers, who belong to the bottom-of-the-line labor force, feel deceived by the authorities when competing with illegal but unrestricted Uber.
2000 chickens at a Jiangsu farm were arrested by court and sentenced to arbitrary rendition
After the judgement came into force, Wang applied to the court for compulsory execution because Li did not comply with the obligations determined by the judgement automatically.
On October 16, 2014, the court ruled in a civil case that only 2,000 chicken eggs in one of Li's farms had been detained and could not be transferred or sold without permission.
After receiving the detention order, Mr. Li sold some of the egg chickens detained in the farm without the permission of the Guanyang Court.
As of March 8, 2015, only 142 egg chickens remained in the farm.
Journalists were informed on August 12 that the Organizing Committee of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games in Beijing announced that the Beijing Olympic Committee would inherit intellectual property rights such as the Beijing Olympic Committee's badge and logo.
No one may use the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee badge or logo for commercial purposes without the permission of the Beijing Winter Olympic Committee.
The head of the Industrial Coordination Division of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that overcapacity in steel is a global problem.
In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average level and higher than in countries and regions such as America and Europe.
China has taken decisive and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging.
The head of state pointed out that the State Council of the Central Party attached great importance to the global problem of excess steel capacity.
The departments and regions actively implement the deployment of the State Council and carry out the work seriously. This year, rough steel capacity will be reduced by about 45 million tons.
From the country's point of view, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, adopts a series of practical measures to control steel exports.
The head of the department stressed that international trade in steel products is intrinsically a market behavior, which stems from importing countries' demands and consumers' autonomous choices based on factors such as the cost-effectiveness of products.
Implementation of trade protection measures does not help fundamentally solve the problems of the development of the global steel industry; on the contrary, it will only have further impact on the international trade order.
Speaking of debt, the head stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly addressed in the process of resolving excess capacity.
Due to the large scale of steel enterprises' assets and wide-ranging involvement, some enterprises' debt relations are complicated and, if handled incorrectly, may lead to regional risks.
According to the head of the department, in recent years, as the downward pressures of the economy increased, the total demand of society gradually weakened, the utilization rate of capacity in some industries declined, and the difficulties of enterprise production and operations increased.
Some enterprises are unable to adapt to the changes in the market environment, and production and operations are difficult to follow or even near the collapse, but are constrained by some institutional mechanism factors, and there are more obstacles to exiting the market in the form of "僵尸 enterprises".
The existence of such enterprises distorts the market signal, reduces the efficiency of utilization of elements resources, increases the cost of social management, and obstructs the establishment of a fair competition market environment.
The main reason for the losses is the same as the dilemma facing the global steel industry – unstable market demand and low capacity utilization.
China mainly adopts market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law method, the government mainly do good work of workers and workers and social stability, and ensure fair and just market order.
The head of state stressed that the next step must be to remain firm and keep working on capacity, ensuring that the target of 100 million to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity is met within five years.
Chinese tourists waved their hands with surprise, and local and foreign tourists could not wait to look back.
On the same day, the members of China's first professional tourism police force, the tourism police force of the Liaoning Provincial Public Prosecutor's Office, visited Moscow Red Square to exchange lessons with the locally-trained tourism police.
The Moscow Tourist Police were divided into three teams to conduct patrols at Red Square, Nikolaisky Walk Street, and Gum Shopping Mall. The Chinese Tourist Police studied alongside the guards for more than an hour.
Policewoman柳希涅, more than 20 years old and fluent in English and Spanish, joined the tourist police force last year.
On the way he carefully observed the Russian companions one by one, and did not occasionally communicate with her.
When he encountered Spanish tourists who came to consult him, the Moscow tourist police patiently explained to each other in fluent Spanish, which impressed Wang.
"Everyone in the Moscow Tourist Police speaks foreign languages, and some even speak more than two, which is very exciting for us.
"As an international tourist island, Hainan is increasingly paying attention to attracting international tourists, and we hope to improve our ability to match the status of the international tourist island.
On the same day, the Chinese tourism police also visited the Moscow City tourism police station to exchange information with their Russian counterparts.
"I often talk to Chinese tourists and I'm very happy to see them come to Russia for tourism.
"They usually ask for help on how to get to the road, where to find a monument, how to rent it, how to get back to the hotel.
"Moscow's urban environment and tourism atmosphere have improved in recent years and attracted more and more foreign tourists," said the head of the Moscow City Tourist Police, Sergei Lessakov.
To meet the needs of tourism development, a tourism police force was established in July 2014 to patrol, protect, assist and guide tourists in major tourist attractions.
Currently, all Moscow tourist police are proficient in English, and some are also proficient in Spanish and German.
The police team divided them into nine groups according to their foreign language level, taking two lessons a week to learn self-defense slogans, laws and regulations and foreign languages.
"There are now two tourist policemen who are beginning to learn Chinese, and they are doing well, and we will continue to improve their level of Chinese," Rezakov said.
Mr. Resakov told reporters that Moscow Tourist Police has accumulated some experience since its inception and hopes to inspire colleagues in Asia.
He believes that police cooperation between Russia and China will enhance the security of citizens travelling to the other countries.
"The recruitment of the Moscow tourist police, the police model, the equipment, and the good interaction with the tourists have brought us a lot of inspiration," Chen said.
At least nine provinces, such as Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian, and Beijing, have adopted rules for the implementation of residence permits.
In the above-mentioned areas, the conditions for obtaining a residence permit are generally stated to be one of the conditions for living for more than six months, having a legally stable employment, a legally stable residence and continuously studying.
Reporters from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that the "gold content" of residence permits varies from region to region, and the scope of public services and facilities provided in some areas has been expanded compared to the provisions of the national version.
All these areas have increased the convenience for children to participate locally in Chinese college entrance examinations under the relevant conditions.
In addition, Beijing and other places have made clear demands to gradually expand the scope of public services and facilities and to publish them regularly to the public.
For example, Fujian proposes to publish to the public at least once every three years the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by holders of residence permits.
The Provisional Ordinance on Residence Permits stipulates that the public security organs shall produce and issue residence permits within 15 days from the date of receipt if they meet the conditions for the processing of residence permits.
With regard to the time limit for issuance, most regions agreed with the national version that it should be issued within 15 days.
In Hebei, it is clear that if the applicant meets the requirements and materials are complete, the police station of the place of residence shall issue the residence certificate within three working days from the date of receipt.
In accordance with the provisions of Jiangxi, if the applicant meets the conditions for obtaining a residence permit and proves that the materials are complete, the public security organ shall produce and issue a residence permit within five working days from the date of receipt.
In accordance with the Provisional Ordinance on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas will be clear to apply for a residence permit for the first time and will be exempted from the original fee for the receipt of the permit.
If Sichuan demands that local police stations or commissioned community service bodies strictly implement approved charging projects and charging standards and firmly prohibit over-scale, over-standard charging or car-boarding charges.
On July 27, 2016, the former Chairman of the Southern District Commission of Ganzhou City, Chen Yangxia, reported to the Central Committee of the People's Democratic Republic of China (CDC), where he served as the Director of the Party's Political and Political Affairs Office (Vice-Chairman-in-Office, one year probationary period).
The red wine to be drinked at night is provided by Li Yuan alone, and the other costs are borne by Liu.
The Jiangxi Provincial People's Democratic Committee reported that Chen Yangxia and Zhang Zi-liang, among others, organized and accepted meals at private meetings in violation of the central eight-point principle and violated the Party's discipline.
Bogba ate two yellow cards in the Italian Cup last season and will automatically ban one according to the rules.
Although he has returned to the Premier League, the club has continued to postpone his suspension to the Premier League.
As a result, on August 14, in a home game against Bournemouth, Bogba will be on the wall, and his return to United's debut will be delayed until the 20th match against Southampton.
As the first round 12 of the 2014 NBA draft, he will make his NBA debut next season and join the Philadelphia 76ers.
As a young European player, many fans don't know him very well, but through the Olympics, I believe the performance of Saric left a deep impression on people.
Last time Croatia lost to Spain, Saric succeeded in blocking Paul-Gassol's attempt to drag the game down to Gatineau's basket at the last minute.
Major League Baseball (MLB) coach Brad Brown recently praised Saric, saying he saw the shadow of his younger brother, Manu-Ginobilli.
It is clear that Sarici has demonstrated his talent and that 76 people are looking forward to him.
In Croatia's first two games at the Olympic Games, Saric scored 24 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists.
In the first half, Saric showed his ability to open the field and, by blocking his teammates, he was able to hit the ball outside the third line.
Although the 76ers currently have plenty of talented young players in their line-up, they do not have the outside capabilities of Saric.
From caps to long-range hits and assists, the number of insiders on the NBA field who can do this is countable.
Since the start of the Olympics, he has scored 13 points, eight rebounds, and five assists in three games, making his overall performance impressive.
Since deciding to return to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, James has signed two 1+1 contracts in a row.
With the NBA's labor agreement now approaching its final year, James will be at the forefront of the labor agreement negotiations as vice president of the NBA players' union.
Given the significant rise in league revenues, thanks to the new TV broadcasting agreements, and the disputes between bosses and players over how to handle the money, there is concern that the NBA will come to a standstill next summer.
But for James, he doesn't have to worry about becoming a free agent next summer because he's signed a three-year contract with the Cavaliers.
No matter when the 2017–18 season officially began, James was in the contract.
Since the iPhone SE's spectacular debut, the mobile phone market has also welcomed a wave of small screens.
Not long ago, Nubia also launched its first Z11 series: NubiaZ11mini.
The nubiaZ11mini continues its legacy of outstanding photographic genes and features a 5.0-inch hand-held screen, convenient and easy-to-use rear-fingerprint recognition, achieving its outstanding user experience.
Nubia's newly launched small-screen camera phone Z11mini has dropped its price from $1499 to $1299 by $200.
In appearance, the Nubia Z11mini features a 5-inch 1080P screen with a classic "small red circle" design on the front and below.
The middle frame is made of metal, the bottom is symmetrically designed and the Type-C data interface is configured.
The future of Portland smelting plant is full of uncertainty due to the cancellation of power supply contracts
As electricity companies supplying the plant revealed that the owners of one plant would terminate a supply contract, thereby nullifying all supply contracts, the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria and hundreds of workers at the plant are now facing an uncertain future.
The move came after the Victorian government decided not to continue to grant subsidies guaranteeing the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy will expire in November.
2,000 workers at the U.S. aluminum company's Portland plant may face unemployment.
Once the factory is closed, up to 2,000 people may be directly or indirectly unemployed.
And since the plant's power consumption accounts for about 10% of all electricity output in Victoria, a chain reaction may also occur.
In 2014, the U.S. aluminum company shut down the Hanry角 smelting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesey Island power plant last year.
The U.S. aluminum company's Portland smelting plant is currently losing money and facing closure risks.
The move was made after making forecasts for the next few years of the factory, initially because of the strong Australian dollar, and most recently because of the prices of the factory products.
AGL supplies electricity to the large aluminum smelter through the Old Yeong Power Plant in the Latrobe Valley. The company predicts that the owners of the other three plants will also terminate their agreement.
The factory's largest shareholder is a joint venture between U.S. aluminum and Oxide Aluminum, while China's CBC Group and Japan's Marubeni Inc. also hold small shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the smelter will continue to generate electricity demand," the joint venture said.
AGL said the contracts were supposed to be "resilient contracts" with effect from November 2016.
The contracts are terminated for 12 months, so they will be terminated in 2017.
"As a result, AGL continues to forecast that these contracts will continue to generate revenue in fiscal 2017," the power company said.
Any revenue implications for AGL since the 2018 fiscal year are currently being optimistically anticipated by futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said the company had deducted $1.87 billion from the contract value in its "expected termination of activities".
The decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect the ability of the company to operate the smelter or to guarantee the power supply of the smelter," the company said.
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract in 2010 with Elder Yang, which was due to come into effect in November, but did not explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are cautious about whether the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tamago plant near Newcastle will close due to the poor economic situation in the industry.
In comments earlier this week by analysts, AGL operations chief Stephen Michaelson said Portland's annual power consumption reached about 600 trillion watts and the Tamago plant about 900 trillion.
If the two plants were closed, the demand for electricity would be significantly reduced.
"This is not good news for us as an electricity company," he said.
Community Law Centers reject 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable groups are rejected by the Community Legal Centre every year. The funding for this service has been awkward and is now facing further cuts.
In Queensland, three out of five individuals are denied access to free legal advice and agency services, most of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those without resources to fight unfair expulsions.
Lack of funding for community legal services has already exceeded the limit and is now facing further cuts.
From June next year, the federal government will cut funding for these legal centres by another 30 per cent.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Law Center, said thousands of people are turned away each year according to the latest National Community Association Law Center survey.
Mr. Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the Federal Government did not change the existing decisions.
"The community legal centers in Queensland have been underfunded for a long time, which means thousands of people will not be able to get the essential services they need," he said.
Those who need to stay away from violence, those who have huge debts that cannot be repaid, those facing disintegrated families, those facing oppressed workers, all face problems at the legal level, and the report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by another 30% from June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable groups in Queensland will be forced to face complex legal problems without help.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland MP George Brandis to withdraw these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when faced with legal problems.
Last year, the state government pledged to raise legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now necessary to pay attention to the community legal centre and to the needs of the community, and the White House Government must also be involved in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign team prosecuted for staff pulling guns
NEW YORK – Trump’s campaign team has been charged with failing to act after its Asia chief in North California pointed a gun at a staff member while driving a Jeep in February.
Vincent Bodini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign team, described the incident at a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bodhini said he had previously hoped that the matter would be resolved internally, but after months of waiting he realized that "it would not happen".
According to Bodhini, the head of the company, Earl Phillip, "put out a handgun, put his right index finger on the board, and pointed the gun at the kneebone of Brigadier Vincent."
After complaining to local and regional campaign leadership, Bodhini learned from the tape that at least four others had experienced the same thing.
"No shooting doesn't mean no harm," Bodini said in the complaint.
Just two days before the case, the Republican presidential candidate told the public in North Carolina that if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, were elected and chosen by her favorite judge, "those who supported the Second Amendment, that is, guns, would be able to act, and gun lovers would be able to act," a statement that provoked outrage.
Trump’s campaign team has said that the media has taken his words out of context and that he does not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bodhini demanded compensation for his campaign team's lack of supervision, as well as compensation for Philip's attacks, beatings, and mental harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the news.
I can't contact Phillip.
According to a local Charlotte news agency, WCCB, Phillip had recently left the campaign team.
His consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services did not respond immediately to the call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign team has been controversial.
Both parties are represented in the ordinary court of the High Court of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Charlotte), 16-CS-14300, in the case of Bodhini and Trump's presidential campaign company.
Britain must pass on the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow airport
Heathrow will also bring vitality and prosperity to our communities, London and the country as a whole.
For me, this is the charm of Heathrow, just as at the 2012 London Olympics we did our best to ensure that our countries and regions could benefit from these events.
The Olympic Games have benefited Stratford and the Eastern Region tremendously.
And we're going to re-enrich the area by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
In our local community alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and get young people around the airport out of the unemployment trap.
As before the 2012 Olympics in London, some believed that the Heathrow expansion project was too large.
I am told that Britain will not be able to prepare for the Olympics and that we will be disgraced in front of the world.
The doubters' doubts about the 2012 Olympics are wrong, and their doubts about the Heathrow project will prove wrong.
Although there are always obstacles to overcome, Heathrow is solving every problem he faces.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority of people rather than a few.
The expansion will create up to 180,000 new jobs, generate £2110 billion in economic growth, and leave a wealth of technology and employment around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have an excellent Heathrow project team, which has completed on time and within budget an infrastructure investment of £1.1 billion, including the T5 terminal, which has been selected as the best airport terminal in the world for five consecutive years, and the T2 terminal between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are preparing to build a third runway with £16 billion in private investment.
The UK has successfully hosted the 2012 Olympic Games in London, and I believe that the Heathrow airport expansion project will also be a great success.
Now is a good time to pass on the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow airport, so that we can safeguard our future driving passports and create a technology and employment wealth that makes the UK proud.
Lord Paul Dayton is chairman of the board of directors of Heathrow Airport and former British Treasury business associate
A woman committed suicide and died on the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway at midnight.
The woman who tried to kill herself was hit by several cars on the highway early Thursday morning. Police are looking for witnesses.
The accident occurred on Thursday morning on the A1 motorway near Moritz, Va.
A woman was lying on the highway "despondently" late at night and was hit by a number of cars, state police said.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who apparently committed suicide and was hit by several cars, including a freight car.
The woman died on the spot.
Police said several drivers involved had been investigated, but some drivers were still unidentified. Police are now calling on them and witnesses to be investigated.
Lawyer Giles Hofstadter told the Geneva Forum that criminal investigations had already begun, a routine procedure in such cases.
But it is not yet known whether the driver will face charges.
Is it possible to avoid collisions?
"This will be determined by the prosecutor," Hofstadter said.
Based on the results of two other similar cases over the past five years, the driver will not be liable.
Both cases were reported to have been caused by someone taking the highway at midnight. The final ruling was that drivers couldn't expect pedestrians to cross the highway at midnight.
Last year, a policeman was charged with manslaughter for negligence, alleging that in August 2014 she hit and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paris.
The court learned that the 22-year-old victim had crossed the road after drinking.
The judge stated after the investigation that the woman's driving behaviour was perfectly legal at the time, and that the man appeared on the road "in a completely accidental and unpredictable situation", and that the woman called an emergency phone after the incident.
Anyone who can provide information about the incident near Moritz on Thursday should call 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 to contact the police.
NASA's Climate Model: It Was Suitable for Man to Live on Venus
According to NASA's predictions of the new climate model, Venus was suitable for human habitation.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Institute have developed a model that can explore the past of Venus, and the tools and algorithms used in the model are very similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model is used to determine whether Venus, which has a high surface temperature, no water, and a carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, once existed in an environment similar to that of Earth.
Previously, scientists believed that Venus's slower rotation was due to its thicker atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a thinner, Earth-like atmosphere and at the same time slower rotation.
The model also shows the early terrain of Venus.
Venus may have more dry areas than Earth, but there was sufficient water and geographical changes to foster life and prevent rapid evaporation.
In the early days, the sunlight on Venus was 30 percent darker than on Earth.
"In the model simulation of the Goddard Space Laboratory, Venus slowly rotates and its daytime on one side lasts for nearly two months," Anthony del Genio, a scientist at the Goddard Space Laboratory, explained at a press conference.
This warms the surface and produces rainwater that can form thick clouds, which, like an umbrella, blocks most of the sun's heat from the ground.
The simulation results show that the average climate temperature on Venus is actually several degrees lower than on Earth today.
The evolution of Venus simulated in this model is similar to that predicted by previous planetary scientists.
Although life may have existed on Venus, it has been exposed to excessive temperatures and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
The oceans on the planet evaporate, and water vapor is also burned by ultraviolet light.
With the evaporation of hydrogen, only a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere and deadly greenhouse gas effects remained, creating Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published the simulation results of the new Venus climate model in the Journal of Geophysical Research.
Patrick Roy resigns as head coach of the snowball team
Patrick Roy resigned as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, saying he had no say in the team's decision-making.
Joe Sachs, executive vice president of Colorado, confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new head coach.
Roy, 50, said in a statement, "In the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche with vigour, passion and determination.
I've spent the summer thinking hard about how to improve the team to a higher level of strength.
To this end, the goal of the coach and vice president must be consistent with the goal of the club.
He must also have a say in decisions affecting the team's performance.
But these conditions have not yet been met.
Sachs hired Roy on 23 May 2013, and thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," said Sachs.
We thank him for his contributions to the club and hope he will be successful in the future.
Roy was nominated for the Jack Adams Award for the League's Best Coach for his first season as manager of the Avalanche in 2013–14.
He helped the club score 112 points in the first half of the playoffs, but Colorado were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Minnesota and lost to the playoffs in the last two years.
In the 2015–16 season, the snowball team scored 39 wins, 39 draws and 4 losses, and eventually lost their second outfield qualification in the Western League by 5 points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
Workers at the North Sea Oilfield stopped the strike and continued negotiations
The chief negotiating representative said workers at the North Sea oilfield had stopped the pay strike and that the parties to the dispute had begun a new round of negotiations.
Several strikes have taken place on the North Sea oil platform operated by Royal Dutch Shell against the oil field service company Wood Group.
According to a joint statement, "Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to restart the current dispute settlement process."
We will begin early next week with a series of day-to-day meetings over the next few weeks to review these issues.
The union said its recent move to protest a possible 30 per cent pay cut was its first in 25 years.
Wood Group reduced the pay of North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent this year due to market pressures.
Prior to the wage cut, the company reduced the remuneration of sea contractors by 10% in 2014.
The company says a reduction in salaries will help it overcome the difficulties of the market downturn.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to shut down oil and gas facilities in 10 countries because it needs to streamline its operations after merging with the British energy company British Gas Group.
Energy companies are facing pressure from falling crude oil prices and the UK's June departure decision.
Member of the Scottish Parliament Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss the biggest labour dispute of the generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea is crucial to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that serves the majority, not the few," Dave said in a statement.
In 2016, new projects in the North Sea are expected to spend no more than $140 billion, compared to an average project spending of about $70 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation velocity of stars in the Enzymes
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete stellar rotation speed of the Enceladus cluster.
New data are helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster have different rotation speeds and the relationship between rotation cycles and planetary composition.
"We want to learn more about the relationship between star mass, age, and even the history of its solar system by comparing our results with other galaxies," Rosa Revel, a research scientist at the Center for Infrared Processing Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said at a news conference.
It is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are now only reaching their maturity.
They have achieved the highest speed of rotation in their lifetime.
At maximum rotation speed, these mature stars emit a large amount of stellar wind.
When these star winds pass through the star's magnetic field, they produce a braking action for the star.
As the star's age increases, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measured the rotation speeds of stars by tracking the occurrence of recognizable star nebulae (such as the Sun Nebulae).
The latest data set shows that the rotation speed of larger stars is slower than that of smaller stars.
Revel compared stars to dancers, and the larger dancers rotated at a slower speed than the smaller dancers.
"In the "ballet performances" of the Orbiter, we found that stars with slower rotation tend to have larger mass, and the fastest-moving stars tend to be the lightest stars," Rebel said.
Due to the close proximity of the Enceladus cluster, it can be used as an ideal space laboratory for comparison of star mass and rotation speed.
淚t laid the foundations for the theory model of the two-way rotation of young and old stars,?said Revel.
We still have a lot of knowledge to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation and "raise their shoes".
In three new papers, she and her colleagues elaborate on their latest analysis of the rotation speed of the Enceladus cluster, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
The depth of the bottom of the lake is more than 10 meters, and there is likely to be a danger to the water users if they do not understand the situation, said Zheng Cheng, director of the Department of Water Management, South Lake Park.
"While the South Lake rescue team is very professional, we still hope that the large number of boaters will be able to put on life jackets and do not engage in illegal activities on the lake and play safely," Cheng said.
The village has a unique marine environment, and is home to two major leisure tourist resources: natural ecology and human ecology.
"However, individual owners who purchased cars in the neighborhood feared that this would affect their car hire prices and doubted that others had any self-interest, so they went after the damage and put it on hold.
The question of when and by whom potatoes are introduced remains controversial in the academic community.
In the current mainstream view, the introduction of potatoes mainly has three lines.
The biggest and most widespread impact of the three lines introduced by the potatoes was the introduction of Chen Zhenlong from the Philippines to Fuzhou.
The Beijing Social Group Management Office will carry out a special inspection on the use of unified receipts of social group contributions from the same day.
The inspection is divided into two units: self-check and focus-examination.
According to the relevant officials of the municipality, the inspection covers social organizations that collect fees for unified receipts in municipalities from 2013 to 2015.
"The success of the Olympic Games is defined by who shares the stories on social media," the Rio Olympic Committee said in its 2012 communication strategy for the Games.
And from the reports of the current Olympic Games, the media have made a lot of changes in the way of disseminating, product morphology, language style, news angle, etc.
The International Olympic Committee and media professionals from around the world appear to be ready for this round of challenges.
On 11 August, Guangdong Securities' H shares were sold to the public for the last day. It was reported that the market reaction on the first two days of the call for shares was mild. It is scheduled to be listed at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 18 August.
An analyst at a domestic securities company said that Eastern Securities is not well-established in Hong Kong and that its management business is dominated by Eastern Securities. Compared to banks such as CBC International and CBC Securities, Eastern Securities appears inadequate.
Experts point out that many securities traders have seen a decline in performance since this year, as the stock market has returned to normal, but the situation after the company's listing depends more on the development of the company's own business than on the overall picture.
After the introduction of the new regulation, Suzhou will be the first two-way city in the country to reintroduce restrictions on purchases.
In addition to Suzhou, the two-way cities that have adopted or are about to adopt a regulation policy on buildings include Hefei, Nanjing, and so on.
Previously, Hefei had been the first to issue a restricted lending policy, whereby banks would refuse to provide housing loans to homeowners with two suites and a set of unpaid housing loans in Hefei's name.
Last week's temporary suspension of the old-fashioned sitcom Beauty's Private Kitchen, unexpectedly sparked a heated debate about the fake rate of viewing of home-made plays.
Civil rights groups issue travel warnings against Missouri
Due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks in Missouri, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored people who were preparing to travel to Missouri.
"The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, which entered into force on August 28, 2017, appealed to all African-American travelers, tourists and Missourians to pay special attention and be extremely cautious when travelling in Missouri due to the recent series of suspicious ethnic incidents in the state," the group said in a statement.
NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder to win discrimination lawsuits and that the state's enforcement targeted minorities to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are occurring in people.
They've been questioned, beaten or killed for their skin color," said Rod Chaper, chairman of the Missouri NAACP, to The Kansas City Star.
"We have received a lot of complaints that have not been received before.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the University of Missouri's racist defamation of black students and the death of a 28-year-old Tennessee black man, Tony Sands.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious circumstances. He ran out of fuel while traveling in Missouri and was detained by the Missouri Police without charge.
The advisory also noted that a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showed that "black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than whites."
"The advice is meant to raise people's awareness of what might happen to their families, friends and colleagues in Missouri," Chappell said.
"People need to be prepared to either take bail to Missouri or let their relatives know they're traveling within the state."
According to the latest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 and ranked 16th in the nation according to the crime rate.
The travel warnings are also a response to Missouri's new legislation, which will make it harder to prosecute housing or employment discrimination firms.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration law requiring local law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said it would increase the number of racial lawsuits, and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but recently advisory groups have taken this approach to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.
After experiencing the "Golden Age" when box office sales rose sharply in 2015, the entire film market entered a period of calm in 2016, and whether to break the total box office sales of $440.69 billion last year became a mystery.
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, prices for new and second-hand flats in Beijing dropped twice in October, rising by only 0.6% and 1.1% respectively.

BBC says Beijing is the most exciting city: let the outside world feel "living in a new era"
Beijing may have a 3,000-year-old history, but it is also rapidly transforming into a modern and attractive city today, according to the British media.
The Chinese capital, with an amazingly fast Internet, cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, massive investments in artificial intelligence and unparalleled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners with a spirit of exploration.
"If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere in the future," said German expatriate Clement Seich, who quoted singer Frank Sinatra as singing New York City.
"If Sinatra lives to this day, he's very likely to sing in a city like Beijing," said Sehi, creative director for Traveler's Archives magazine. "Living in this city will make you feel like you're living in a new era and always keeping up with the trends.
Simon Norton, who lives in England but has recently moved to Beijing, wrote on his personal blog 4Corners7Seas: "People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something big, something hard to say, but it keeps a lot of foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it's going to be like, and they want to see it for themselves," he said.
The city's high-quality high-speed internet and technologically friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before, it reported.
"Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society, with the Internet integrating the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions," said Andy Peña Furet, from Manila, who is now deputy editor-in-chief of the Beijing Children website.
But the smartphone is just the beginning of Beijing's technological ambitions, according to reports, as facial recognition software has become widespread, and many mobile apps use it to make bank transfers and payments, to allow people to enter apartments and offices, and even to verify the identity of online car hire drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to build an artificial intelligence technology park worth RMB 13.8 billion, which will house more than 400 companies that will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in China in the past, participating in these celebrations is appreciated by foreigners, Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and one of the most easily attended by foreigners.
"I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the new year, cleaning up their apartments and putting on a new year's greeting on their doors," said Sehi. "It's just as important that all family members gather together for a big meal on New Year's Eve, and then celebrate the New Year at midnight with a bright fireworks display. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is really an opportunity to get involved.
While the number of foreigners in Beijing is growing and growing, Chinese language barriers and the convenience of communicating with expatriates are often cited as a pretext for their not fully integrating into local culture, according to reports.
"Some foreigners have been living in China for many years, but have little experience with their host country.If your first attempts to contact Chinese people are not successful, it's easier to get along or get along with other foreigners," Sehi said.
In these so-called "old-fashioned bubbles" (the "old-fashioned bubbles" refer to foreigners mixed only among foreigners, not in contact with locals and local cultures) foreigners gather in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only foreigners are friends.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn some common language -- it's easier than people might imagine.
"One or two hours of private Chinese lessons a week or a course on entry-level radio plays should suit everyone's busy schedule," Sethi said.
Even learning a few classic short sentences can help you shop, order a meal at a restaurant or chat on a taxi.
It is reported that persistent air pollution is also a fact of everyday life, but in recent years governments have tried to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in warmer months, which are often less polluted, and viewed those blue days as an opportunity to wander around the historic hillsides or explore popular sunflower parks.
"Beijing is the city with the most things you can find under the surface," Noton said. "You'll find great art and music, delightful nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern commercial areas and ancient Hutong."
The report considers that the obstacles to the growth of human capital are increasingly apparent, particularly in the north-east region, where the annual contribution of aging to human capital growth is -1.28%.
Mr. Pan pointed out that the risks of cross-border capital flows can be controlled and the fundamental factors supporting the balance of international receipts still exist for a long time.
BEIJING, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The world shines with heritage - The 2016 International Summit Forum on the Recognition, Rehabilitation and Protection of Chinese Ancient Paintings opened at the People's University of China on December 17.
In April, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome browsers, or not to allow it to use other Google applications.
The European Commission considers the move to be detrimental to consumers and to hamper competition.
EU regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
Google faces a maximum fine of 10 per cent of its global profits, around $7.4 billion, if antitrust charges are filed.
Google has not yet commented immediately.
Google is also facing EU investigations over its preference for home-based shopping services in search results.
Zhang Yuning's reluctance is true, it can be said that he achieved from the national junior to the national Olympics "dip level" is not accidental, and the extent of his leap growth is still astonishing.
A Chart to Understand: The Legal Status of Bitcoin around the World
Abstract: In addition to the price reversal naturally triggered by the speculative attribute, the downturn in digital currencies has nothing to do with the “enemy” – the regulatory risk.
From the perspective of the visualized map, the Eastern countries are more conservative about Bitcoin than the West, and the countries that dominate the world are still looking at the legality of digital currencies, representing a large “black swan risk.”

As the regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea, and the European Union flared, Bitcoin, the world's leading digital currency, plunged sharply this week to a psychological level of $10,000 on Tuesday, the largest single-day drop in three years.
In addition to the price reversal naturally triggered by speculative attributes, this round of digital currency downturn has nothing to do with its long-held “enemy” – regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualized big-data site, has produced a chart showing Bitcoin’s legal status and level of regulation in countries around the world.
As shown in the diagram below, green represents the legitimate market for Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although the status of Bitcoin has not yet been publicly legalized, but there are no major restrictions on its use; pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. local governments attempting to use digital currencies through red line policies or regulation; dark pink represents countries where Bitcoin is defined as illegal; and gray represents countries where it has not yet been rated.
(The picture above was taken by HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15)
The paper points out that the distribution of non-green blocks in the graph shows that the traditionally eastern countries' attitude to Bitcoin is more conservative than the West.
Russia is the largest country that currently defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on Bitcoin and has not yet adopted relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, i.e., green blocks are more concentrated.
In the Middle East and Latin America, viewpoints of Bitcoin have clearly diverged, and the distribution of the blocks in these regions is more mixed.
While Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets, with some restrictions on their trade and use in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia, more Latin Americans have not spoken out about Bitcoin.
The combined figures show that of the 246 countries surveyed worldwide, 99 (or 40%) have no restrictions on the trade and use of Bitcoin, namely in green and orange-yellow areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), ten countries (or 4 per cent) define Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not deal more with digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries with a global presence (53 per cent, more than half) are still awaiting the legality of Bitcoin-based digital currencies, and represents that Bitcoin’s “black swan risk” remains high, as some of them may eventually make legislative decisions to limit digital currencies.
The paper argues that global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, which may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a declaration.
Although Bitcoin’s “humility” has been increasing exponentially since last year, it does not represent an interest for all countries, and some may fear that local law money will be threatened, or rather that digital money will be used by criminal organizations.
Wall Street speculators have written a detailed summary of international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including China's beginning to crack down on online platforms and mobile apps that focus on off-the-shelf exchanges, South Korea's still considering closing digital currency exchanges, the EU's view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted, and the risk of investors losing their "blood".
"2018: The World's Mother Opens the Digital Currency Year?", a special edition of the Wall Street Journal, states that 2018 will be the digital currency year of the world's central banks from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism, and adoption.
Russia’s criticism of Bitcoin’s legal status is also intended to give way to official digital currency issuance.
(Reuters) - Barcelona's new striker Cutinjo 8 made his first appearance in a baseball cap at No Camp, Madrid, Xinhua reported on Monday (January 8th).
Cutinio checked for Barcelona on the morning and signed a contract with Barcelona president Bartomew, which would expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Barcelona player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nou Camp.
According to Spanish media, Cutinio's transfer fee, totalling €1.6 billion (about €7.77 RMB), was the first in the history of the club and the club's history.
With Cutino still injured at the moment, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days before he can see his first performance in a baseball cap.

Now Trump’s White House is aiming at the Statue of Liberty
The most definite sign of regime change was when they began attacking the statues.
That is something that Americans and everyone agrees with, and that is why Saddam Hussein was well-planned to be ousted from Baghdad's Paradise Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key thinkers, was sure to know what would happen if he cut a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president’s proposal to strictly limit legal immigration.
Fairly speaking, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did so, a group of yacht owners and liberal followers would surely swallow him up.
But he did attack the significance of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was engraved on the pedestal in 1903 (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller rebuked Acosta, "I don't want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the goddess of liberty is the symbol of America's freedom to illuminate the world..."
The poem you referred to, which was later added, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
In fact, Miller is right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
The only country seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poverty, or your crowd of people longing for freedom to breathe, / the miserable refuse your crowded beaches."
There is no "don't suffer" moment when our screen becomes more tangible.
Miller, who has not worked in literary criticism, has made it clear that these people will not be welcome in the Trump-era United States.
This conflict over the meaning of statues is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends on the throne who engraved her poems at events held after her death, are well aware that the actions they are engaged in are highly political.
The aim of the sculpture was to express the connection between French and American communism through an ancient classical metaphor of a woman transformed into a goddess of liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poetry, the image of a woman is no longer abstract, but she speaks.
She gave herself a very different name: the exiled mother.
The combination of the poem and the painting was a successful feminist revolution and a devastating blow to American patriotism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, who was an interim baptizer for Trump, in 2010 argued that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was now an early neo-conservative who brought America’s spark of wisdom to the foolish world: “The goddess of liberty is unprecedented.”
She intended to take the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the light of America's road.
What's unusual is that Limbo is actually being touched by something.
The meaning of a statue depends entirely on the perspective of cognition.
The most imaginative thing about Lazarus is to be able to see it, and the tired, poor, but hopeful man can see it on the deck after a long, often terrible journey.
On the surface, this is a question of how people who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives view the world.
Her statue conveys to them the hope and the spirit of welcome they need to hear.
Of course, this is not the view that Miller and Trump wanted to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the road, but to ignite their only source of power of hatred.

2017 World Championships: Neil Black highly praises the Scottish players on the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle recalls that the British national team had only two Scottish players.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said the 16-strong Scottish team in the World Championships team would make a "great contribution to the national team".
The number of Scottish athletes selected to participate in the 2017 London Athletics World Championships, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Blake believes that "Scotland is developing at an extraordinary rate" and that British athletes must learn from it.
"We accept this and try to understand it, and we will stick to it until we succeed," Blake said.
"I talked to the staff at the Scottish Academy of Physical Education, who thought it was related to their role.
Scottish athletes believe this is related to their role.
The British Athletics Association believes this is related to their role.
Even people on the street think so.
Whatever the case, it's brilliant."
Several Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete 5,000 metres with Mo Farah, and Eilidh Doyle as team captain.
"Ared was a little modest.
Her captain's speech is unbelievable," said Blake.
"Many athletic athletes, whether they are Scottish or wherever they live or train, walk out with pride and determination.
The passion and genuine emotion that Ed naturally puts into it is very good.
The British Federation silver medallist, who will compete in his fifth World Championship in the 400 metres hurdles, said it was "unbelievable" that 16 Scottish players were on the British national team.
Previously, the number of Scottish athletes participating in the World Championships was as high as seven, which was the number achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is at the forefront. She has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1500 m and 5000 m events.
Chris O'Hare, who competed in the 1500m event, was another notable Scottish athlete who had previously achieved good results in the season, winning both the British national pre-election and the Olympic anniversary games.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championships, when the only other Scottish player on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said she was very proud of the fact that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but also, in some cases, challenged medals to compete in the finals.
"What's special about being a national team captain is that it's voted by other national team members, so knowing that your teammates voted for you to achieve extraordinary achievements, in any case, is a great honor for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scottish players.
It just shows how far we've gone.
And they're all old track and field athletes here who are heading towards the goal of winning the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Well, I think it's very good.
I have just referred to the fact that, in this case, we are very lucky because we are hosting the World Championships at home.
That's why it's really important for us to be able to thrive with hometown support and returning to the Olympic stadium.
I will get a second chance to participate in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be fantastic.

Screen critics on Facebook: Don't run for office if you can't stand the criticism of voters
Our father-in-law knows how bad the media is.
Everyone in America loved Washington, but soon afterwards, the major newspapers began to attack him in all his ways, from domestic politics to political principles.
He was undoubtedly annoyed by these criticisms.
But he didn't silence those critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech is deprived--we will be slaughtered in silence and foolishness like lambs."
This reminds me of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to study in Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 posts because they published their views on his Facebook official home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against him earlier this week.
The governor's officials believed the lawsuit was very crude, and online reports filled their strong resistance: "Who cares?
Many people say, "It's just a face book.
But it's important.
This is especially important because it's people like Hogan who are facing it.
He is a Republican who serves as governor in a democratically-dominated state, and he is also surprisingly popular.
Among the nation's 50 governors, he ranked second for his praise.
Hogan wasn't a reactionary hawk.
He steadfastly ruled Maryland and strictly adhered to the rules.
He was also good at making face books the main way of communicating with voters, and jokingly showed his baldness after chemotherapy for the first time on his homepage.
So it is completely unnecessary, and ultimately dangerous, to block people from commenting on the Governor's homepage, a public forum that is the official management platform for publicly tax-supported officials.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Shass, defended the governor's actions, saying she thought hiding their comments was just to keep them in check.
But they overly succinctly describe it as a web of flooding beasts or cynicism.
The Washington Post has spoken face-to-face with people covered by Hogan.
They are merely ordinary people in dialogue with their chosen leaders: they are teachers, small business owners and pastors, not some kind of flood beast.
They all said their comments were deep, respectful, and not downstream.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan to keep his Catholic faith in mind.
Maryland's big lawyer, Lakshmi Sharma Ramani, was not jealous, but she asked about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post's news story commentary, "I am polite to comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes and other recent news events.
Likewise, I don't like a group of people commenting on the same subject, because these people are directly ignored by some people who think they are so-called peer-to-peer psychologists, rather than seeing them as citizens of troubled countries and troubled people.
The Governor's term of "intensive junk bombing" might seem to others to be "advocating".
The era of Facebook made it easy to modify an information by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And it's cleaner than it used to be, and to do the same in the last few decades it's necessary to send staff out to gather and burn newspapers with criticism or arrest or silence protesters.
But that's really what's happening now, but it's on a digital level.
Hogan was not the first public official to be accused of shouting at others on Facebook and other social media.
Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
There was a landmark verdict last week in Virginia on this kind of issue.
According to District Judge James C. Cacharis of the U.S. city of Alexandria, the actions of the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Rhode Island to screen voters from her page on the homepage violated the First Amendment.
Kentucky Governor Matt Beveen (R.) has also been recognized by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage had a similar influence to the Internet.
The number of newspapers doubled from 1776 to 1800, and people wrote anonymous letters critical of his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington also targeted his anonymous flood monster.
Using pseudonyms such as Eurika, Valerius, Belisarius, and Bogus, journalists were harshly criticized for Washington's decision.
His office was flooded with petitions criticizing his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation between His Majesty the King of England and the United States of America, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper's online project.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
A slight wind blowing through the city stirred people's sensitive nerves.
Limited purchase is a hard bar of many urban real estate regulation policy.
In May 2017, Jinan issued a regulation that undergraduate students pay social security for six months in a row, and can enjoy the same home purchase policy for local residents with permanent households.
In June, Wuhan adopted a policy requiring university students to complete their studies within three years on graduation certificates and employment certificates.
The policy was then tightened up, with officials saying that "students can buy houses at prices below 20% of the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued a regulation that young people with undergraduate and higher education qualifications from foreign universities could apply to settle in Chengdu with a certificate of graduation.
In addition, other cities or regions such as Kunshan, Shanghai and Hong Kong have also adopted policies related to the "introduction of talent" to lower the threshold for talent buyers and sellers.
Zhang Hongwei believes that this is actually the competition of the major cities for the population especially the talents, to keep the population especially the talents, that is the most important significance of these real estate policies.
It was even suggested that this meant that the time had come for the "limited purchase" of buildings to be lifted.
The director said that the filming had been planned for a long time, and that the first revision of the script was in 1999, and that he was even preparing to seek Kim Jong-un to play Yan Thirteen.
Ronan Lovety expects to feel at the Renaissance Club home
Former European champion Ronan Lovetti will enjoy his return home for the next three days at the 25th edition of the Scottish Commonwealth Open, hosted by the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who led the next-door Acherfield Lynx to the finals last year but ultimately lost to Paul Isle, now works for the new stadium, representing the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Salvati as the event ambassador.
"I witnessed the founding of the Renaissance Club, and we will also witness its glory through this match," said Raffi.
The athletes will see the best of the stadium and the best of the state.
Jerry founded this place unparalleled.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the competition and is very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best stage to showcase the stadium.
Irish is looking forward to his first coronation, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's really very special," said the Shausport athlete.
I didn't defend the Extreme Madrid Open because it was cancelled in my second year of winning.
It feels wonderful to come to this place,
It's very nice to play golf here.
Last year's memories come to mind, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's victory has a special meaning for us.
It was really a special memory that we will always remember.
Gary Orr, who turned 50 earlier this year, returned to his home country to play in the European Tournament.
This was his first appearance at the Scottish Open since 2013.
"It's always more meaningful to go back to your hometown," said Allen Or
You want to do well; but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoy being able to play again. I've been playing golf all the time.
I am very satisfied with the current situation.
The three teams included former Masters winner Ian Wooden and regular-season champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNally.
There were six Scottish players on the field, two of whom were Or and former League captain Sam Thorens, and four were Andrew Odcorn, Stephen McCalister, Bill Roumuth and Ross Delamond.

The new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, which was introduced earlier this year, significantly reduces China's environmental law enforcement efforts, the Secretary for Environment and Environment Protection, Mr Zhu Zhou, introduced in Beijing on 22 August.
At present, environmental authorities in various parts of China can use punitive measures such as daily continuous punishment, sealing and detention, limiting production and suspending production, and transferring administrative detention to investigate environmental offences, and cooperate with judicial authorities to punish environmental offences.
In August, Zhu introduced a total of 335 cases of confiscation and detention, 177 cases of limitation and suspension of production, 189 cases of administrative detention and 166 cases of alleged environmental pollution offences.
Among them, Henan has implemented seven consecutive daily penalties. Currently, China is embarking on a comprehensive effort to improve environmental pollution management from end-to-end control to full-scale embedding.
Although economic downturn pressures have appeared, China's Ministry of Environment has previously made clear that China should correctly address environmental protection's position in economic development and strengthen its "green determination". The lower the economic growth rate, the less environmental protection can be relaxed and the better environmental protection plays the optimum role for the economy.
Not the highest, only higher, Guizhou茅台 shares in the high road of innovation is not stopping at all.

Russian media say Putin will own a new domestic car: 15 per cent cheaper than Mercedes
Russia's Minister of Labor and Trade Manturov said the price of a car for President Vladimir Putin's "team" was between RUB 600 million and RUB 700 million, according to Russian media.

From the end of February to the beginning of March, the president's main research and development unit, the National Institute of Automotive Engineering (NAMI), will deliver 16 cars to the Federal Police Service, according to Reuters on January 16.
The team project, which is expected to produce three cars for the country's leading figures using a unified modular platform, is reportedly budgeted at RUB 124 billion, consisting of long-distance cars, three-cars and small passenger cars.
The news came about five years ago that the president was to build the first domestically-built extended car since the Soviet Union. According to the R&D unit's plan, the new car will be equipped with an 800 hp engine and armor and weighs 6 tons.
It is reported that the engineering and technology team of the German Porsche company has been involved in the development of power equipment.
Mantovarov told reporters that the team's cars will be available for retail from 2019 onwards, with all configurations available for purchase.
"From next year onwards, all interested parties will be able to order, be it bulletproof or luxury, with no restrictions on sales," the minister said.
The Russian Ministry of Trade and Industry plans to increase the annual production of the "Team" series of cars to more than 1,000 by 2020.
"We're loaded with 18 now, with more than 70 this year, 200 next year, and even more next year," he said.

It has already had a great effect, and actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people to stay away from disease, but also drive economic development to reduce the development gap in regions.
The toilet problem is an outline problem, a node in the development of social problems.

Poverty and Death in Indonesian Kinshasa
Baddyna dagger doesn't need a stove to cook.
She rarely even uses a pot.
Her wooden house is located in the capital of Panai County, Papua, Indonesia. The housewife usually puts a potato, locals call it "nota," directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt potatoes were hastily taken out by a pair of unwashed hands and swallowed.
Dejee sat on the mud - she had no furniture, and this was also the place where she did her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, and the water for washing clothes was very muddy, coming from nearby swamps.
A room without a roof has a toilet, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not separated from the field to take care of her.
The phenomenon of polygamy is very common here.
Of course, it's dangerous to work until late: most of the men in the village don't work, and many are drunk, plus there are many soldiers.
Nobody dare walk in the village after 5 p.m., she said.
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papuan Highlands, once a Dutch colony that joined Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but that referendum was also controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by hand in front of the occupation forces.
The current campaign of strong demands for independence and opposition to Dutch rule will soon be directed at the Government of Jakarta, which exercises high-pressure rule over the region and isolates foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
It is a remote, smoky place; to get here you have to take a 90-minute flight from the province of Chaapadra to Nabyre and then rent a car for five hours, all the way over the river and over the sea.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 people, wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and folded iron roofs were all kinds of yellow-brown coverings made of iron rust.
Few Indonesians come here, not to mention journalists, and hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago Babians believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes as well.
"We don't like to wear these clothes," said Deja, referring to her bright hand-woven scarves, dark shirts and bright half dresses.
We used to cover our bodies with leaves.
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line, and the region with the highest infant mortality and lowest literacy rates in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's Kinshasa.
Piney County is located on a highland area roughly the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. The world's largest and most profitable Cotonou gold mine, Glassberg, is only 60 miles away, owned by Philadelphia McMurland Copper Company, headquartered in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Philadelphia mining gold and copper mines worth about $31 billion.
Furthermore, the timber resources of Papua are very rich, with an estimated value of $7.8 billion.
These rich resources, however, are also the source of the tragedy of the Babian people, whom Indonesia's powerful military forces have been able to suppress.
A 2005 survey by the New York Times showed that Phillips paid nearly $2 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, up to $150,000 per official.
The Babylonians' increasingly strong demands for independence threatened the gold lord and he suffered cruel treatment.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, more than 500,000 Babians have been killed and thousands raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass massacres in the tribal highlands of Papua in the 1970s have escalated into genocide.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year alone.
A 2016 report by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane, “We’ll Lose It All,” contains proof of outrageous acts of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – another report says rape and electrocution are particularly prevalent – and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Indonesian researcher Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch said "violence occurs every day and it is difficult to calculate the number of victims."
The resources of Papua attracted large numbers of immigrants from outside Indonesia, and pressure began.
83% of the province's 350,000 inhabitants are Christians, but the demographic structure has changed since Muslim economic migrants arrived from the densely populated Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi islands.
Javanese snack stalls sell more and more chicken and vegetables mixed with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
"The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional markets at lower prices than the local Babians," explains 24-year-old Panía local Abés Yu, who moved to the province of Chaapura to seek work.
This has left the local Babian women, Mama-mama, out of their markets.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo (also known as Joko Widodo) pledged in his 2014 campaign to address the inequalities and abuses of power in Papua.
The former carpenter's road to the Presidential Palace of Jakarta has been supported by 27 of the 29 districts, including Panie.
But nothing has changed in Bavaria. Today, the locals feel betrayed.
"We have broken our hearts," he said, "and in 2014 we voted for Zakov in the hope that he would fulfil our wishes and restore justice."
Indeed, just two months after Zakov took office in October, Panie had the worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, in front of a bonfire outside of Enalotali, 11 children sang Christmas carols, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly jumped onto a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
One of the soldiers, according to the local pastor, A. T. Bye, was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the drunken soldiers were chasing the children with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
The 16-year-old Julianus Yemin was severely beaten and paralyzed.
Hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency election commission building, escalating the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in front of a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They carried the ceremonial hunting bow and danced the waita dance of the Babian Mee Pago tribe – running around and imitating birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the military regular post.
According to an official document seen in Time magazine, when the mood continued to escalate, soldiers received an order via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately," but the document was not released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayaki, 56, the mayor of Kego Koto Street, Enarrotali, felt the danger was imminent, so he called the crowds to calm down and begged them to go home.
But no one was inclined to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his colorful wooden house and told Time magazine, "When I turned around, my left arm suddenly shot.
Kayaki still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he says the bullets came from among the gathered soldiers.
He said, "It was crowded and they fired a lot of guns.
According to the local Orthodox Orthodox brothers, he witnessed the shooting and saw three guns in the body of Orthodox.
"I ran over to check on his body to see if it was him, " Yuhanes told Time with sadness
I found him dead ... I kissed him.
Inspector General Eugene Mende told reporters that his subordinates were only "protecting" the police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, a spokesman for the Papuan police, police chief Pgio Sulistio, said, "When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
This is a matter of life and death.
Five young protesters were killed and more were injured, according to Human Rights Watch.
The next day, the news of the killing spread only slowly in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Sakov gave a loud and heartfelt speech in Chaapura, expressing his deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power that has left its mark on the history of Papua.
"I hope this case can be resolved as soon as possible, so that it will not happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Secretary of State for Security, Sergio Vieira de Mello, stated that he wanted to establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuses for withdrawal were almost unheard of.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago," he said.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000.
The point is that we are already committed to solving these violations, but this will require a process.
Then, on 5 June, in Jakarta, Verando left for Antwerp in a conversation with Time magazine, saying that he had no plans to set up an appeal mechanism in Papua.
On the contrary, he said, "Everything will be settled according to law."
The United Nations has filed a "anti-human rights" complaint against Villando over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but says 11 cases of human rights violations in the Babbage region have been resolved, including the case of Panie.
The families of the victims of the Panie incident sniffed at these remarks.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not moved at all," said Yuhanes.
Years later he said, "I'm tired.
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army. I'm afraid of being shot.
His brother, Yucabus, also believed that the people of Pania were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
"The military came to me after I buried the body," he said.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Deay County, near Panie.
A manager of a construction company refused to help transport a paralyzed man to the hospital, and the two sides clashed, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Ravianus Dowood, drowned while fishing along the nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired a warning.
However, anti-riot mobile units (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowds, killing one person.
"We were all in panic and now we're scared they're going to come back," 29-year-old Dominic Bady told Time magazine, living near the hospital when he saw the wounded rushed to the hospital.
"I hid for two days at home.
The Diet has called for the prosecution of the police involved and for the withdrawal of anti-riot forces from the area.
Panee has always been an undesirable place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fuelled the discontent of the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of the pine forest.
Many people joined the Movement for a Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claimed to protect the rights of the Papuan people by decentralizing attacks and raids to kidnap Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Liberation Movement were born in Pania, including Tadeus Yugi and Daniel Yudas Kogaya.
Consequently, in recent years, thousands of Paniais have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of “preserving national sovereignty”.
Some people have never appeared.
In the eyes of the Babians, Panie is a "forgotten tragedy".
Poverty breeds discontent.
There was so little rice on the market that the locals could not afford it.
Bread is nowhere near enough.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruits and leaves vegetables.
Farming is a woman's job, and every woman can look after four or five potatoes.
They usually collect most of it for writers and sell the rest on the local market.
Ten chips are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have opened up among the local Papuans and new immigrants, and the number of such immigrants has increased considerably since the opening of the new route to Nairobi Airport.
The few jobs available usually fall into the hands of better educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the funds or the necessary skills to run a competitive company.
"Young people don't want to stay in this village ... because there's no job and no money," said John Goby, chairman of the Panee Tribal Council.
Babylon is isolated from the world.
Moreover, restrictions on international media are still tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Marcel Longchamp were expelled from Bavaria because they “did not cooperate with the relevant agencies” even though they had rarely obtained a filming license.
According to Human Rights Watch's Asia Deputy Director-General, Phil Kean, Sarkozy's election pledge to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, "If foreign journalists try to cover the disaffected provinces of Papua and West Papua in the eastern part of Indonesia, they run a new risk: rejection of visas and blacklisting."
The lack of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to its neighbors.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “all kinds of general human rights violations” in Papua, including the gunfighting in Pania.
Several of these countries have also supported the Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Amanata Naser ignored the group's allegations and told reporters in Jakarta, "The evidence of human rights violations is hard to hide because Indonesia still has a democratic system and media freedom.
Locals want more attention from foreign governments.
On 4 May, when Dutch Ambassador to Human Rights Kes van Bal led a delegation of officials to Chaapra, the local people broke down in silence and cried out, "We want freedom," according to a person familiar with the meeting, who also attended but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Babians say they are unlikely to run for president again.
"Sokovy's intentions were good," said Goughby, chairman of the tribal council, "but he was surrounded by people who had been involved in the Panie shootings.
He wanted to let Sokov know that the people of Pania not only lived under the threat of a greedy army, but lacked everything, the region lacked education and public health care.
Goby said the people of Pania, like other Babians, believed that they voted for Sokovi as his debt to be repaid.
"They don't need money, they need justice," he said.
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Piney shootings have made their last symbolic resistance: to bury a victim's body opposite that military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won't let the culprits forget their crimes.
"My family was killed," Yucabus said, lowering his head.
What else can we do?
On February 10, 2017, China's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved an application for the launch of Guangdong's Cheap Household Courier Co., Ltd., and issued the Guangdong Stock Exchange (SEC) listing permit for China's Cheap Household Courier Co., Ltd., after more than 20 days of the IPO.

Fire again swallows Dubai's torch tower
On Friday, a fire broke out in Dubai, the world's tallest residential building, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 79-story, 337-metre-high supertall building.
This was the second time in just two years that high-rise buildings were swept under fire, and it happened in the skyscraper known as the Torch.
The building has been evacuated and no injuries have been reported, and the cause of the fire has not yet been found.
"We were sleeping, and then we were woken up by the firefighters, and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Firefighters fired at around 4 p.m. local time (0000 Greenwich Standard Time) and are heating up the building, according to the Dubai Civil Protection Authority.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide shelter for affected persons.
The accident may again raise concerns around the world about the safety of external wall materials used in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the Torch Tower Administration after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were decorative and insulating covering outside walls.
British police have indicated that they believe the problems with heat insulation and panel covering in the London Greenfield building may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also hinted that Massa was likely to return, although he had already announced his retirement.
A month before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang, South Korea, on January 9, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea has become increasingly intense as the Olympic fireworks from the south to the north pass through and preparations are under way.
South Korean public opinion expects the long-delayed talks to bring a "golden egg" to the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang.
On November 1 last year, the holy flame of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics arrived in South Korea.
The heat wave caused by the fire was directly reflected in the sales of tickets to the Winter Olympics in Pingchang.
Just over two months ago, the ticket sales for the Winter Olympics in Beijing were only 32 per cent, and the ticket sales for the Winter Paralympics were only 4.3 per cent.
But as Pyongyang Winter Olympic Committee Chairman Li Xifan predicted to reporters recently, "As the Olympic fireworks are spreading throughout South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising, and I am confident that ticket sales will soon improve."
According to South Korean media, as of January 3, sales of tickets to the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang had reached 64%, and sales of tickets to the Winter Paralympics had exceeded 50%.
To encourage foreigners to visit Korea, the South Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on August 8 that foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang will be extended their stay in Korea for a maximum of 120 days.
The survey found that more than one-fifth of American travelers boarded with illegal goods
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had intentionally or unintentionally carried illegal goods on board through the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority checkpoints, with at least 6 per cent of passengers unintentionally carrying unlawful knives or other blades on board.
Less than 1% of passengers claimed to have been mistakenly travelling with guns, ammunition or explosives after the incident.
The survey, conducted by airline charter company Stratos Jet Charters Inc. for more than 1,000 people, also found that young travelers are more likely to ignore the regulations publicly.
Of those who admitted to attempting deliberately to board TSA contraband, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation population.
The most common items deliberately smuggled by TSA inspectors are food and beverages.
More than 3 per cent admitted to carrying knives for safety checks, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to carrying illicit drugs on board.
The company said the survey was conducted to understand the number of people who accidentally and deliberately carried prohibited goods on board aircraft.
It's no surprise that the people who are the most likely to carry the prohibited goods through security checks - intentionally or unintentionally - are the people who fly the most frequently.
However, the company pointed out that the TSA Guide was a bit complicated and incomprehensible.
People are usually unsure what kind and how many liquids can be carried.
So it's not surprising that the TSA's highest revenues come from illicit liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might also ban books.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not.
Secretary of the Environment Paul Pratt changes his mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
One day after fifteen states were prosecuted, Secretary of the Environment Scott Prut reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era measures to reduce air pollution from smoke.
Prut proposed this change because, compared to previous governments, the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more rapidly to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not mention the legal challenge brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former post.
The focus of the controversy was on setting October 1 as the deadline for states to begin implementing the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Prut announced that he would postpone his appointment for one year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan, to avoid "interfering with local decision-making or hampering economic growth".
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Prut was the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, a longtime opponent of stringent environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Prut has repeatedly blocked or delayed regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the latest legal obstacles to Putt's regulatory return agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the Secretary of Environment overrides his powers in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's demands on oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Prut suggested a major turnaround in his attitude to the ozone standards, saying he was committed to strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency's commitment to work with states to achieve new standards through complex procedures.
"In previous government administrations, the Environmental Protection Agency usually missed a designated deadline and then waited for the prosecution of radical groups and others and agreed to a timetable by agreement," said Pratt, who has filed dozens of lawsuits against the Agency in his previous work.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.
Nevertheless, the EPO's statement stated that Prut may once again use his "deferred authorization and all other legally available authorizations" to ensure that the provisions comply with "good policy and best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for sweeping changes to the ozone layer regulations.
The House bill approved last month aims to postpone the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who heads the coalition of states this week, has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's reversal - after we filed the lawsuit - is a significant victory for the health and safety of 670,000 New Yorkers, whose communities are directly affected by smoke emissions from more than 1.5 billion Americans," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, D.C., as well as the District of Columbia, joined New York City in participating in the case.
Ground ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke causes severe respiratory problems in sensitive populations and causes thousands of premature deaths each year.
Advocates of public health and environmentalists, of course, are applauding the surprising change in Prut.
"It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under huge pressure from those in charge of protecting the air we need to breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Centre for Biodiversity.
"We must fight with the Trump administration to the end to meet the polluters and special interest groups' ideological movements.

Since the second half of 2009, the sales volume of shrubs in Xiaoshan has remained high. Especially this spring, the sales of shrubs in Xiaoshan reached a new record high, with sales increasing and prices rising. According to statistics, the sales revenue of shrubs in Xiaoshan area increased 48 per cent from the same period last year in January-June this year, which is the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
Xiaoshan District Forestry Bureau Deputy Director Mr Shi Hai Yuan said that with the good sales situation, the production of Xiaoshan flower trees has also developed more rapidly.
Over the past two years, the area of 30,000 acres has been expanded to 180,000 acres, while the area of 80,000 acres has been actively developed outside the area.
At the same time as the area of cultivation is expanded, the quality of seedlings is constantly improving, the value of seedling nursery is constantly increasing, the seedlings of high-quality and large-scale seedlings are preserved more and more, and some seedlings are being sold out.
He also reminded that in the face of the current boom in production and sales, producers should calmly face and analyze objectively, both to see the long-term and continuous increase in the demand of society for flower trees, and also to realize that the market competition will be more intense.
On the morning of July 13 in Beijing, the United States company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the District Court of East Texas, accusing Apple of violating its 2010 application for a battery technology patent.
The company has previously filed suits against Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba using the same patent.
The lawsuit alleged that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices infringed U.S. patent 7,657,386, named Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wishes to receive cash compensation, or to charge a patent fee for the infringing equipment against which the judgment has been declared.
Judging from the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that the iPhone's fast-charge function infringed the company's patent.
A fast-charged iPhone can quickly charge up to 80% of the power and then recharge it with a trickle.
Somaltus is in fact a so-called "patent troll" because it does not provide obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information on the Internet.
However, they have succeeded in reaching an out-of-court settlement on the patent with car manufacturers such as Ford and Nissan.
The meeting considered that accelerating the development of information technology, promoting the interconnected integration of resources, efficient utilization, and raising the level of industrial digitalization and intelligence are of great significance for promoting "China Makes 2025" and mass entrepreneurship, mass innovation, fostering new mobility, and improving the quality of people's lives.

Trump has pressed Mexico to pay for border walls, according to leaked phone records
The Washington Post disclosed the telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, in a telephone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the construction of the border wall.
The president reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with his public attacks on the walls, and it was said that Pte. Long had said to him, "Don't tell the media.
In his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
His telephone records with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, showing a tense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that it was “ridiculous, disgusting, and stupid” for the United States to accept a deal to send refugees to Australia, and that he had suggested that the United States prohibit the resettlement of refugees, while now insisting on a deal with the Obama administration’s good offices would make him look like a fool.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call today.”

Morban Tragedy: Activists Re-establish Racist Private Punishment, Strengthen Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of spectators in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, towards a small bridge on the Mall Beach.
There were four black passengers and a white driver on board, and before the car reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns came forward and blocked the way the car was going.
The gang's head, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a deep sip of cigars and glanced into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were filled with fear.
"We want - Roger," shouted the man.
Pull him out of the car!
A young black man was dragged down from the front-row passenger seat, screaming in silence.
Fortunately, the terrible scene of 22 July was only a replay.
But when Roger puts his belt around his neck, almost all the audience around him breathes.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been returning to the bridge, recreating the scenes of two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, and George and Mere Dorsey – who were hanged that night in private by the Three Ks in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"While we know who they are, and we've seen them in the community, it's incredible that they haven't been arrested in years," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the rerun.
This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls.
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgian senator and lifetime activist.
For him, the rehearsal was a remarkable appeal, reminding the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want to prosecute, we want to end the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first," he said.
"Unless we get justice, we won't get healing and reconciliation.
On 27 July 1946, a coroner covered a bed sheet on the body of a victim of the Morban massacre.
More than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of involvement in private criminal activities, according to FBI files obtained from NBC News.
But none of them have been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the twin motives behind private punishment are well-known throughout the city: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed Georgian black citizens to vote for the first time in the primary later that summer.
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at about the same time, black landlord Roger Malcolm assassinated white landlord Bennett Hester in a fight – seemingly for a woman’s sake.
According to Brooks, there are rumors in the town that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that on July 25, 1946, prominent white landlord Roy Harrison spent $600 to bail Malcolm out.
Dorothy and his cousins Mary and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
But when they came back from the prison and were about to cross the Morban Bridge, a group of private criminals surrounded their cars.
"The facts prove that Harrison organized and ordered the murder," an FBI report concluded.
"It is clear that there is a conspiracy between the state and local law enforcement agencies, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witnesses.
Brooks is very brief.
"This is a disaster of voting rights," he said.
"They were brutally murdered, and the killer sent a message to the blacks in the community: 'If you register and vote, you'll have the same end.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual rerun of the Morban Bridge Private Prison Massacre.
She has a distinctive, captivating, and profoundly racist background, and many people hope that such racism will no longer exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
"We don't want to talk about torture, because torture makes us face the ugly face of everyone," she said.
But if you don't listen to me, or if you don't listen to me talk about my experiences, I can't build a relationship with you.
This year's show began in June, with nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room on the first day to listen to Green's extensive performance review.
Wayne Marbo was the co-director of Green's film.
For years, he has been playing the role of the Three K Party, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Malbo said.
But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to that time.
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Lascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Bennett Hester, were rehearsing their speeches.
At the beginning of the play, Malcolm screams and pushes out Hearst, angry at his wife Dorothy, who is sleeping with him.
I said, roll out my plate!
Rascona returns to the field.
Then they started fighting.
Then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's the matter? " asked Rascona.
He was panicked and confused.
Have I played too much?
"No," said Green, laughing.
"I just don't think white people will say 'oh' when they come back.
"Yes," said another black actor.
"You must have a strong tongue.
In this way, the energy in the room changed; the feeling of friendship removed the discomfort.
Everybody tried to do this, not only to perform the play, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "Ah," the tone was sharp and powerful.
There was no one to laugh at.
The replay ended strongly and quickly.
There was a scream, a gunshot, and then a silence.
A woman in a funeral dress stood by the actor's body, singing Billy Halliday's mourning words "Wonderful fruit".
Her voice overwhelmed the other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were wiping sweat and tears.
Nearly half of the audience were blacks and whites.
A couple came to see the show from Issaca, New York, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to Markham and Dorothy's cemetery for the feast, a journey of nearly eight hours, and they were all enduring the uncomfortable wetness of Georgia.
Until then, the murderer was still an enemy, but now, standing on the same land where the execution took place, the air was filled with anxiety.
When the last note of the song disappears, Green asks people to approach some of the bodies that the actors play.
The children lowered their heads, looked at false blood and bodies, stealing from each other.
"They weren't really dead," a little boy murmured, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and the performance ended.
The actor threw away the chain and wiped off the tears.
Bradshaw embraced Malbo, a man dressed up as a three-K party leader.
Nick Lascona embraced his two colleagues and wept silently in their arms; the emotions of the performance eventually infected him.
"It doesn't matter," said one of the women.
"We know that's not what's inside you.
There is a reason for you to do this.
Afterwards, the audience sat down for dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta had a very intimate chat with a black couple they had just met, talking about rehearsals.
Dennis Duplinsky finds it hard to find words to describe what she feels after watching.
"It's hard to imagine those terrible words and acts ... being said and done by people like you because they look like you," she said.
For me, it really makes me think that solitary confinement is still going on," she added, "and now it's only called police shootings.
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat by the table and watched, tasted and tasted civil rights.
He says he's already planning for next year's performance.
"Repetition is an encouraging way, because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it's also very educational," he said.
"It could happen again if you don't learn from it.
Those who do not study and understand their own history are doomed to do the same.
For gas marketization reform, the importance of "network independence" reform is obvious, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
At 11:25 a.m. on 7 July, an explosion occurred in the dairy factory of Kai Luan Group Chemical Co., Ltd., located in the old metallurgical district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, where 13 workers were trapped.
So far, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to hospital for rescue, while the remaining 12 are in intensive search.
It is understood that the scene has now been blocked and local public security, fire department, medical and other departments are rescuing the scene.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a huge noise at the time of the incident, and a mushroom cloud burst out in a moment.

Media: Scientists at China Air Force Engineering University study laser satellites for space garbage disposal
China's scientists have come up with a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up Earth's cluttered orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky junk, according to the Associated Press.
Researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University have written a paper titled "Development of a model for space debris mitigation with a base laser," which describes how space debris can be irradiated to smaller, less harmful debris by using a base platform laser, according to Newsweek on January 15.
For years, space waste has been an issue of concern to international space agencies, and NASA has considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris, according to reports.
The way to clear large-scale space debris includes large-scale networks used to clean up and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted laser simulations and concluded that this would be an effective way of clearing Earth's orbit.
The paper summarizes: "(imitation research) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of laser space debris removal technology on the base platform.
A 2014 study by the US defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats per day for satellites orbiting.
High-speed debris moving along Earth's orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions, described by experts at the European Space Agency as "a deadly series of threats".
Space is essentially empty, but space closer to Earth is becoming more and more crowded. Every satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris running around the Earth, and as time goes on, these debris will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the higher the probability that a satellite still operating normally will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
It is reported that all space agencies have developed plans to clean up space garbage in the future.
NASA is considering using jet gas to reduce the speed of the debris and get it out of orbit, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan's idea is to capture the debris with an electric chain.
At the moment, China is also proposing a solution to the problem of space junk, which consists of smashing floating space junk into less harmful pieces with a large laser.
According to a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force University of Engineering, published in the German monthly optics magazine, installing such a laser on a satellite would clean up space efficiently enough, at least according to the simulation results.
It is reported that the only way to confirm its effectiveness is through testing, which is not currently scheduled, but that it may be possible to install a laser on a satellite and then send it into space.
Once this is done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space waste in a timely manner.

Beijing Group cut 3,000 jobs and drastically reduces dividends to revitalize business
British education group PepsiCo said on Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its mid-term dividend by 72 per cent as it embarks on another restructuring project to deal with business pressures.
Chief executive John Farren said most of the job cuts would take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, with 4,000 jobs cut in previous restructurings.
In May, PepsiCo announced plans to cut a further £300 million ($3.94 billion) in its third cost-cutting project to revitalize its business, which has been hit hard by the rapid growth of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its shares in Penguin Landen Bookstore to its partner, Bethesmann, and reported that its basic sales rose 1% in the first half to £20.5 billion, but that the outlook remained unchanged this year.
A few days ago, the China Athletics Association issued a serious and serious notice, severely replacing the phenomenon and preparing to impose a life-long ban on non-compliant athletes.
NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing of convoy in Kabul
According to official reports, a military convoy encountered suicide bombers in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Kalabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan - the blast at the Khartoum mosque on Tuesday killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A joint Afghan and NATO patrol was attacked by "individuals carrying light explosive devices" during an explosion late Thursday, according to a NATO statement.
The statement said all injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. hospital at Baghram Air Force Base.
The rise of the Taliban and the so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region, according to reporters, has raised serious concerns among NATO troops stationed near Baghdad.
According to United Nations statistics, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 while the capital accounted for about 20%.
At least 30 people were killed in a suicide car bombing at the end of July in a Shiite-dominated area of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed to have launched the attack.
On 31 May, a massive explosion in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, was the deadliest armed attack in the country since the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban by US-led multinational forces.
The violence highlighted US President Donald Trump’s balancing act on whether to increase troops in Afghanistan to support its army and police as the country’s security situation was threatened.
According to reporters, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies, particularly the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The United States National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturned the resolution after the lawsuit and delayed the smoke regulations
When Obama took office, he demanded that states curb all kinds of emissions of smoke, and fifteen states filed lawsuits against the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which overturned the lawsuit one day later.
The U.S. Environmental Bureau announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called "2015 Ozone Target Area" and pledged to work with states.
In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State for the Environment Scott Pruitt said, "We are confident in the dialogue with our national partners and committed to responding to them.
Pruit announced in June that the EPA plans to postpone the implementation of the ozone-depleting zone standard to October 2018, with a one-year delay - based on the standard, to measure existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce the emissions of smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits Tuesday alleging that the act was illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump’s authorities have been working to restore environmental regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservatives, who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
Breathing ozone-depleting air "would reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma," the Environmental Protection Agency said on its website.

Mackey Garcia and Vasily Lomagino met for the first time to discuss the possible future of a decisive battle
The most remarkable under 147-pound boxing match will be held shortly afterwards, with Vasily Lomagino and Mickey Garcia, who are currently in a potential conflict, meeting for the first time Thursday.
In their separate room at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion Garcia took the lead in taking the corridor to address the World Boxing Organization's superflyweight champion, Lomaquinco.
At Saturday's Showtime boxing match, the judges unanimously ruled that Garcia had defeated quarter-finalist Adrian Bruno to win, and that the two boxers had become the top five in the weight class.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "Champion, how are you
Good luck to you.
In an ESPN match at 7 p.m. on Saturday night, Lomagino defeated Miguel Mariaga to maintain his position.
When the two were photographed, Logachenko's agent, Eugene Clemas, pointed out that the potential match between the two players depended on "the perfect size".
"I used to be lightweight," Garcia said.
"I've upgraded to fight against Bruno (140 lbs), but I'm not that heavy.
My weight is a little less than 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he had to reach the lightweight level (135 lbs) before we could fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we'll satisfy them.
Lomanchenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight.
Clemas asked whether he should be charged on a quarterly basis, and part of his strategy was to have Lomaquinco play his first show against a 135-pound player later this year, thinking of a date for next summer with Garcia (37-0,30 knockouts), and Garcia was also interested in a match against the winner of the fight against Jorge Linares-Luc Campbell after the September 23 Forum Lightweight Boxing championship.
"Because all the fans are asking this question, the fight might be a one-off," Garcia said, after which he expressed openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial solutions.
"We are the main actors.
It is impossible for anyone else to raise so much attention.
As long as they're ready . . .
Garcia praised Loma琴co as "an excellent player" and may have watched his boxing match on Saturday.
However, Lombardo has hesitated to praise Garcia, saying he thinks the three-way champion from Riverside looks "very slow. Sorry, Mickey ... you'll be eliminated.
Garcia said the focus was on showing the strength of the hand, and then on boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing matches.
"This is a battle that must be fought,
Attention and enthusiasm are unmatched in other boxing competitions.
I'm very happy to participate," Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for top-notch fighters, and this time it's Mackey," he said.
This will be a great battle.
Promoting Environmental Protection Yesterday, the West Township organized a large-scale environmental volunteer service theme event called "Green Homes to Promote West Township"
Unlike the traditional way of picking up garbage and distributing promotional materials, the organizers have set up six gaming experience areas, including water-saving bucket displays, enzyme production experiences, and transportation dominoes.
At present, many children in the country have dropped out of school because of the goal of being a professional golfer, and on the career path are walking smoothly, no longer considering college.
The officials of the Chinese Commission for Development and Cooperation (CDC) have expressed strong expectations of a return to production in the steel industry, which is subject to electricity-limited production pressures, as a result of the early completion of the emissions reduction targets of 11.5 per cent.
Although the steel mills have not received a clear notification from the local government that the energy saving and emission reduction work has been completed, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the steel mills that were originally restricted to production will be restarted and the price of steel will start to rise.
Notifications of the end of electricity production limits have not yet been received, but the pressure on companies has actually increased since September and October, a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have issued limit electricity production documents several times, and once adopted a forced locking method to limit enterprise production.
The local enterprises learned that most of the steel plants in Hebei have been rebuilt and the production pressure has eased.
Zhang Teishan, an analyst for my steel network, predicts that terminal demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter is approaching in the north.
Additionally, the phase-out of energy saving and emissions will be phased out, and by December 15 most steel plants will be fully re-established, with products reaching markets around the world before New Year's Eve.
The increase in the supply of resources will put pressure on steel prices which are currently on the rise.
"We are recruiting people, and the future of smart cars will be a very important business for ChinaXing Communications," a spokesman for ChinaXing Communications said on December 20, saying ChinaXing Communications has acquired a 70% stake in the Zhuhai-Guangtong passenger car network and has formed a team of smart cars based on it.

He proposed to launch a pilot project with China in three areas: industrial waste treatment, waste oil treatment and waste incineration treatment equipment, and hoped to extend the experience of environmental cooperation with China to other parts of the world.
Latest results of Swedish Refugee Age Assessment Tests Announced
The latest results show that more than 80% of the subjects were judged to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Legal Medicine (Rttsmedicinalverket) started the test earlier this year.
After the alleged failure to accurately assess the age of some alleged minor refugees, the Swedish Migration Office (Migrationsverket) designed these tests in order to make a more accurate assessment of the age during the process of asylum.
To date, the Swedish Immigration Office has sent 6880 test cases, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has published the results of a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002 people) were found to be 18 years of age or older, but in the other 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Legal Medicine also found the subjects to be "probably 18 years of age or older".
In 432 tests, the result was that the person was "probably under 18 years of age".
The test is only for people with age-related questions.
According to John Grantson of the Centre for Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: "These figures are not too different from those of the previous months, and they are very consistent.
The high proportion of cases found to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that these refugees lied about their age.
In May, the Centre released the results of 581 tests and said that 442 of them "show that the subject is over 18 years of age or older".
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests, and found that 243 of the subjects had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
An X-ray examination of the wisdom teeth, a nuclear magnetic resonance scan of the joints, and an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists are some of the areas where this method of medical assessment is questioned.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist C. Marcus of the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity in order to determine whether they experience puberty earlier or later than normal age.
"I have a reason to think so," he told the Metro newspaper, "and I don't think the method of measuring should be that way.
It is not accurate to determine physiological age in this way.
If we can't guarantee accuracy, we shouldn't pretend we can.
Grantson of the Centre for Forensic Medicine, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can generally be said that the uncertainty about whether a child is an adult is very small.
The greatest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, which is about 10%.
Governors of West Virginia Announce Change of Party

Sebastian Cox praises Russia's "truthful" apology for the doping scandal
On Thursday, the president of the International Athletic Federation Sebastian Coe praised Russia's apology for the doping scandal and said it was "truthful", but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to rejoin the sport.
Speaking on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, the president of the Russian Federation of Athletics, Mitri Shiraktin, said it was right for his country to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were denied medals.
In spite of his comments, the IOC voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which was implemented in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) cited evidence that Russian countries had supported the use of doping.
"I think today's response is very frank, a very frank introduction," IOC Chairman Ko told reporters.
"The whole Council and the Paralympic Games are delighted ... the Russian Federation recognises that it has gone through a very heated period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can rejoin the competition.
Ko said he was also "happy" that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think we've made some progress, but the General Assembly supports the Panel's proposal and it's not the time to restore Russia's qualifications," Ko said.
"We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
Our guiding principle has always been to want white athletes to be separated from polluted systems," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday, according to the International Athletics Federation's strict criteria.

People's National Currency Intermediate Price 6.4401 depreciates 66 basis points
Macroeconomics Tencent Financial 2018-01-18 09:50 share
On January 18, Tencent Financial News reported that the renminbi had dropped 66 base points from the previous trading day to 6.4401 against the US dollar, ending its previous five consecutive rise.
The next night, the dollar warmed back, and the dollar index moved out of the V-shaped form, reporting 90.8900 as of 7:30 p.m. on Beijing time.
Almost all of the 12 Fed regions reported moderate to moderate growth in economic activity at the beginning of 2018, and are optimistic about the outlook for the year, according to the Fed's brown paper on the economy.
Meanwhile, unemployment in the United States remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and firms are expected to raise wages in the coming months.
Federal Reserve officials generally believe that tax changes are a factor in supporting this moderately strong economic outlook, with the Fed forecasting 3.5% growth in 2018 and a three-fold interest rate hike.
Market analysts pointed out that recently, the ECB's monetary policy has tightened expectations to push up the euro, the dollar index has been sliding steadily, and the renminbi's appreciation against the dollar has risen rapidly. However, it is unlikely that the ECB's policy position will be adjusted quickly, and that after short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets, it will eventually return to the basics, and that it is highly likely that the exchange rate will continue to operate smoothly.
It is noteworthy that as the market expects the renminbi to become more stable, the attractiveness of the renminbi assets to foreign investors is also gradually highlighted.
On January 18, 2018, the Central Bank of China (CBC) authorized China's exchange-rate trading center to announce that the interbank exchange rate of the renminbi was: 1 dollar to renminbi 6.4401 yuan, 1 euro to renminbi 7.8482 yuan, 100 yen to renminbi 5.7854 yuan, 1 Hong Kong dollar to renminbi 0.82399 yuan, 1 pound to renminbi 8.9017 yuan, 1 Australian dollar to renminbi 5.1302 yuan, 1 New Zealand dollar to renminbi 4.6779 yuan, 1 Singapore dollar to renminbi 4.8546 yuan, 1 Swiss franc to renminbi 6.6731 yuan, 1 Canadian dollar to renminbi 5.1747 yuan, Renminbi 1 yuan to 0.61399 Malaysian Lingit, Renminbi 1 yuan to 8.835

How will the financial rules affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris?
Rules aimed at preventing European football clubs from being unrestricted on spending will not hinder the transfer of Real from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), France, at record prices.
The result was a further downgrade by the European Football Association (UEFA) of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, which is the governing body of European football and has the right to prohibit teams from participating in the much-discussed Champions League.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules (FFP), introduced by UEFA in 2011, mean that Paris Saint-Germain FC will ultimately have to prove that Nemar’s transfer is funded and does not cause huge losses.
Barcelona have already paid €2.2 billion ($2.62 billion) just to pay for the Brazilian player's dismissal, and Nemal's salary will reach millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of the transfer of Namor to France.
Given that the team's money comes from the wealthy Qatari ruling family, the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club can of course sign Nemar in cash and include him in the other stars' squad.
Clubs can spend large sums to buy players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the large sums they have spent to balance the profits and losses in their football-related business.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were proposed by Michel Platini, who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believes that for clubs that are in debt for success, if banks or everyone withdraws their support, they are in fact cheating and putting the club at risk of ruin.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from the issue of club debt to the monitoring of club losses.
The change means that Roman Abramovich, who used the business model of buying Chelsea in 2003 – buying a potential club, then spending a lot of money on improving the team and building it into a global brand – is now facing a harder situation.
During the three-year rule review period up to 2018, the club could lose €30 million.
Despite Abe’s devaluation in 2015 by his predecessor, UEFA’s successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course, the Rules are not broken, and we are sure that we will strengthen the rules in the future,” Andrea Traverso of the UEFA, which is in charge of rules-related affairs, told the United States last week.
Although the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. will pay out the buy-out terms of the club once and for all, it can also allocate amounts within the contract period for accounting purposes.
Nemal has already signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee could appear in the next five years' annual accounts at a cost of €44.4 million.
The first wave of rules sanctions in 2014 put the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and Abu Dhabi's Manchester City Club under the most severe sanctions.
The Paris Saint-Germain F.C. was fined €6 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €2 million, and was asked to reduce the team to 21 players in the 2014–15 Champions League instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is staring at clubs that try to deceive financial regulators by increasing revenues by linking them to their owners.
Although Qatari companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club, if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market price, UEFA will not consider it to be a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of the Qatar Tourist Board's support for the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was exaggerated.
It is reported that some of Nemar's income from the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club may come from the 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifiers.
But both the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and its governing board denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, a move that would be easy for UEFA’s regulators.
The recent sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain means that UEFA will be more vigilant about any attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA has not had a preliminary discussion with Paris Saint-Germain on the transfer of Nemar, people familiar with the matter said Thursday.
The above-mentioned persons only made contact with the United States of America anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
The last published accounts show that the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. had a turnover of €542.4 billion in 2015-16, earning more than €10 million.
The accounts for the previous accounting year have not been published.
The Paris Saint-Germain F.C. expects Nemar's membership to bring the gospel to sponsorship activities, concessions and the sale of soccer jerseys.
The club expects revenues to increase by at least 30% after the signing of Naimar.
Obviously, seeing the most famous of them leave, the Spanish League was angry, trying to obstruct Nemal's move, and claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain F.C. violated the rules.
"This is an obvious example of a 'financial stimulus,' the club and the country are the same," the club's chairman, Javier Tabasco, told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar, which is ultimately owned by the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who is the owner of the all-American sports giant, has reservations about the state-funded club, as well as about the Western League.
"This is the consequence of ownership and it has changed the whole ecosystem of football completely in the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the country owns a club, then something will happen.
This will make it very difficult to comply with the rules, because there are many different ways or interests for a country to require players to represent a country.
Smart Interactive Robotics R&D Vendor, Rookid, Receives New Investment from AMT
In recent years, startups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be attracted to capital.
The artificial intelligence robot has just completed a new round of financing, which is being co-invested by Aomasi, Swiss Credit, CDIB (the investment firm of Taiwan's China Development Financial Holding Company), old shareholder IDG Capital, and others.
It is reported that this round of financing is worth about $100 million, and Rishimbun and CDIB appeared for the first time in domestic financing transactions in the field of artificial intelligence.
Rokid is an intelligent interactive robot research and development company, dedicated to robotics research, the product can control smart devices in the home, has continuous autonomous learning and growth functions, also has recognition, understanding, feedback, etc.
This round of financing will mainly be used for R&D, recruitment of talent, strategic promotion and investment layout of industry chains.
In August 2014, it received $830 million in angel round investments from IDG, Linear Capital, Mfund, and Yuan Qian Capital; in October 2015, the company received $1,000 million in A round investments from Warner International and the angel investors; and on November 1, 2016, it completed B round investments from Shanghai Capital, IDG, Mfund, Yuan Qian Capital, and Warner International.
At the time, Rokid said the company's valuation had reached $4.5 billion after the B round of financing.
In May 2017, Rookid released the consumer-grade smart voice robot "Joki Moonstone", which combines artificial intelligence with a home scene, for a price of $13,999.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language comprehension, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology. It has chat conversation, play music, and intelligent home functions.

The film's premiere was held in Wuhan on 25th April, with the film's director Zhuo Zhuo, the film's animated director Mun Wise, the film's music producer and Emmy Award winner TomDisher appearing on the scene to share the film's behind-the-scenes story.
The story of Liu An, the Han Dynasty Huainan King of China's traditional culture, departs from the traditional roots of Liu An making tofu, because it was made by mistake, and tells the story of the main character Liu An, who was transformed by a bean into an adult figure, overcoming heavy difficulties, and insisting on the dream of Shusen.
It is one of the world cultural heritage sites of the United Nations, and is the source of Taoist culture and martial arts.
Director Zhou revealed that in the early days of the film's creation, he had traveled to Mount Budan with the main production team.
He said that the story of "Beu Fu" happened during the time of Emperor Wu of Sichuan, in the background of Huainan King Liu An alchemy, the protagonist of the film "Beu Fu" is a bean who accidentally hallucinated adult form when Liu An alchemy.
In addition to Wudan Mountain, the source of Taoist culture, Hubei has a deep roots in China's long-established traditional instrument, the composing clock.

The novel, which was written in 1934, is Cao Yu's first work, a sign of the maturity of modern Chinese drama, and is the most widely translated Chinese drama in the world.
"Ha啦 Summer Camp" and "The Detective Twins"
The retelling of the story is intended to commemorate actors of the glorious 80s and the garbage era of the 90s (before and after David Wayne and Michael Shuworth produced the MTV animated comedy National); it is also a nostalgia for themselves, a nostalgia for 2001, a year before many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pollock, and Paul Rudd had not yet caught fire.
As a cultural art, it is the imitation and embodiment of the permanent memory of our Facebook age.
But as a series, it feels like time is not enough.
Camp One Day resonated strongly after airing, but not only because of its absurd humour (the plot is an original story about a talking vegetable can, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
Due to the double use of core laughter in the plot – middle-aged actors playing children of the right age – it is also a funny part of not being able to go back to the past.
In Ten Years Later, adults actually act as adults, with emotions that are not too deeply rooted, and imitations that are more diffuse, including improvisations for film tracks of the 1990s, such as "Moving the Hands of a Rocking Cradle".
At some point, a character falls into an Apple laptop, some straight skates, and "something else from 1991".
Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweetheart (Mr. Shuwart) has now become a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie (Margaret Morrow).
Victor (Ken Mario) still retains his manhood.
There is also another sinister plot involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Shuwart), suggested by George H.W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Blake, who left a deep impression).
As usual, the best part of this series is the interlude.
It's especially interesting to see Mr. Road, who was always young, and who showed off Matt Dilon's soul patch in The Lonely Nobleman, and Andy in the previous Campus Giant now feels like a giant.
It's a moment of random madness that might give the film momentum, like the recurring Seven Years of Life series, until I come to what I think is a logical conclusion: The Ha-Ha Camp: Twenty Years Later, its last act is to have the cast of the cast go to the Ha-Ha Camp film premiere.
Meanwhile, Amazon's Detective Twins speaks of different nostalgic contents: the Cold War Revivalist American Spy Dream, the film The Cold City, and even the Eastern Wrestling-inspired GLOW: Women's Wrestling League.
The comedy created by Brian Gatwood and Alexander Tanaka, directed by Reese Thomas, is set in the 1980s in Romania and tells the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninist line.
The main characters – the hard-line Gregory and the idealist Arthur – are played by little Florian Piercey and Cornelia Ulich, respectively, and their dialogues are voiced in English by Channing Tatum (who is also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
But this is not just an idea.
There are some good visual stunts (police watches chess playing on TV because Americans like to play football).
Moreover, numerous famous voice actors – including Jenny Stretch, Nick Hoffman, Mahshala Hashbaz Ali, and Kolo Savini – have created a glorious sound ceremony.
But Detective Two is so committed to creating a lively, realistic promotional comedy – one in which there is a killer with a hairdress – that it often plays the same role.
The six-episode television was a bit slow, and the comedy effects were not released quickly or often enough.
The film's director was more rigorous in editing, and when Gregory and Arthur repeatedly visited the U.S. embassy, it had a better satire effect, as there were always two fat guys in the embassy's lobby who swallowed a bunch of hamburgers.
For imaginary communist audiences, this information means that Western culture can make anything into a material to cheer on.
The creators of this fictional story about Romania are not wrong, and we can even use our own modern history and their history to tell stories.
In recent interviews, reporters learned that profits from industries such as steel, railway transport, shipbuilding and mechanical manufacturing in the northeast region have generally declined, and even lost.
Some experts believe that in the current situation, the renewed revival of Northeast industry not only has to do with the national economic recovery, but also has an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
The overall decline in profits of enterprises in the traditional industries has resulted in more and more losses in raw materials industries and heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing. The decline in profits has even resulted in losses, which is the first sign of the Northeast industries in this round of economic downturn.
In the past, the downward trend was characterized mainly by the impact of low-end and primary products, but in this economic fluctuation, the Northeast traditional high-end and low-end industrial products were affected.
Over the past few years, the Kura Steel Group has been focusing on the development of high-end boards such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and household electrical boards by adjusting its product structure.However, sales of these varieties have declined considerably this year, with shipboard sales falling by 50% compared to the same period last year.
Shandong Steel Co., Ltd. ( Liaoning Province Labour and Welfare Commission Metallurgy Department Director Hao Qing Shun) said that metallurgy is Liaoning's third-largest pillar industry and ranks third in the country with an annual steel production of 60 million tons.
In January-May of this year, the production of copper steel in Liaoning province amounted to 21.54 million tons, and the situation of production and sales of the products required by national policy encouragement and large-scale local government construction projects was better. The sharp decline in the market competition of the products was another characteristic of the Northeast manufacturing industry.

Yesterday, a press conference was held in Beijing on "Hawkward Four Oceans Come to You" for the upcoming August 4th screening of the film "Thirty-three Princes and Ten Miles of Peach Flowers," with the "White Night Couples" Yang Yang and Liu Xianfei on stage.
Yang Yang, who had just undergone right ear surgery a few days ago, appeared for the first time after the injury, and he interpreted his role as "invisible anger," always silently for white and white, hiding all emotions in the heart.
"It's a new challenge for me to perform, and in the process, I'm really going to feel the pain inside," Yang said.
Liu also revealed that he had "shut up" when performing the film, crying to his death.
The Olympic Committee of Japan recently said that Japan's team had set a goal of 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and would advance to third place in the gold medal standings.
Last October, the chairman of the Japan Olympic Committee's sports committee, Yasuhiro Yamashita, said he expects the total number of gold medals to be 2.5 times that of the Rio Olympics.
At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, Japan finished sixth in the gold medal table with 12 gold medals.
The representatives joined their own team, holding their umbrellas, and stepped into the stadium.
The roads around the stadium are normally clear. There are no balloon signs outside the stadium, no red carpets, no plants and flowers.
Yesterday, the second session of the Fourth People's Congress of Guangyang City was held in a simple manner.
There were no signs, no cups of tea, and not even a bottle of ordinary mineral water.
Instead, a simple rectangle, a meeting place, a simple paper bag with meeting materials, and a cup of green paper filled with tea.
The conference material was thinner than before and several papers summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
"We understand and welcome the fact that we are returning to a simple and genuine meeting environment," said Wang Cheng, deputy deputy for Guang An City, adding that they are willing to see and participate in efficient, pragmatic and non-formal meetings.
Experts point out that the current inflation and deflationary pressures have eased, which is undoubtedly good news for the financial transition.

The Bank of England will maintain an interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and loose inflation have driven up expectations.
The Bank of England has issued a warning that economic growth will continue to be “weak” as it tightens household income cuts while controlling interest rates.
Policymakers at the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided by a 6-2 vote to maintain interest rates of 0.25%, while a minority of members this month called for higher rates, even if weak economic growth has weakened the boost.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England lowered growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that household income deflation would continue, while inflation would surge to close to 3% in the autumn.
But it says higher interest rates will be needed over the next few years to curb inflation from leaving the EU, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more substantially than expected in financial markets.
A year ago, under the influence of departure from Europe, a large-scale economic stimulus policy was implemented and members voted to withdraw it.
Bank of England will announce the suspension of its regular financing plan to provide low-cost funds to banks starting in February next year, although the bank says it will now need an additional £150 billion on the basis of £1150 billion under the plan.
"In the core forecast of MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near future, as household real income constraints will continue to stifle consumption," the Bank of England said in a recorded interest rate decision-making meeting.
As for interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for "a certain monetary-policy tightening" to curb inflation and "to a greater extent" than market expectations.
The current market is expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year and for the second time in 2020.
But the line emphasizes that any upgrading will be "slow" and "controlled".
The Bank's growth forecasts for this year and next year are on a downward trend, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% in May.
The bank maintains a 1.8% growth forecast for 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to 1.31 against the dollar and 0.4% to 1.11 against the euro.
Until the emergence of this unchanged decision, increasingly high expectations were shattered by recent unfavourable growth figures, with GDP rising to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter compared to only 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter could remain at 0.3%, although it will rise slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households have been hit by inflationary surges, while wage growth has been inadequate, and the Bank of England's recent inflation report does not bring them much good news, as it says that austerity will get worse before it gets better.
He also said monetary policy could not "prevent" a hit on incomes over the next few years, but wages are expected to return to a "massive" level by the end of the three-year forecast.
Meanwhile, as the pound depreciates and demand for British goods increases dramatically, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
A year before the decision was made, a shocking EU referendum plunged the pound and lowered interest rates to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates it may take four years to fully affect prices and the UK economy.
The Bank's calls for interest rates to be raised were heard before its latest rate ruling, as inflation hits ordinary households that have already experienced double the pressure, and three policymakers called for an interest rate hike of 0.5% in July.
Last month's inflation dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank says the overshoot of its 2% target is already the final bottom line for the weak pound.
Andrew Monterec, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in maturity rates, mortgage markets seem to be becoming more competitive once again, as lenders are strongly calling for more business and expect a positive turnaround this year.
Such a market seems particularly favourable to those who are likely to close existing transactions soon, as re- mortgages (many of which can be free of formalities and at low interest rates) are becoming more popular.

The National Health Service System (NHS) is turning the spotlight on controversial AIDS drugs
Patients will be able to receive “transformative” HIV prevention treatment starting in September, once the High Court has ruled on the NHS’s drug subsidies.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prevention drug (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk groups by about 86%.
It agreed to provide funding for the trial after the Court of Appeal backed the High Court's ruling last year, which stated that although the NHS claimed that local authorities should provide funding for the drug, the NHS was entitled to pay for PrEP.
The move, announced Thursday, has been described by British NHS chief executive Simon Stevens as a “major new intervention” and by the National AIDS Trust Foundation (NAT) as a “critical moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to be registered. More clinics will be added in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention medication (PrEP) is an HIV medication that is taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Tests have shown that PREP can significantly reduce the spread of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Prescribing PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are sufficient specific drugs in the body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
Those eligible for treatment include gay, bisexual, transgender, and unsuccessful HIV positives.
The clinic will determine whether participants who meet the conditions and agree to the test, including men, women, transgender people and their sexual partners, are HIV-infected and unknown individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy.
Persons residing in England and registered as general practitioners can also register at their local sex health clinics.
The plan will cost £10 million, and NHS's England branch has signed a contract to purchase the drugs this week after conducting international competitive procurement.
The aim of the experiment is to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how to locate, absorb, and implement it on the basis of large samples.
"This major new intervention should play a broad and increasingly successful complementary and reinforcing role in AIDS prevention," Mr Stevens said.
This is yet another milestone in 30 years of action worth making progress in addressing major human health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against AIDS," said Dibora King, chief executive of the British AIDS Trust Fund (NAT).
If it is indeed targeted at people who are in need and at risk, pre-exposure medications offer the potential to change the UK’s AIDS epidemic.
From September onwards, the NHS-funded trial, conducted in England, will give high-risk people with HIV access to a new, authorized tool that can be implemented on their own, without consulting sexual partners, and which will improve the lives of many more people.
We endorse the announcement with our hands.
"The primary task now is to ensure that the trials are rapidly launched across the country and that none of the HIV-infected can fall," said Ian Green, chief executive of the Trans-Higgins Trust Foundation.
Now that we have purchased the PrEP test drug, we are ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of AIDS."
"After months of delays and government delays, the start of PrEP's initial trial is very welcome and should come sooner," said Changshalong Hodgson of the Shadow Public Health Department.
Evidence shows how these drugs can bring about change as part of the way we prevent AIDS and stop the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This test will enable us to understand the advantages of PrEP more fully and further.
It is very important to launch this test as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to help us further stop the spread of HIV in society."

High Quality Living: Applying lofts and ingenious designs to make the count's small apartment a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was keen to renovate the house, and moved from the large house at Knightsbridge to a small apartment at the Earl's Palace in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a elegant Anne Queen-style show - and Joannie didn't pack her luggage to sell it, which is a powerful proof of the new design.
"Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on Knight's Bridge," said Joanne.
"I was looking for a house that matched the offer.
I saw this apartment in the count's palace. Its ceiling was also high.
I'm looking forward to making an appointment that day.
The 1,000-square-foot apartment has been thoroughly renovated since its first visit.
The apartment was originally a complex single room with a complex layout -- it needed to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to add storage space and attic to make full use of the sufficient ceiling height.
"I want a high ceiling, big windows and plenty of light.
That's my request," she said.
To this end, she hired Elvan Azadi of Duck&Shed Architecture and Design Studio, located on Mt. Notting, to use the 12.5-foot ceiling to create a home that is not only a development project, but also a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to increase the two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge is to create a loft high enough to stand.
Elvan must be creative in order to solve the problem.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We have to arrange a good space for it to be displayed up and down, and we don't have to bow our shoulders.
Not only is the construction of a simple platform so simple, but also the activation of these steels in order to make them at the appropriate altitude for the performance of the functions.
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to have two rooms in the space that were all-heightened -- many of which could add a lot of hobby elements.
The attic features retrouvius-branded bronze windows overlooking the charming residential area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille retro lighting laid the foundations for the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
Put a mirror on both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splash screens with mirrors are like windows to another room.
At the basement, a small compartment with mirrors provides a storage space for Joannie to store dishes and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an appealing sense of space, which can be taken away when the kitchen is not in use.
The folding kitchen is not fresh.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen is a garage-style elevator door.
"This involves some engineering knowledge," Elvan explains to the reinforced reinforced MDF door.
It's based on the principle of balance, so it's easy to slide when you push the door.
Thanks to the ingenious use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, what you're selling is the area of the house -- or your property's valuation is based on the area of the house," Elvan said.
"In principle, real estate agents go into rooms and calculate according to the size of the floors.
They will try to increase the occupancy of the space, while using quality materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
"The materials are chosen by you," Elvan said, "so it helps to create emotional bonds at home."
"You won't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they won't hold your heartstrings.
It turns out that by designing well and adding extra space, standard apartments can be amazingly shaky.
In fact, you might choose to stay, just like Joanne.

The two brothers staged a $5 billion real estate empire war
Forty years after the founding of the Italian family, the two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $5 billion.
Colin De Lutis, former Carlton football club director and developer, lives in a luxurious house in Tuscany, three doors away from where his brother Paul lives, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over the division of their real estate and business assets.
Since 2014, Paul has been hoping to get out of the family business, but the two brothers have been engaged in fierce arguments in the Supreme Court over the asset split.
The brothers and their mother owned a total of 38 properties worth more than $500 million, which have accumulated since the family purchased Smith Street in Collinswood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded to 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
The money was then invested in real estate. Currently, the de Rutis family's portfolio includes urban office buildings, the Brunwick and Soronto developments, Golden Coast and Bluff apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement reached with his deceased father, Corin, who was called the "principal promoter and dominant figure" of his brother Paul, owns about two-thirds of the company assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
The documents submitted to the court stated that the value of the property owned by Collins was $3.16 billion on balance and that Paul's was $1.76 billion on balance.
Paul argued that the division of real estate and cash proved to be a negotiating problem.
“The property division proposal put forward by Colin leaves him what I consider to be his best asset,” he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed conciliations.
Now the two brothers are fighting for control of the existing company and Paul says Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Collins denied this and accused Paul of failing to manage some real estate.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he said he hoped to settle the dispute.
“My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option. My Italian ancestry determines that family is the most important,” he wrote.
The cost of the case is rising, and there are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and company reports submitted by top law firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allen Myers, QC, and senior lawyers hired by both parties.
Ms. de Rutis and her deceased husband Luigi, both Italian immigrants, began to operate mass restaurants and taverns in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used mortgages to buy Corinwood property, where Corin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin said, "I read at three o'clock in the morning," where he founded Westco, "when Paul was very young (about ten years old).
Anna de Rutis said she and Louisie, who died in 2012, hoped to be able to pass on the property peacefully to her son
" Louisie often told me that he never hoped that the brothers would finally come to court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of the De Rutis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10,000 when he left the company, and he paid Luke $26 million.
Paul said Luke and Mark "expressed dissatisfaction with their property division clause".
According to a biography published in 2015 by television star Eddie McGuire, though Collins was a former board member of the AFL club, he remained low-key.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
But only Colin responded by texting, saying "I really can't say too much," as the case has been referred to the court.
"My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family matters to court, which was very, very sad," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Collins wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father doesn't want to see Paul and I finally have this kind of dispute," he said, adding that he "still has hope for a solution to the dispute."
On Friday, this hope seemed to have vanished.
"Our problems will be resolved in the near future through the courts," Collins wrote.

Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit President’s media time
Others have tried, but all have failed.
John F. Kelly might actually be able to do that.
If that's true, he's the first one.
According to the US political news website Politico, the new White House secretary-general plans to limit the flow of information to Trump – including news reports – in order to ensure greater stability for bosses.
The following is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Secretary John F. Kelly began his first day of work meeting with senior officials, he pointed out that he was addressing one of the main issues Trump faces in the White House: the flow of bad information to the president."
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helped the president make better decisions, and that information needed to go through his hands—whether in written form or in brief form.
Kelly’s diagnosis was similar, but others tried to tame him by watching Trump’s media time, and ultimately failed.
President Trump’s TV addiction is long-established – now in the White House, his habit of watching television is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico, "If candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be very helpful for him to know that he has received positive reporting on his credible channels as well."
Tara Palmery of Politico wrote at the time, "According to the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump's Twitter habits is on ensuring that the media information he receives personally always contains a certain amount of praise."
That's no problem at all.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habits have been “controlled” is laughable.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don’t – that without their intervention, Trump’s tweets would be even more inflammatory.
We may never know what tweets Trump hasn’t sent.
If his staff were able to rescue him from the water fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worthwhile.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from sparking controversy.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that, in a White House made up of competing groups, people promote their worldviews and flower their cause by passing on information that may or may not be credible to Trump.
Politico -- all about the story -- reported in May on the advisors' preference for providing suspicious information to the president strategically.
This is an example described by journalist Sean Goodmancher:
“The current and former Trump officials say that Trump’s reaction to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those that leak destructive information, would be crazy to find its source.
At the end of February, the president was maliciously reprinted an article on the Internet-instigator Charles C. Johnson’s website GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Secretary of State Katy Walsh of being “the source of massive leaks of information” to the White House, as Trump did at the time.
Even though Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, he did not provide any concrete evidence, and he had issued numerous false accusations, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and then began to ask officials about Walsh.
Goodmancher also said that then-secretary-general Reins Priebass and White House secretary Robert Potter "had tried to establish a system for managing and recording documents received by Trump".
What's the result?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
He may prove to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is the impulsive Trump, and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These eternal influences will make Kelly's task more difficult.
Tourist Atmosphere Town: How the Atmosphere Enchants Travellers
The potential of Zhejiang town was gradually awakened.
Nowadays, these small towns have become important destinations for tourists to enjoy Zhejiang mountain water, read Zhejiang culture, and feel Zhejiang countryside worries, and will also provide important assistance to the province's efforts to create "Picture Zhejiang" China's most beautiful tourist destinations.

The beauty of the tourism scenery of the town, not only stems from the streams of small bridges covered with smoke and rain, but also from a long cultural tradition; rural revival, stems from cultural confidence.
Internationally, the Dutch town of Lesser, the Austrian town of Halstadt, and the French town of pumpkins, respectively, attract a large number of tourists from all over the world each year, focusing on tulip, "salt" and pumpkins as the main attractions to boost the economy of the town.

Passengers negotiate the ditch and return to the Rich Street
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands once again clashed with determined cab drivers who negotiated a government-excavated ditch and demanded the return of land outside their homes.
The tenants parked their 20 trailers on an empty lot outside the bustling Solihler Street, which is nicknamed the "Rickety Street".
The cab drivers, carrying horses, embracing babies and leading the cab crew, returned again after being driven away in May, but the city department's dug "protective city river" did not stop them from entering.
The experienced team found that there was a gap in the road's defence line, and although there was a section of the road that did not have roadblocks to pass through, their vehicles crowded through the gap.
The angry residents fiercely criticised the Salihull Council for its "very poor performance in dealing with the issue".
One unknown resident said, "They were there on Monday night, and before they came to Binlichis Street, they threw stones at the passersby.
The Committee should be ashamed of their deeds, for there is virtually no place for them to deal with the problem.
The cabbies came here in May, then they were driven away, and now they are back.
There were a lot of them last night, and there may be more today.
She added, "The Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with it by implementing a long-term ban to protect its parks.
I live on Streetbrook Street, and I wouldn't want to continue paying municipal taxes if the parliament couldn't stop it.
"It's ridiculous," said a local resident who refused to reveal his name. "We've just seen the last group of cab drivers leave, but the next group will destroy them.
This time the number increased again, and people even saw a horse on the park lawn eating grass.
A spokeswoman for the Solihler Commission said: "We know that there was an unlicensed hike in an open area of Spreadbruck Road, and we are now working with the Solihler police and taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal acts to the police by calling 101.
This will help us to get an overview of the case before the courts for review.

Italy takes tough on non-governmental migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue rescue operations without signing new operational management regulations.
"If non-governmental organizations don't sign new codes of conduct, it's hard to see what they're going to do next," Interior Minister Marco Minetti told the Dublin Daily News.
On the day before the warning in Minneapolis, Italian officials detained him for suspecting that the crew on a ship of the German aid organisation "Youth Rescue" was actually involved in trafficking in human beings and assisting illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of the allegations made by Italian prosecutor Antonio Caltosio.
"Saving lives now is, and will be, the most important thing for us, so we regret not being able to operate in the search and rescue area now," the organization said in a social media statement.
"After collecting all the information, we can only assess all the allegations and the situation at the moment.
Italian officials have been monitoring the vessel Iuventa, a youth rescue organisation, since October.
Its crews were suspected of carrying immigrants who had been smuggled directly by small boats, and allowed smugglers to flee hastily and re-use the ships.
According to the prosecutor's record, at least one such meeting was alleged to have taken place at sea 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, and the contents of the document were published by the Italian media.
Its crew is alleged to be openly disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons rather than for any other motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian policeman to oversee their activities on board.
At present, of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in the search and rescue operations, only three have agreed to comply with the code of conduct, respectively: the Save the Children Association, headquartered at the Migrant Maritime Assistance Station in Maldives, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new provisions unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any "significant changes and obstacles" to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minetti said that the sudden drop in the number of immigrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks indicated that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and to unite local mayors had started to bear fruit.
"In the last few days, we have started to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for this month's in-depth talks: to discuss economic development activities with the mayors of Libya, and to discuss how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave those countries to go to Europe with Chad, Nigeria and Mali.

Although industrial production will be weaker than in October, it is essentially the same as in November.
In December, China's manufacturing investment was low, but infrastructure investment improved slightly, and fixed asset investment is expected to be equal to November this month.
More than 200,000 people entered the United States, mostly smugglers; living abroad, returning home indefinitely, separated relatives, similar scenes continue to occur.
Beijing's New "Higher School Disengagement" Initiative: Tens of Thousands of Students and Teachers of North Chemistry to Enter Changping New School District
The inauguration ceremony of the new campus of Beijing Chemical University took place in Changping District, Beijing. The green campus, which covers 1800 acres, was officially launched.
In order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and manage the "big city disease", in recent years, in the context of the co-development and evacuation of non-capital functions in Kyushu and Jiangxi, Beijing has accelerated the evacuation of central city universities to suburban areas, and some university faculty and students are gradually moving to new school districts in suburban areas such as Shun Yi, Taixing and Fushan.
The North Chemical New School District, located in Changping South Gate Town, occupies 1,800 acres and is 40 km from the city centre, is one of Beijing's key projects in the evacuation of non-capital functions.
The new campus will be built in three phases. The current phase has been completed and the second phase is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year. After completion, the project will meet the needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduates, graduate students and faculty staff for learning and living.
Looking back at this year's film market, we find that the original text of the film and the two crowds of stars are an important part of the film's expected audience.
At 17:10 today, the 119 Command Centre of Shaoyang City received an alarm that four hydrofurans stored at the Hongzhi Chemical Plant in Long Shutang, Zhuang Qing District, Shaoyang City, were caught in a fire.
The Shaoyang City Fire Department immediately dispatched five battalions of 20 fire trucks carrying heavy equipment such as anti-corrosion clothing and anti-corrosion washers to the scene.

Michelle Carter is sentenced to suicide for encouraging Conrad Roy by text messaging.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will serve 15 months of imprisonment, which can be converted to a reprieve after that period, with a further reprieve of 5 years.
Carter was convicted in June of a premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at Thursday's hearing, "My family is desperate.
My son is my best friend.
While waiting for the appeal, Carter was allowed to remain free.
She faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe that she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
At the time of the verdict, Carter stood, dressed in red trousers and a brown shirt, his hands clenched, tears in his eyes, his eyes down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make a better life for herself.
She doesn't take responsibility," the prosecutor said.
"She has no regrets.
But Carter's lawyers said it was "a terrible consequence and she felt very sorry."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behaviour."
One prosecutor, reading a statement by Lynn Roy, Roy's mother, said, "I haven't had a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I hope he'll be proud of what I've done and I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all my suffering, which will be with us forever," the statement said.
Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "spiritually depressed" to realize that she would never be able to attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
"It is a pain to lose someone who has accompanied me since I was born, and my life will be filled with it," she said.
The case seemed to set a precedent because Massachusetts law did not stipulate that others should be instigated to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from car-borne carbon monoxide poisoning; this year, Carter was 17.
Carter's text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, and the case raised national concerns.
There are many ways to hang, jump, stab yourself, she said in a few text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on holiday with his family.
At the time before he committed suicide, she wrote, "You need to do this, Conrad, and all you have to do is turn on the generator, and then you will have freedom and happiness."
Judge Moniz said Cat drew attention to Mr. Roy's death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal differences in this case.
Among the few defendants for Carter, Amanda Knox, accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
In a column published in the Los Angeles Times, Ms. Knox, 30, said Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment.

Auto makers face a shock, with Audi replacing up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi announced the modification, BMW said it would provide software upgrades for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW believes that "driving has more intelligent choices than restrictions", which means that major European cities - including its headquarters in Munich - are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles, said BMW chairman David Matsumoto.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would replace 300,000 Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed to have been recalled.
European car manufacturers are vigorously promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help achieve CO2 emissions targets.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are believed to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
The cost of automotive companies installing equipment to offset diesel exhaust emissions is also rising, making it difficult to keep diesels competitive in price.
As German automakers face scrutiny, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel has also been accused of over-releasing these powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.
These car companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular mistake of covering up their use of so-called failure devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations during car testing and returning to normal under normal driving conditions.
Several public officials have been charged in the United States, while others are under investigation in countries across the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermal mechanics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacchero Giovanni Palmio, who is Italian, is not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Oddy was involved in a criminal investigation in Germany involving the public, with the German government accusing Oddy of installing the system to evade European emissions requirements, which had previously been confined to the US.
Audi's investigation could have a major impact on the public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits.

Big Fish Haitang tells a magical story that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of the scheduled preview, it also brings a new expectation for all the audience.
"I've only done this thing for 12 years, and now it's turned from a dream into a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited," Liang said.
"I've always been obsessed with using one fifty-fifth of everybody's budget to create the exact same visual effect as everybody else," said Zhang Chun.
Dongguan, the "world factory" that used to rely on raw materials processing and large-scale production, is turning its attention to the high-level talents who can lead the city to reposition.
The city of Dongguan recently held a high-level talent event on Sunday, the first financial reporter saw some powerful local enterprises participate in talent talks.
The orange-red background walls are illuminated with bright billboards, each of which is marked with a price tag.
Accordingly, the China Television Production Industry Association decided to join the national television production industry and sign an autonomous convention.
Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is under threat from climate change.
Due to persistent drought and the emergence of virus-carrying insects, lavender is declining, causing headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agriculture institute in Provence (CRIEPPAM), said: "The lavender plant in Provence is facing enormous threats because it has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant reduction in spring rainfall and a slight drop in fall rainfall.
This will affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a smaller individual, a leaf cicada, which can spread micro-bacteria, and in very dry weather, they appear in abundance."
The key is its enormous quantity.
In addition to attracting vacationers, the elegant lavender fields are also popular in perfumery and cosmetics industries.
"In contrast to plants that can grow many large flowers and have very long ears, we have problems with smaller individuals, poorly developed, missing or weak," said Eric Chase.
So our essential oil content is less.
Solutions that are being studied include better irrigation techniques and techniques to slow the evaporation of soil moisture, protective mixtures of clay and water sprayed on plants, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction elements in the film, the two stars have said that what attracts them more are the stories in the film.
On the afternoon of September 5, reporters in the Wall Street Journal interviewed several prominent figures in the field of acoustics and two acoustical performers, surprisingly, they remained almost unanimous.
One of them was the Berlin Cinematographer, the other was an up-and-coming young actor, and Psychocrime was also Liao van's and Lee Feng's first partner.
Mexico is in serious danger, journalists are killed
The entire staff of the Riodose weekly usually meets on Wednesdays to review their plans to report on the disturbances in Sinaloa, which are caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and the endless drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy surrounds them, and they gather to discuss security issues.
They are told that it is important to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which is safer: whether to take their children to the office (the office was attacked by grenades in 2009) or leave them at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral and ally.
They gave these journalists the following names in each column--no evidence, no observation, no intuition enough.
With suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government's list, or Carter, the gang is putting Mexico's reporting at serious risk.
Violence continues, and more and more journalists are dying across the country: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection after being attacked and threatened; and at least 7 journalists have died in seven states so far this year.
The last to die was their editor and inspirational source, as well as the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdiz Cadenas.
Waldiz wrote many books about drug violence, one of which he wrote, "The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist.
Everyone could feel deeply that he had left, though he was everywhere--a huge photo hanging in front of the Riodece offices, Waldiz with his fingers up and the word "justice"; the T-shirts worn by the journalists Alan Ivara and Miriam Ramirez, over 30, also showed his smile, wearing glasses or his iconic Panamanian grass cap.
The seminar was held less than two months after his death; reporters discussed their common traumas, nightmares, insomnia, and multiple sclerosis.
Although a special Office of the Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with journalist cases, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, the Office prosecuted only two people.
Many of the thousands of crime cases per year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rare to bring the murderers of journalists to justice.
In "Riodoce," they insisted on reporting the violence in Sinaloa, even though they had broken their hearts, even though the land had been torn apart.
If there is no information about the murderer, if there is no extension of justice, then it is not much use to hold a security conference, Ivara said.
"It's stupid to waste time at a seminar like this," he said.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
His red Toyota Carola drove out of only a few blocks and was stopped by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name, translated as "The Twelve Ways".
The gangster drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two older children.
There are four rows of rows.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was captured last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become the country's bloodiest battleground, with all the enemy forces fighting madly.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot every day, and the cemetery is filled with two layers of gorgeous tombs of drug dealers, which have become commonplace.
The state of "peace" was temporarily forgotten when only one cartel controlled the coastal state and its ports and drug routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Waldiz knew the dangers of the job well, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Bohoque, was still guilty of not protecting his friends.
He believed that two mistakes caused the tragedy.
The first, published in February, was an interview with Damascus Lopez, who led a cartel that fought with several of Guzman's sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspapers were bought off by suspected gang members as soon as they were sent to the newsstand.
The second mistake was that another newspaper covering the same story was arrested without forcing Waldiz to consider leaving Mexico for his own safety.
Valdez is a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death has significant implications for the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit survived, and his friends and colleagues believed that he was always with us.
In 2003, he was a senior journalist for Northeast, where he co-founded Riodoce with five colleagues and sold a $50 stake.
In Sinaloa, "It is impossible for a journalist not to deal with the drug problem," said Bohoque.
As time passed, the newspaper gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish directly harmful investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers also like newspapers to publish stories that others do not dare to report.
Riodoce won the Maria Moscabo News Award in Latin America five years after its inception.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded him the Valdiz International Prize for Freedom of the Press for his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug coverage.
He admitted that he was also afraid.
"I want to keep on living," he said when the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize.
Later, in late October, he said in an interview on local television Rompeviento TV that "in Sinaloa, drug trafficking is a way of life,
You have to take on the tasks that fall on your shoulders as a journalist - either that way or pretending to be deaf and dumb.
I don't want to be asked, 'What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you speak out about what was happening?
All of Riodoce's staff remembered Waldiz, remembered him screaming like a dock worker, remembered this friend who never gave up on embracing and recommending, remembered this teacher who knew how to live.
They rely on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar in front of the office always sits at the same table.
Now, they will ask: Did his daily habits cause his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live well.
"They don't like you causing trouble to their women and children, and they don't like you affecting their legitimate companies and secret airports for the transportation of drugs," he said.
These things are beyond their limits.
As a result, even at the safest time, a high level of self-examination and self-protection must be maintained.
Believe in your intuition.
If you smell the dangerous smell, get away.
The problem is that "the breath is a feeling of being deceived . . . and then something like Harvey will happen," says Andrews Villar, editor of Riodoce.
He and others said that the old rules no longer applied to Sinaloa--as they did to Tamaulipas, Vera Cruz, Guerrero, and other states where the smuggling routes were profitable, where the institutions were weak, where government officials were corrupt, and where the smoke was thin.
The situation is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly banned in rooms where Riodoce employees attended security training; a few days ago, reportedly only government spy software was sold in Mexico for surveillance of journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took a cool ride under the shade of trees to avoid 104 degrees (40 Celsius) high temperatures.
They were sent by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in the middle-class district of Curiacan.
Some reporters half-joked that they didn't know if the policemen were just 50 percent of what the governor himself said.
Journalists have been in the mountains for months now, where the drug gangs are under actual control.
This week's "Riodoce" covers three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of the great former Cincinnati boxer Julio Cesar Chavez,
And the governor's hometown's disclosure of government funds,
As well as the kidnapping of a costly restaurant in Curiacan, which is only a block away from the prosecutor's office.
Officials didn't release information about the kidnappers and the kidnapping process, so it's important to be careful about what the city knows: that this restaurant is the place where drug dealers and officials love to go.
A public archive reported that the restaurant was registered with the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), a political party that dominated every political class almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several revolutionary party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-profile cases.
Villar asked reporters to write down beforehand what had happened at the scene, including the incident in which a son of Mexico's top drug dealer, Guzmán, escaped a military attack.
If a few months ago, readers would have looked at Waldiz's columns to find the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
"We knew what had happened before," he said, 46-year-old Valerie, who is nicknamed "slender" because of her thin body.
Now all our communication channels from information sources are blocked.
Waldiz's offices are now used to store signs and posters protesting the killing of journalists, because employees have become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign out of the room and went to the local prosecutor's office to participate in a demonstration related to another journalist.
Salvador Adamé disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after his murder in Valdez.
Officials found a burned body and claimed that it was his, according to DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists have become more open-minded, organizing protests and spraying the words "save the media" on pedestrians and buildings.
On that day, director Bohoque was not in Washington, D.C., and he was working to spread justice in the Waldiz case and secure international support.
The next day, at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused officials of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also requested that she resign her position in government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “surrounded” by organized crime, corrupt government officials, and apathy from society.
In his last book, The Drug News Industry, he wrote that journalists were not only harassed by drug gangs, but also on the list of politicians and security forces associated with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of the attacks last year.
In Mexico, they kill you to keep your mouth shut, said Ramirez.
Obviously, these murders are frightening.
No one forgets that six years ago the goddess Maria Elizabeth Messias died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was accompanied by a sign, allegedly signed by Zetas Carter: "I came for my report.
Her head was cut off, alongside a computer keyboard and an earphone.
Some newspapers, such as El Norte, on the northern border of Chihuahua, have chosen to close after Milosevic was killed in March.
Others continued, including the director of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo, who was killed in 2014, but they continued.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a first edition of an open-ended drug dialogue cartel entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some reporters have fled their homeland, or even the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still have to be careful on the streets, to be careful of danger.
Sometimes they are arrested, and it is said that in 2015, photographer Ruben Espinoza was killed in a Mexican city with four women three months after fleeing Vera Cruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is the daily dance of high-risk decisions.
Ivara had wanted to become a poet, and he admitted that reporting on drug trafficking made him afraid.
"Mexico is turning into hell," he said, "so I became a journalist."
At midnight last Friday, the latest issue of the newspaper had already been printed, and the editors of "Riodoce" were sitting on the street outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their cell phones rang.
A series of shootings involving rival gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Massachusetts have confirmed 19 deaths.
The battle is still escalating, as predicted by a series of cartel information discovered in the area.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website on the side of the road via mobile phone.
The following day the headline had to be changed.
The whistles were ringing nearby - another deadly gunfight was taking place in the area.
Pollocky glanced at the policemen who stood there guarding, to see if they had awakened.
If they have a little fear, they don't show up either.
The newspaper's founders had died, and in his large portrait he pointed to the sights of the whole of Sinaloa, with the entire staff of Riodoce following his footsteps.
"How can you even want to shut it down? The day Harvey was killed, interns asked me to send her to the streets to participate in the reporting," said Pohoque.
China's self-driving tourism market will grow to more than 10 billion yuan in 2020
In the context of increased consumption and free travel, self-driving has been encouraged by national policies and popularized by more and more consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving market, which is expected to surpass one trillion, faces double challenges.
Against the background of increased consumption and free travel, self-driving has been encouraged by national policies and popularized by more and more consumers.
At the same time, however, the self-driving market, which is expected to surpass one trillion, faces two challenges: on the one hand, the development of the self-driving industry is incompatible with market demand, self-driving clubs and self-driving organizations such as travel agencies are facing the plight of small profits, and on the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing self-driving are still in the initial stages.
60 per cent of the country's tourists, the market is expected to be worth billions
In 2016, self-driving accounted for about 60 percent of the total number of tourists in the country, and the market is expected to exceed one billion by 2020.
According to the statistics on the number of self-driving tourists, the number of self-driving tourists has grown steadily over the last five years, and the proportion of self-driving tourists in China is stable at more than half.
At the same time, the regions and the national level have shown more attention and support for self-driving in this emerging area, and from 2016 to 2017, policies and regulations related to self-driving, traveling cars and camping tourism have been introduced intensively.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Bureau and the National General Administration of Sport, jointly issued the "Plan for the Development of Motor Driving Sports Camps"; in the same month, 14 departments, including the Commission for Development Policy and the Ministry of Finance, jointly issued the "Programme of Action to Promote the Promotion and Upgrading of Rural Tourism Development (2017)", in which motor driving was highlighted.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of self-driving in the country.
Self-driving club profit is small, complete chain chain is key
Although the domestic self-driving market has great potential and national policies have been positively guided, the self-driving industry is still at an early stage.
According to the 2016-2017 China Self-driving Annual Development Report, there are thousands of self-driving clubs, car clubs, car-lovers, etc. in China, but the majority of tourists self-organize self-driving trips, and only about 15% of tourists participate in various organizations such as car-lovers, self-driving clubs, etc.
At the same time, self-developed self-driving products on-line tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies are also among the leading, many on-line tourism platforms sold only some suppliers provided self-driving products, some self-driving clubs are also important suppliers.
From the point of view of organizing self-driving activities, it covers many aspects of "eating, living, walking, traveling, buying, enjoying," with a high degree of fragmentation, a high supply chain, and a high degree of randomness in the consumption of tourists.
The founder and CEO of the Beijing Travellers' Motor Club, Li Cung-jee, believes that the self-driving club is essentially similar to travel agencies, and that the primary profit model in the early days was a bottom-up activity, the core point being the self-driving line products and team services.
Today, however, the quality of the line products within the self-driving sector is severely homogenized, and the level of command service is uneven, and the self-driving club faces the need for a re-transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving itself is not an independent industry, but by its self-driving migration characteristics forms a cross-regional, industry ecosphere, forming a complete chain of industry is very important.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of self-driving industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, the "self-driving +" theme and the IP of self-driving products should be developed.
The scenic paths are not just roads, the motor camps should not only satisfy the accommodation
Faced with the rise of self-driving, the basic supporting development of self-driving is also relatively primitive.
Mr. Li points out that tourist scenic routes are not just a road, but need to integrate the elements of transportation and tourism. However, the repair of roads and tourism itself is the responsibility of two departments. The transportation department adds tourism elements and also stops building toilets, advice centers, promotional columns, etc., and the integration of tourism is not high.
Compared with the well-known self-driving route "U.S. 66 highway", the construction experience is worthy of reference.
The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and quick route between the starting point and the destination, but according to the concept of "experienced driving pleasure" design, to provide the best enjoyment of the scenic scenery along the road for self-driving tourists; scenic routes can connect the point-shaped and face-shaped tourist landscapes, both preserving the historical value and cultural value of ecological tourism resources along the way, as well as organizing all kinds of thematic activities to enhance the participation of tourists and leisure experience, creating economic benefits for local tourism industry.
Besides the scenic path, the campsite is also an important accompanying facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists known by the New York Times correspondent, few consumers choose to stay at the campsite.
They believe that many camps are oriented towards infrastructure, which can only satisfy the need for food, low-grade, single-product, and self-driving, which includes many elements.
Those who do not want to reveal their names say that many of the companies that have been operating in the past few years have been doing so because they want to take the land, and after taking the land, the latter's supportive infrastructure construction and services have not followed up, and the operating conditions are many losses, and without the latter's injection of funds, it is difficult to make some of the corresponding supportive products.
Consumer groups
According to data released in 2017 by the China Travel Ship and Craft Association, the age group of self-drivers is concentrated in the 21-40 age group, especially the 31-40 age group, which has a certain economic base and a higher demand for personalized tourism, and is mostly a parent-driver group.
From the accommodation survey, self-driving people prefer non-standard accommodation relatively more.
From the type of self-driving, peripheral self-driving is the main type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32 per cent.
Self-driving is a desire of many people, but a smaller proportion.
At the same time, with the rise in consumer demand, tourists who used to like to drive "touring attractions" began to change their minds, no longer to "get off the car, take a picture, get on the car and sleep" in the process of driving, but to focus more on the travel experience and process.
The dinosaurs hide from their enemies in their underwear
At first sight, it was terrifying, but it looked like a statue.
The researchers released the first results of a Canadian miner's discovery of remarkable biological fossils the size of a rhino, indicating that they are well preserved and thus known by experts as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur World".
The fossil is very well preserved, and even the color of its slender skin can be determined to be red-brown, indicating that it has had some "troubleful experiences".
A related report in the journal Contemporary Biology described it as "one of the best preserved pygmy dinosaurs ever discovered and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of tetanus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous between 1.1 and 1.2 billion years ago.
Its state of preservation was extremely good, and the researchers were shocked, describing it as "really stunning".
According to the National Geographic Magazine, the grass-eating Piper dinosaur fossil is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shaw Funk discovered the fossil at the Senkor Millennium Mine near McMurrayburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At that time, he encountered something that did not seem to resemble the surrounding rocks, so he decided to look carefully.
Afterwards, the fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Australian Museum of Archaeology.
It took the researchers six years to bring the animal to light, hidden inside 2500 pounds (1,100 kg) of soil.
After such hard work, the final results have now been published.
"If you look at it closely, you almost believe it's asleep," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Tyre Museum, where the creature is on display
"It will be one of the most beautiful dinosaur specimens in the history of science, one of the best preserved dinosaur specimens in the world - Mona Lisa.
The researchers, by studying its skin, found that although the grass-eating creature is armed like a walking tank, it is likely to be seriously threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
This type of heavy-arm dinosaur uses red-and-white masks to hide from predators, and uses a technique known as "anti-shadowing", which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say this way it can better integrate with its surroundings and thus avoid enemies, indicating that it is being eaten by larger dinosaurs.
The 1.1-billion-year-old creature, a member of the Taurus family, made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrill Museum of Antiquities.
After a 7,000-hour effort by one of the team's museum technicians, Mark Mitchell, to uncover the giant's veil, the researchers are now studying it and naming it "Borealopelta markmitchelli".
The samples were preserved to a great extent, enabling Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of scales and armor on his body.
They discovered "anti-shadow" techniques, a common form of defense in the animal kingdom, which meant that the species' back was darker than its side.
Despite the widespread use of "anti-shadow" techniques, the findings were surprising, as the dinosaur's body was much larger than that of existing animals that used anti-shadow techniques.
These dinosaurs face the pressure of being hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs, thus evolving in a favourable direction, enabling them to hide in barriers as a means of survival.
However, the majority of existing anti-shadow animals, such as deer, zebras, or tigers, are as small and vulnerable as hunters, indicating that the creature is under real survival pressure.
"The extinction of large heavy metal dinosaurs shows how dangerous the meat dinosaurs of Cretaceous were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also showed that the dinosaur's skin color was red-brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the clues to the creature's life, including the stomach contents it retains, to find the final food it eats.
They believed that dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death, then were plunged into the sea, and finally sinked backwards into the sea floor.
At that time, the climate in Alberta was as warm as it is today in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans may have been deeper inland than they are today.
"This is truly astonishing," Brown said, "because it is completely covered by the skin of the scales it has been preserved, and it has been preserved in dimensional space so that its original shape can be preserved."
"Therefore, the present form of this species is almost identical to that of Cretaceous.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you almost believe it's asleep.
The Cretaceous period was the period when two-legged giant animal-footed dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Despite being the king of the dinosaurs, it did not appear until millions of years after the Piraeus. The Piraeus may have been captured by some of its ancestors.
They include the tall spiny dragon, a giant that weighs up to 6 tons and is 38 feet (11.5 m) long.
Scientists in the magazine Contemporary Biology believed that the lizard was pushed into the sea after it died and then formed a mummy in the mud, the latest study found.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink unearthed the creature at the Millennium Mine near McMurrayburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved bat dinosaur, complete with skin and armor from the nose to the hips.
The average length of this species is about 18 feet (5 m) and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It has two 20-inch-long spikes rising from the shoulder.
The researchers believed that the grass-eating pygmy dinosaurs were active in present-day western Canada and then flooded into the sea by flooding streams.
However, these dinosaurs buried at the bottom of the sea allow their jackets to be preserved intact.
The fossil remains of this special specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin are still covered with concave, uneven pores on the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, this level of conservation is as rare as medium color.
The more I see it, the more incredible it feels.
The remains of skin fossils are still covered with a patched helmet on the dinosaur's skull.
Its right forehand is on its side and five toes extend upwards.
I can count it out on the first sheet.
The journalists learned that adding natural or plant sources of seaweed acid, rotted vegetable acid and amino acid additive carriers to the urea production process can modify the effect of traditional urea, and the utilization rate of seaweed acid urea, zinc rotted urea, and wheat-grain urea nitrogen increased by 5 to 10 percentage points compared to normal urea.
Environmentally friendly, the potential of crop increase production is obvious, especially large-scale added urea is the quality raw material of BB fertilizer.
The total number of security personnel will be more than double the number of security personnel for the 2012 London Olympics.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will launch its largest ever joint security operation.
Previously, the Brazilian Government had indicated that a total of 8.5 million soldiers and police officers would join forces, including 20,000 soldiers and 6.5 million police officers.
Most of the soldiers will be in charge of protecting the Olympic stadium, while an additional 3,000 soldiers will be in charge of security at international airports, subway stations and streets.
Police patrol other parts of the city, including the subway, bus and streets.
It is reported that about 6,000 soldiers have already arrived at the Olympic security service.
They are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic stadium, in addition to the four competition areas for the Rio Olympics.
The introduction of evaluation mechanism in the service industry is not new. In order to make the evaluation mechanism work effectively, it is important to make the regulation more effective and not streamlined.
How do radicals learn to answer the question "Whose street is it?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrer was in a state of panic.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat in his rented bed and surfed the social networking site on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post from a high school student.
It reads, "The police just killed an 18-year-old child and the child is lying on the street."
She was confused when she found that nobody else had posted the message on the feed. She shut down her Facebook page and opened Twitter.
A @TheePharoah user constantly sends her a dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man unarmed, was shot dead by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He pasted a picture of Brown lying on the street with his body laid on the street for four hours.
"I'm crazy," Feller thought.
But for her and her community, death isn't something new.
She laid down her cell phone until the evening when she re-opened her Twitter account and read about the crowds gathered on Campbell's Avenue.
There were police footage and people shouting, and a photograph of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, which read, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a message delivered on the spot when a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"It's not what we're used to and can be called a typical murder.
At that moment, I felt cold and cheerful.
I'm angry. I'm crying.
She scheduled a return flight and came home the next day.
After landing at 11 o'clock in the afternoon, she took her six-year-old daughter away from her father's house and decided that the two would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
For the next three years, what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson was the subject of a new documentary film, Who's Street, which premiered on August 11 in the theater.
It's a story about living and protesting, love and losing, strength and resilience, from the perspective of people who live in this community, crowded with streets and alleys asking for answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter (who was dressed in a flower dress and wearing a crown) drove to Ferguson, the two re-discussed the subjects they had discussed countless times before that morning--"about the black experience and the situation of black people."
"Do you remember when I taught you that black people had to fight for their faith," she recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because it's wrong the police killed an 18-year-old boy.
I have to take her with me," said Ferrell afterwards.
"What is happening today is the culmination of everything that happened in the past.
She knew, saw, and rose out of it.
She needs not only to develop well in terms of radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation, and to understand what we must do in order to achieve freedom and liberation.
Even though I was fortunate enough to provide her with an experience of racism she had never experienced in her own life, she was no different from other black girls.
If I'm protecting her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her.
They arrived at Ferguson's first station at a site opposite the South Florida Road Police Station, which became their camp when the militants waited for the final outcome of policeman Darren Wilson's non-prosecution.
Ferrell and her daughter contacted a local business owner who made lunch bags.
They prepared the bags and were responsible for passing them to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new kind of activism.
"My radicalism changed radically after August 9th," she said.She was chairman of the Minority Nurses' Association at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, where she studied undergraduate degrees, focusing on the food justice and health disparities in the black community.
"I don't have any organizational experience.
That's how it all came about.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the film's co-director, Sabakh Faryan, during an evening parade.
She said she and her film director Lucas Alvarado Farrell "just wanted to record" what had happened.
Farrell had a question in his mind: "Do you want to record or do you want to find a story that you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases: people - usually white people - enter a community to benefit from its pain and hardship.
As Fleming explained in a recent interview, "We've heard that people who are indigenous to Ferguson don't concentrate their voices, and we want to do it differently.
Flayan has been in touch with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell and six other locals to join the Who's Street project team, which remained in place for several years after Brown was shot.
"This documentary is not about someone talking to us or talking to us, it's about us," Davis said.
"I'm mainly interested in how these characters are presented, because that's how I'm presented.
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences – but to show that the campaign was “not about saving the world’s leaders, but about community cohesion,” said Farrell – the facts prove that she is the most open of film participants.
As a result, "Who's Street?" surprisingly records Ferrell's personal life, such as falling in love, getting married.
"I feel naked," Ferrell laughed when he saw the finished product for the first time.
But I understand that to do this job and humanize black people must have some degree of vulnerability.
Furthermore, Ferrell's story reaffirms and redefines the role of black cool women in a broader movement of black life events.
Two of the three founders of the movement – #BlackLivesMatter created on social media after the 2012 shooting of a black teenager, Trevor Martin – are considered cool.
淚t is because we are fighting on many fronts,?said Farrell.
Black cowardly women must endure all this.
Fleming agreed and noted that "the movement really has the support of black women and many black cool girls."
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen as the centerpiece of the film, however, she insisted, "It's not a positive action for things."
"She's the one who has this energy," she said.
"While she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence, because in life at these crossroads, you have a lot of things to do as a black cool woman.
You can feel her energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police still exist.
Farrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years' imprisonment for attempting to block the highway during a demonstration.
She describes the social and political atmosphere in what she calls her home area as "a mess."
Nevertheless, since she walked up Ferguson Street three years ago, she has been sticking to the sacred song that she has tried to keep in mind.
"We have a responsibility to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except the fetters on our bodies.
Indeed, online translation services were already available on the Internet a decade ago, and the argument that “machines are about to replace humans in translation” was heard much earlier.
Similarities: Artists use the DNA of Chelsea Manning to create portraits
There are many faces in the center of the Friedrichmann Gallery in New York City: white, black, and brown, each with almost intangible similarities, bound by lines hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist, Dewey-Hagborg, using Chelsea Manning's cheek patches and hair scraps.
Manning sent scraps of hair from the prison in Livorno, where the intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking secret diplomatic cables via WikiLeaks.
The exhibition opened on 2 August with the title "The Similarities".
This was the result of two years of communication between Duvy Haggard and Manning, who combined her discipline with her own in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a prominent dissident who had been jailed and had undergone a transgenic surgery in jail. Former US President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before her term ended.
Through algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA, he created 30 portraits of "probably appearing appearances," with a sharp and slightly ruthless comment both on the ambiguity of DNA and on the concept of identity itself.
Born Bradley Edward, Manning publicly admitted to believing in himself as a woman in adolescence, and was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six cases of espionage law violations, computer fraud, and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a grainy black-and-white self-portrait, looking clearly anxious, sitting on the driver's seat, wearing platinum-golden hair.
In 2015, Heather Duvy Haeborg achieved great success in her 2012 project Strange Visions.
In that work, she uses court documents such as cigarettes and candy, DNA extracted from scraps, and creates 3D portraits of people that may be similar in length.
That was when she received an e-mail from Paper magazine.
"They want to interview Chelsea Manning in jail, and they need a portrait," Heather Duvy Haboge told the media at the opening ceremony.
Chelsea Manning was unable to visit or take photographs at the time, so they contacted Chelsea to ask her if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
Thus, the artist and her imprisoned Muse became unlikely literary friends and exchanged many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book titled The Depressed Head, drawn by Shoili Kanungo, which anticipates that the president will be able to grant a privilege to Manning to see exhibitions in jail.
It may have been a coincidence that Manning had just spent the first seven years in Kansas Military Prison.
Moreover, there is another layer of profoundness in the exhibition, because in the contemporary United States, the Trump administration is constantly campaigning against government leaks and transgender soldiers, while seeking new ways to inflame divisions, which can be speculated about on Twitter, and it is the exhibition that is trying to bridge that division.
When asked about these special occasions, Heather Duvy Haeborg said, "Everything happens for a reason."
In an artist's statement on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature below (the "i" in the name is drawn with a heart) calls for an end to the "dispute between parties based on gender, sexual orientation, and culture."
On the opposite wall is the sequence of her mitochondrial DNA, with the Cs, Gs, and As symbols written in pencil twists.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleotides, a complicated scientific dictionary for each artist), Heather Duvy Hubbard wanted to express, at least physiologically, that everyone is like this by depicting these strangely similar portraits.
"I hope people get out of this dilemma, our genomes don't care who we are, how open genetic data is interpreted, how subjective it is," said Heather Duvy Hubbard, whose 2007 video, False Memory, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell us many different stories, so these are 30 of them.
The last piece in the exhibition, in a room, comes from a page of the novel in the previous illustration.
The manning is a gold-plated figure floating under an amplifier in the hands of American soldiers.
"They won when they stopped your speech," wrote on the wall.
So don't shut up.
"It comes directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm just scared. I still have to say it.
Manning hadn't seen the exhibition herself, as she predicted in the cartoons, but when she did, she would be cheered by her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters at the exhibition center.
It was also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of her pencil-written genetic duplicate information (5.2 feet, Manning’s height).
"In the past, I hung them on the walls, but I hoped they felt like a group," said Duvy Hagberg when talking about the portraits.
"But I want them to feel like a group of protesters with Chelsea, just like people protested at the time for her release.
Professors of Northwestern University and Oxford University Staff Sued for Murder
Police said a man was found to have been stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a professor at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University were subsequently pursued and are currently searching for suspects nationwide.
On Monday, 42-year-old Wendem Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were arrested for the murder of Trenton H. James Connell Duranlo on suspicion of manslaughter, according to court records in Cook County.
According to documents, 26-year-old Connell Duranloin died of multiple stab wounds.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on 27 July.
The police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the phone call and found several cracks in the victims.
The police said that Connell Duranlo had died on the scene, and that the detective was investigating his murder, while the police were actively searching for two suspects.
He has been Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, Allen K. Cobbach, deputy head of campus relations, said that Lesem had now been fired and had been banned from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"It is now a criminal case, and the authorities are investigating it, and Northwestern University is actively cooperating with the investigation," Coveridge said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University of Oxford's Summerville College said in an e-mail statement, "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the U.S. investigation as required.
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he would be able to take the case on his own.
The chief liaison officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Colemi, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have a rough idea of where they are coming from, and we're trying to locate possible locations," he said.
He said local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search for suspects.
The police have received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who has just received a secret tip that apartment 1008 was in trouble, he said.
The police said the situation was terrifying.
It is still unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July, he said.
He said the security cameras confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
"We believe that Professor Lessem has something to do with the victims," he said.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to residents: "Police are currently studying the victims' timeline and background, investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the roadmap for the world's anti-doping agencies in the near future," Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to restore the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"The implementation of the roadmap standards has reached a certain stage and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," Motco said on Thursday.
The statement was made by Deputy Prime Minister Motoc in his comments on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency Roadmap, Compliance, which sets out the standards for the restoration of the rights of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the standard does not include anything that might cause Russia concerns.
He added, "Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future."
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency must openly accept the findings of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard Michaelon into the use of doping in sports in Russia, which was approved by WADA.
Speaking about this, Motco said, "We are investigating and there is no doubt that our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there's no national plan behind it, and we won't admit that there isn't.
Motko's remarks were in response to Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the past of the Russian anti-doping agency earlier in the day when he was interviewed by the Russian outlet RSport, but added, "We have said many times on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally," said Smirnov.
Following the doping scandal in November 2015, WADA suspended RUSADA's right to conduct doping inspections in Russia.
But in June, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Nagrie, who visited the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, said that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" and was working to restore its rights.

There's no need to buy a replacement anymore! These 8,000 products have zero tariffs
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that there are 15 FTAs in force in China, covering 23 countries and regions, and covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic fish, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits from ASEAN ... all of these products you want can be purchased at no extra cost.
At present, our country has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and territories, 15 of which have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
For example, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers can taste good quality and cheap agricultural products from different regions all year round.
For example, tropical fruits such as pineapples, lakhs, and mangroves in ASEAN have been reduced from 15 to 30 per cent of their import tariffs to zero.
Icelandic import tariffs on fish are reduced from 10% to 12% to zero tariffs;
Red wine from Georgia and Chile, import tariffs reduced from 14% to 30% to zero tariffs;
New Zealand's specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder have also had substantial tax reductions.
For industrial goods, for example, some cosmetics import tariffs in Switzerland have been reduced to zero;
Import duties on some watches have been reduced by 50% and will be reduced to zero duties in a few years;
South Korea's import tariffs on electric refrigerators, cookers, massagers, cosmetics, etc. have been reduced by 40 percent and will be reduced to zero tariffs in a few years.
There are also substantial tax cuts for consumer electronics.
At the same time, zero-tariff products under the FTA also include many intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic end-of-life consumer goods, and to some extent promote the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, nearly one-third of China's total imports are subject to preferential tariffs under the FTA, most of which are end-of-life consumer goods, which brings real benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import duties on consumer goods
As of December 1, 2017, China has adjusted import tariffs on some consumer goods, further reducing import tariffs on consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods such as food, health care products, medicines, sunscreen supplies, clothing and footwear caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and daily grocery stores.
The average tax rate on these consumer goods will be reduced from 17.3% to 7.7%, almost being cut off!
As of January 1, 2018, China has also made some adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on some cosmetics such as lip balms, eye shadows and perfumes are reduced from 10% to 5%;
Lower tariffs mean that consumers don't have to buy for themselves and don't have to travel far abroad to buy their favorite foreign products.
2018 Yiwu Import Goods Shopping Festival: Import red wine, snacks, fruit ... all at a cheaper price!
Exhibit: U.S. malls at the end of the year have big differences in terms of shopping returns
Sunday, December 29
According to the United States' World Daily, Christmas has just passed and there has been a backlog of goods.
About half of the goods sold for Christmas last year were returned, according to ABC.
Additionally, there are readers who have been deceived by repeatedly bombing online purchases, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on unregulated websites.
In general, large shopping companies have regular and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or shopping from some small shops, you have to be careful.
A woman in Logan bought a coat at an online shop specializing in printing coat on December 1 at local time for more than $60 and hasn't sent it yet.
She sent an e-mail to the customer service and didn't get a reply.
Another netizen, who traveled to the United States last year, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller and sent it back, found that it contained a box of rubber mud.
Knowing that you have been deceived, apply for a refund to the website and receive the full refund.
But there are also customers who think that the site's refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in northern California, said he had twice purchased a quick delivery service from a website, one for $4, but hadn't delivered it on time twice.
Thereafter, he applied for repayment and received no reply.
Large malls or shopping malls have better return policy.
Most of Macy's goods are refunded in full within 180 days.
However, the goods must be kept "as they were" and must have a purchase certificate such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there is no voucher, customers can also get shopping points, which can be used to buy other products.
Target usually has a 90-day return period for general goods and 15 days for electronic goods.
However, the withdrawal period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between 1 November 2017 and 25 December 2017 is extended to 30 days.
Note that the 30-day withdrawal period starts on December 25th, i.e. before January 25th, 2018.
A new era of shopping development is coming
More than a decade ago, our country was still in the market of the seller in general, people have limited choice, and demand is also limited.
But after decades of development, the market has already achieved a shift from the seller's market to the buyer's market, and today consumer tastes have become harder, and they are no longer satisfied with simple-to-use "hand-to-hand-to-hand" shopping.
So, how to give consumers a great shopping experience is the next point of competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors that influence the consumer's shopping experience, shopping centers in the shopping districts have the most significant influence.
See how city builders everywhere pay attention to shopping experience.
There are no two exactly the same leaves in the world, nor are there two exactly the same shopping centers. A famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Canyon Shopping Centre in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design inspiration comes from the Grand Canyon, is named after the harmonic Kanyon, where walking along the 200-meter trail of the Minister in the Grand Canyon feels like being in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, there is also a large elliptical stage in the centre of the shopping center, which is unique in appearance and often hosts featured performances.
Because of the open platform design, visitors can walk on each floor and overlook the activities taking place in the canyon, and have the effect of shifting and changing views.
At home, the Nanjing Forest Mall, China's first forest-style shopping mall, combines shopping perfectly with ecology and fairy tales.
The project consists of nine single buildings, connected by aerial corridors between each of the buildings, designed as a whole underground courtyard, with French pine trees on the top of the grounds as the architectural surface, roof water platforms, creating a forest-like feeling.
Going into the forest, Moore, like falling accidentally into the rabbit hole in Alice's adventure book, the climbing trunks will surround the building, the grass and the fountain will reflect, bring people into the forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, Long Lake created Li Jiang Beach water district, planning hundreds of department stores, planning the future introduction of more than 50 international top-class exclusive flagship stores, more than 100 international top-class brands and more than 500 international and overseas famous brands, to become a service industry gathering, thematic distinctive business center.
Not only that, Lei Jia also integrates ecological architecture, guided by TOD public transport, brings together fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, and sports, while bringing consumers a great shopping experience and leading them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "riverside culture", merging shopping with water entertainment and leisure perfectly.
Overall, it can be found that at present, some housing companies are aware of the track of discovery of this new urban business, and the industry says that this consumer experience-centered consumption model of how to combine shopping with experience will be the mainstream of future city development.
Nowadays, shopping malls are not only a collection of goods, but also a combination of arts and culture, creative themes, and carry the responsibility of people to live in the city.
Therefore, while satisfying the consumer's one-stop material needs of eating, drinking, playing and shopping, it is necessary to maximize the spiritual needs of multi-layered cultural and artistic transfer, and to fulfill the residential needs, which will be the high point of the future development of shopping malls.
In Chongqing, China's northern shore of Jiangshan, located in the northern part of the Jiangsu River, close to Guanyin Bridge, boasts the world's finest business, international giants are crowded around, first-class brands are combined, and international fashion is closely linked.
Here is a step-by-step luxury, the essence of the world of aloe;
Dongyuan Jinet has a better shopping environment, Dongyuan Jinet is close to Nanping shopping district, enjoying the western and even the nation's leading four-storey 3D transportation system, increasing shopping comfort.
In addition, the garden greening and landscape landscaping of the two pedestrian streets of Huitong Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, about 300 trees have been planted, and 40,000 square meters of landscaping have been renovated, and the image of Nanping district has been enhanced;
Long Lake Yue Lake One, close to Chongqing's first low-density seaside shopping mall, Li Jiang Seaside Shopping Mall, is surrounded by nine parks, low-density commercial streets, and high degree of openness, making people more willing to stop, walk, and enjoy the pleasure of shopping, rather than being surrounded by the back of people hurriedly hurriedly ahead, really achieved "walking shopping."
Today's commercial competition is only getting more intense, how to kill a bloody path in the serious homogenization of the market, to take the "shopping sacred place" in the hearts of future consumers, worthy of all real estate developers to think seriously.
Differential strategies alone are far from enough, and only developers who really rightly put consumers in their hearts, who care about consumers, who care about consumers, who care about consumers, and who provide consumers with a great and concise shopping experience will be able to laugh in the storming market.
Of course, at the end I think the most happy is the children of Chongqing, who have such a good shopping experience and shopping malls, put 10 years ago no one can imagine today's prosperity.
Goods Festival: Consumerism's frenzy conceals true environmental prices
On November 11, 2017, a total of $16.82 billion was spent on the "Tian Cat Twin Eleven World Carnival Festival" during the 24 hours of the event.
Specifically, after the launch of the twin 11, in just three minutes, Tian Cat's turnover exceeded 10 billion dollars, 6 minutes 05 seconds exceeded 20 billion dollars, and 9 hours exceeded 10 billion dollars.
This day, global consumers made a total of 14.8 billion payments, up 41% from last year.
This consumption will result in 81.2 billion logistics orders.
And whether it's Tian Cat Net Purchase Platform or Payment宝 Payment Platform, all belongs to Ma Yun Ali Group.
A decade ago, no one would have imagined that November 11 would be the phenomenal "Double Eleven" shopping festival, where single youths would be gathered together in a subculture of "light sticks" created by self-mockery.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba made its first use of a marketing stunt called "The Big Christmas Promotion": Nobody talks to you about being in love, so "single dogs" come and buy online.
The result was surprising, the day Taobao Shopping Mall (the predecessor of "Tian Cat") trade amounted to more than 5200 million yuan, 10 times the daily trade amount at the time.
From the beginning, domestic buyers and sellers enjoyed themselves, and now the influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, the cats "双11" billion transactions have been more than 3200 times that year, making "Black Friday" dust-free.
In addition to the "Two Eleven" promotions, there are many retailers, among them the most powerful of which is the "Yin".
Qingdao has its own shopping festival "6.18", but the "double 11" does not have a big impact, this year from November 1 to November 11, Qingdao's cumulative sales reached 1271 billion yuan.
After the twin 11, the twin 12, similar to it, will be followed by the break-up of festivities and the Christmas New Year shopping season.
Passing the New Year, waiting for Chinese consumers and before the Spring Festival year-round shopping period, Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, will not have a holiday.
The environmental problems caused by instantaneous marine consumption have already attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to the Xinhua Daily Telegraph, at least 300,000 tons of rubbish was produced during the "Double 11" this year, according to the industry's usual standard maintenance estimate of 0.2 kg per packing box.
Liu Hua, director of the pollution prevention and control project at the Green Peace East Asia Branch, told the China-China Dialogue that this year, the order quantity of twin 11 cats alone will generate 1.6 million tons of packaging garbage.
In 2016, the National Postal Service (NPS) published a report stating that in the period between 11 November 2015 and 16 November 2015, about 7,800 million fast-track items were used, with more than 3 billion weaving bags, 99.2 million packaging boxes, and 169.85 billion meters of tape, tape lengths that can circumnavigate 425 orbits of the Earth's equator.
This year, the National Postal Service expects the "Double 11" to handle more than 1.5 billion fast-track items.
Wang Xi, manager of a garbage incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua news agency that the daily quantity of garbage entered after the twin 11 was more than 2,000 tons and exceeded the capacity of the incineration plant to handle it.
Express companies have realized that environmental pollution caused by the express industry is inescapable.
Some retail logistics companies, including Sunning, have introduced recyclable reusable plastic delivery boxes, recycled packing bags that can be used as shopping bags and garbage bags, but consumers who are uncomfortable are not very receptive.
Ma Yun also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics" in microblogging.
The video received over 68,000 "applause".
What kind of mobile payments do Germans want?
Zhang Winter: The mobile payment battle that has opened up in Germany is unlikely.
WeChat payments and paypals have moved the battlefield to Europe, but the competition hasn't changed, and the battlefield hasn't changed. Chinese, too, is globalized?
Where there is a place to pay for treasure, there must be a Weibo payment.
According to an agreement with the German electronic payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Payment officially landed in Germany in November this year and is gradually being deployed to businesses throughout Europe.
This strange encounter between the two "old towns" happened again in Europe.
For a long time, Pay宝 and WeChat have been singing along the road to globalization.
With regard to the globalization of mobile payments in China, Erie advised in the China Third-party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017 to summarize two ways: One is through strategic investment, export of experience, entering stock and supporting foreign domestic mobile payments enterprises.
Secondly, through the consumption behavior of Chinese tourists abroad, to promote mobile payment service to foreign merchants, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of Chinese mobile payment on the mainland abroad.
It's true, the Chinese get the world.
China's rapid economic development, coupled with its large population base, is an attractive figure for Chinese tourists to spend in Europe.
But it is also destined that the mobile payments battle in China, which opened up in Germany, will be unpredictable.
WeChat Payments and Payments are just moving battlefields to Europe, competitors unchanged, winning battlefields unchanged – or Chinese, globalizing too?
More pioneering is the question of whether China's mobile payments can open its borders in Europe?
Take Germany, for example.
A Magical New Retail
Chen Xian Lei and Yang Kean: When Amazon announced its entry into the top ten retailers in the world, bookstores and grocery stores were worth playing with, regardless of the timing or motivation.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
In early 2017, Amazon opened stores in New York City, and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost at the same time, Amazon announced its no-man's-supermarket (Amazon Go) to be tested, where customers will not have to queue for stores, nor have to pay their bills, and will be able to clear the doors, remove the items they want, and deduct the purchase amount automatically from their Amazon account.
As for Amazon, it's been a very surprising thing in recent years to suddenly move frequency over physical stores.
Because as early as 2007 in a letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon would not easily open physical stores unless the following four conditions were met simultaneously:
We must be sure that this new opportunity will give return to shareholders' investments;
We must be sure that this new opportunity is of great significance for the whole company;
We must be sure that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
We must be sure that in this market we have enough resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookstores and grocery stores, the two most volatile categories of retail entities, are also the first and last downstream rivals of Amazon.
Amazon's announcement of joining the two entity markets as it plunges into the top ten retailers in the world is a game-changer, both in terms of timing and motivation.
Does Amazon's practice contradict the assurances in the shareholders' letter?
Similar voices were heard on the other side of the globe.On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Yunsu Conference, Alibaba Board of Directors Chairman Ma Yun gave a keynote speech.
"From next year, Alibaba will no longer use the term 'e-commerce'," he said.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and in the next decade or twenty years there will be no e-commerce, and the replacement will be 'new retail'.
It's only when we combine online and logistics that new retail will happen."
Once upon a time, the three words "new retail" were magically placed on the lips of the industry.
But what does "new retail" mean?
This concept is not new if it is only combined with the pointing line and the line.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked the 180 largest retailers and estimated their total sales to be around $20 billion, while the top 25 accounted for more than $1590 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (such as Macy's, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that have only begun operating online in the past five years.
And Alibaba Group's 283 billion yuan share in Sunning Yun business, also has been on the agenda.
From a global perspective, retailers and retailers are moving from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers entities, retailers, mobile and socialized media.
Is "new retail" more of a summary than a prospect for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the wholesale concept and the new retail?
Perhaps the key to the problem is not whether the line will merge with the line, but how.
Looking back over the past 20 years, the rise of retailers, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, focuses on price and convenience.
Depending on these two pain points, retailers move very high standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom to the line.
With the cultivation of online consumption habits and the improvement of customer experience, the retailers will extend their reach to other goods and begin to increase efficiency.
According to Alibaba CEO Zhang Yiang, "using the Internet's ideas and technologies to completely reform and upgrade the total of about 30 trillion social retailers, China's consumers' increasingly upgraded consumption needs can be effectively met, and the entire process of product production, distribution and service becomes more efficient because of the widespread use of the Internet and big data."
Therefore, the road of the retailer is a surface light asset, the road of the real heavy asset.
"Light" means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not high in the traditional retail sector; "heavy" means that huge investments are needed in logistics, warehousing, etc.
The change in the logistics method ensures the high efficiency of the suppliers.

On January 18, Alibaba held a peak dialogue meeting in Chongqing, China, to promote precision poverty eradication and rural revival by exploring the new model of "Internet + poverty eradication".
After proposing a rural strategy, launching a Taobao project in the countryside, launching a platform to promote poverty alleviation in agriculture, and establishing Alibaba's fund for poverty alleviation, Ali's fight against poverty alleviation is a new "coding".
Strengthening the fight against poverty is one of China's most important national strategies today.
The total eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China in the past thousand years.
"A new round of innovations in the development of poverty alleviation is aimed at achieving accurate poverty alleviation and achieving accurate poverty alleviation.
The Central Government attaches great importance to the Internet and points out that it can play a role in helping to push the fight against poverty, promote accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty alleviation, and get agricultural products out of rural areas through the Internet.
As a result, Ali proposed a rural strategy as early as 2014, along with big-data cloud computing and globalization, as the three core strategies for Ali in the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the village Taobao (village gold mining) project, recruiting "village peasants" in the countryside, leading farmers from poverty to prosperity through retailers.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a channel to promote poverty alleviation in agriculture, and has now taken over 13 provinces and 120 state-level poverty counties.
The village of Taobao, created by Ali platform, already has 21,18.
Of these, nearly 400 are in provincial poverty counties and 33 are in 13 state poverty counties.
In 2017, China's retail market for Alibaba reached $12 billion.
Mr Zhang said that in the face of the country's strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of Ali's economy to get out of a new way.
Among them, Murano is Ali's main carrying platform for the eradication of poverty, and has walked through a new chain of eradication of poverty of the Internet directly for direct sales.
In the cultivation process, the villagers and the ant gold coat jointly develop agricultural equipment and small loan support.
In 2017, 795 ants served in 832 state-level poverty counties, providing them with convenient payment, credit and other services.
The birds deal with storage and logistics, the cats are responsible for sales, and Ali Yun's big-scale counter-feeding guides agricultural production, further improving the standards of supply, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of the rural economy requires not only products, sales channels, industrial planning, but also talent.
Through Taobao University, Ali taught farmers standardization, quality and scale-up methods of cultivation, and achieved the combination of "poverty reduction + supportive mentality" to make farmers sustainable out of poverty.
These courses already cover about 92 per cent of the state's poverty-stricken counties.
And the idea of "public-interest mentality and commercial means" of poverty alleviation can also ensure that Ali at the time of poverty alleviation achieves "true poverty alleviation".
Alibaba Board of Directors Chairman Ma Yun said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and wealth creation.
Poverty alleviation is to give people fish, poverty alleviation is to give people fish, to make farmers rich is to build a "fish ponds", to make farmers have fish to feed.
Industrial poverty alleviation, which is driven by the private sector, is fish ponds.
In industry poverty alleviation, Ali and Shaanxi Lochuan in cooperation created Lochuan apple industry poverty alleviation model, has been used by the relevant departments as a model to replicate and spread throughout the country.
Ali's work on poverty alleviation has also been accepted by the decision-making layer.
Alibaba's representative retail enterprises have been sent messages to ensure that farmers increase production and yields through offline channels.
Some of the villagers and ants dressed in gold were also invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experience of poverty alleviation.
At present, the United Nations World Food Programme's China office has been working with villagers to promote poverty alleviation in rural areas such as Anhui.
The 3rd New Economic Intelligence Congress, co-organized by Ali Institute of Technology and China's far-sighted intellectual community, was held on January 16th. Chairman Zhang Li of the Ministry of Commerce's Department of Industry attended and made a speech.
She believes that our globalization neglects the most important issues, namely the body and use of globalization, and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people believe that globalization has stalled, and many developed and developing countries, in the new phase, have different attitudes to globalization, different patterns.
The second concept is the question of the mid-term phase of globalization. What are the constraints of the mid-term phase of globalization?
The economic environment is restricted because the economic foundation has changed and globalization has been restricted.
Zhang Li believes that global economic adjustment is essentially over at the end of 2017, and that after 2018, a new round of growth will enter, the next round of growth must be productive.
7FRESH, Beijing's first fresh-food supermarket, opened recently and plans to have more than 1,000 outlets nationwide over the next three to five years.
In addition to Ali's box of horses, Evergreen's superfood, Suning's su su su su, and Mermaid's palm fish, "new retail outlets" have begun to flourish, and in innovative modes and even at prices, they're calling out to each other.
The fight for the upgrading of fresh-food supermarkets has become a phenomenal topic in the new retail sector. Where is the new retail?
"In 2018, we will be rapidly entering the country, and there will be a lot of shops opening in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.
Box马鲜生 CEO Hu Yi 10 revealed the 2018 "New Deal" at the second new retail summit.
"From 2018 onwards, Boxma is not just a fresh-food retailer, but a consumer-service life-class retailer.
Under the core model, there is flow, experience, and real sales.
Unlike traditional supermarkets and supermarkets, box horse fresh produce is a fun and delicious "net red shop" in the eyes of many consumers, and even some intermediaries have coined the concept of "box area".
There are advantages and disadvantages of online retailers and online retailers, but consumers appear in many channels, so both sides are trying the full channel model.
The industry believes that, against the backdrop of increased consumption, more and more "box horse" stores will open in 2018.
And box horses have been exploring from the original fresh to more consumer areas, predicting more innovation in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, online and off-line business models attract consumers, and fresh-food supermarkets open all over the world.
But these relationships go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
In the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed and demand for purchases has also changed, according to Yuan Bing, CEO and co-founder of the Big Rubber Cow Network.
In the past, the line was pure, the line was broken, the line was to defeat, the line was to counterattack the line, and now it's all in hand, because consumers have no distinction between the line and the line.
The conflict over capital has made the new retail brand, represented by the fresh supermarkets, more and more sophisticated.
The analysis suggests that the current competition of new retailers in the first-line cities is far from the red sea pattern, and there is still a large part of the second-line cities to be explored, the market still has a lot of opportunities and space.
Different types of industries will bring the development of new retail into a multi-faceted state of development for the layout of new retail.
CCTV's Financial Channel combined with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Financial Strategy Institute, compiled a dry article for everyone, which is the annual development report of China's consumers.
In this year, what kind of results sheet has been issued by the Chinese traders?
What are the development trends of global retailers?
We're here to unveil it to everyone.
Total sales are back on track for record growth
Since 2006, China's online retail volume can be said to have been showing a super-fast growth, it is estimated that it will feel that online shopping is very fresh, can not go out and buy things, too cool!
But since 2013, the growth rate of online retail has started to fall below 50%, and in 2015 it was for the first time below 40%, reaching 26.2% in 2016.
But this year is different, with online retailing accelerating again, reaching 34.2% in January-September this year.
This is significantly higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe all of you are walking around outside and finding that buying and buying is more enjoyable.
Of these, the retail value of real goods on-line is close to 5.8 trillion yuan, and the retail value of services on-line is close to 1.49 trillion yuan.
The share of the total retail of social goods reached 13.6%, an increase of nearly 3 percentage points year-on-year.
Students, don't doze, focus on, service online retail amount is absolutely a great achievement!
Secondly, French netizens who like to cut their hands, the per capita net purchase is $1925, and they buy the most products on the net, is clothing, no less than a country that loves fashion.
Is it the youngest who loves online shopping?
Helps you avoid becoming a next-generation startup
Amy Eret once wanted to survey the happiness of employees at her first e-commerce company, but the survey didn't work.
The replies received are often vague and helpless, and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she promised to use anonymous forms, some employees still did not trust the process.
Elliott, who manages Madison Reed, a 75-strong San Francisco-based e-commerce hairdresser, said the responses were "lack of consistency and objectivity".
So she called outside for help.
A new group of human resources pioneers has emerged, like a spring blossom after the rain, to help the company understand the employees' feelings.
They built and authorized software specifically for measuring employee involvement, allowing companies to quickly conduct polls on specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees, and, in some cases, allow reporting to the board of directors to be reported directly to the executive.
"Now, you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company's Fitbit," says Jim Bennett, co-founder and chief executive of Glint, a Hong Kong startup.Glint software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee loyalty.
In three years, she said, she had gained more insight into employees' thoughts and feelings with Glint.
In addition to quick surveys and public opinion surveys for specific teams, Glint also provides company charts showing which units complain most, which managers approve less, and so on – allowing her to get a deeper understanding of why.
Companies began to realize that they had to master the company's workplace culture so as not to become the next step. Before the step-by-step employee posted a blog article describing the harassment environment, the speakers were punished by the company, and then the step-by-step became a scandal.
For startups like Glint, the desire to oversee is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the financial-technology analysis website Let's Talk Payments, the value of global governance, regulation, and regulation industries could exceed $1.187 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a startup in Denver, Colorado, is committed to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, and they saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year as the reputation gained momentum.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla.
The company has recently signed up to become a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnosis” surveys, collect real-time confidential responses, and view hot charts of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous text hotline for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is involved, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and chief executive of Convercent, said: "The public opinion courts have taken over the powers of the regulators.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or unethical, even if regulators don't intervene, it could face high costs of consumer resistance, employee losses and involvement in lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 500 locations and more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees understand the rules and procedures of work and provide easy access to corporate headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company's headquarters telephone number or e-mail address to make a formal complaint and hope the headquarters can take it seriously.
It's often a terrifying and unsettling experience, as Ruby Tuesday's chief legal adviser, James Ventrano, says, noting that there is no good way to track employee complaints.
But now the company uses Convercent to find and solve problems previously unknown to high-ranking officials in distant offices, cities, or states – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair wage practices – faster.
“I can get a closer, 360-degree view of the work experience,” said Vitrano of Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits.
Quinlan said that since 2002, companies have been paying more attention to ethics, values, and employee respect, following the closure of Andersen's Accountant's in breach of ethical standards.
But it wasn't until "social media entered their own world" that companies realized they couldn't stop their bombs from spreading virally online.
"Before technology is used to monitor morality, people see hope as a strategy," he said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as a service and charge each company a regular fee for the use of the products.
Such business models and business opportunities have been supported by venture investors who have already provided support to the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, totalling $6 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, culture, and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that employees today have higher expectations of the workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just a bet.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and spent their time in a company with an active mission.
"When people are willing to join the company, feel their voices heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they're more committed to making the company succeed," says Nina McCarthy, LinkedIn Global Welfare and Employee Experience Vice President, using both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when their employees are loyal and respectful.
If a third-party analytics tool promises to increase employee loyalty and professionalism, it's no wonder they're looking for financial support.
Employment culture experts say it is very important to know the data on employee respectability.
But these data are of no use unless the company manager takes action.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing a change.
If change doesn't go fast enough, or if it doesn't go well enough, it can lead to disappointment and disengagement.
"If you want to look for 4,000 recommendations, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rass, advisory director at Cote International, a business management company. He has seen mistakes in some companies that rely too heavily on data acquisition.
Because if you don't go all the way, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I care?
"Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and is able to act on the day Glint reports the problem," Eret said.
After collecting feedback from employees about their frustrations with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she is able to solve problems by reorganizing the company's internal team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights from its employees who, in the long run, hope to be able to make a change in this highly talented industry and better retain their employees.
"If you don't focus on creating a transparent culture, you're going to lose talent," said Vitrano.
"If you lose talent, you lose customers.
And when you lose a client, you lose a company.

NCAA cancels twice a day of training and extends the daytime of the Bears
At nearly 11 o'clock in the evening, football players from UCLA's Los Angeles branch were wandering around the team's new campus practice area chatting.
Some players have already taken off their sports shirts and showed sweaty bodies after their first day of training.
For a large part of the team, these few minutes are rest time.
Players who participate in the summer course will return to the dormitory for the final exam after three hours of practice and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6:30 the next morning for the meeting.
"The next three days will be a good match for these guys," Bears coach Jim Mora said as Monday approached Tuesday.
The NCAA cancelled two practices a day (to alleviate the player's burden), but actually extended their daytime training time – at least before the end of Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at the University of California, Los Angeles are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already crowded schedules.
From cancelling training twice a day to more one-day training, the Bears began training almost a week before last season, with Mora training at summer school for the first time in six seasons at Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20, and then begin preparing for the September 1st Texas Farmers for the official competition.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule adjustment, although it would add another project to players' busy schedules.
"In three or four days, we'll give them a huge amount of training, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"They've just passed, they've been trained, they're all great kids.
I think we'll have more time by Saturday. It's really great.
As soon as the training camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles branch will stop training. Given the clear visibility of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center Senior Hotel has been struck by balls thrown across the back of the goalpost.
The Bears will be staying at the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits there may be problems once the rooms are vacated during the season.
"We'll take security measures," said Mora.
"It's a really worrying question. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in the room and record a training scene isn't strong.
If you have a training video, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures at Parking Lot 8.
We will use existing resources to do our best.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
We have made a plan.
According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), in the second quarter of this year, the value of housing in Australia rose by an average of 1.5% to 2%, up 3.5% year-on-year, the lowest year-on-year increase since March 2013.
Just as property intermediaries were expecting to sell more houses during the holiday season, Australian house prices rose to their lowest level since 2013.
IT House reported in the morning that the Wall Street Journal reported AT&T had cancelled plans to sell Huawei's new flagship smartphone in the United States.
Huawei originally planned to announce the partnership this week at CES, but AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response to this situation, Huawei responded on January 9, telling reporters that on January 9, at U.S. time, Huawei will release new products and specific listing information to the U.S. market.
Huawei said it has proved its strength in the past five years by launching high-end products on the global and US markets.
According to an earlier report by the IT House, Huawei will release a "best cell phone you've never heard of" at the Las Vegas CES on the afternoon of January 9, and the cell phone's power-up capacity will support two days of use.
It is widely believed that Huawei's flagship mobile phone, Huawei Mate 10 Pro, will be released soon, which will be on board the Android Oreo system.
The film "I'm Not Pankin Lin" starring Guo Tao, Dapeng, and Zhang Jian will be screened nationwide on September 30.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar on "The Sorrow of Comedy" in Beijing, attended by three guests, Feng Xiaogang, Ning Ho and Dapeng.
The characteristics of "I'm not Pankin Lin" are that it's a square-shaped alternation, and it's very fresh, especially in the round scenes shot with a masked lens.
"It's very similar to Zhang Ying's Autumn Kikuo's Office, and it's easy to relate to each other. I wanted to do it in a way that everyone hadn't done before. Actually, there's no special idea, it's just fun, and I want to do something great," he explained.
Feng Xiaogang described her work as a woman's work, learning how to make round images with photographers, and even spending millions of dollars to get photographers to make a ten-minute test film.
Facebook will introduce fact-checking to fight fake news
Facebook announced on Thursday that it would send more potential malicious articles to third-party detection agencies and display the results below the original post.The world's largest online social network, Facebook, is trying to crack down on so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that it would start using up-to-date machines to learn how to detect possible malicious acts and send them to the fact-checker, and may display the fact-check results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets for so-called fake news, and many believe that it influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe. Before the French presidential election in May, voters were flooded with false stories, and Germany took the lead in supporting the fine scheme before the September election, which would impose fines if social media networks failed to remove hate tweets in a timely manner.
Facebook said in a separate statement Thursday in Germany that it is launching a new fact-checking function test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which stories are being questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people also want more backgrounds to help them make wise decisions about what they read and share," said Sarah Su, Facebook news feed product manager, in a blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its "related articles" function and proposed other changes to its news to reduce false news.
A Painting Novel: The Story of the Castle of England
Recently, the small Scottney Castle became the protagonist of a compressed music video, and once became a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s.
But Scottney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in a comfortable location in the Belly Canyon, Kent, and now it has become the inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man with a particular interest in historical documents and a long-suffering head).
"I find it very beautiful to see the writings of ancient people 300 years ago," he said.
"What kind of human connections make this letter fall into my hands.
Throughout the Middle Ages until Edward's time, the book "A Castle of England" recorded the families living in Scotland, each story written by different future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This was not Rose's first book to use archives as raw materials: he also wrote The Tooth of the Dead and Other Stories of 2014, a book inspired by British library literature, a work he completed with uncontrollable creativity.
"I can't help but see the thumbprint on one side of the letter," he said, "which was written by a double agent working for Jacob in the 18th century.
That's his fingerprint!
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because at that time, you needed a fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, it feels like they're around us.
Oh, I like archives!
For those who were shaken by the old paper, being supported by the National Trust and the Arts Commission and living in the castle for nearly four months ("To tell the truth, I've been staying a little longer") seemed so cool, so unbelievable.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's "new" castle, looking through archives, studying the estate's many treasures and antiques, such as the hyena's head hanging from the wall, and bottles spent centuries in the protective river.
He wandered through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wandering people, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who drew illustrations for his books.
Then in the evening, he would " drink some whiskey and then write.
Scottney’s secret history is not yet clear, as the National Trust only entered fully after the death of her last successor, Elizabeth Heasey, in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began to deal with the files, describing them as "the nobles hundreds of years ago were going away: Oh, put it in the attic."
The diary, a letter from the British Empire, depicts maps of the boundaries of countries: "You would think land disputes would be boring," said Ross, "but there would be two families fighting for a white birch.
Let's go, guys!
Some of the stories are based on the castle as a starting point for a broader study of British history, including The Labourer, which clues a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
"The story in the book, Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, records a riot in the castle in 1380," said Rose.
"The peasant uprising started in that area, and I think it's a good place to start.
Maybe there's a connection between the two?
Other stories are deeply rooted in the castle’s history, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or, in The Smuggler, the story’s master is 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have buried himself by filling his coffin with stones (it was discovered several years later that his coffin was exposed to the ground).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite Scottish castle families: "These gentlemen seem to be unreliable, always borrowing money and spending money on things they can't afford.
Generation after generation of Darrell men solve their debt problems by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be a group of handsome young men who know how to pursue women.
With the end of his mission in the castle, Rhodes began to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness drawing a novel about Elm?m?nm?ki, a sanatorium in the early 20th century that was gradually abandoned.
But Scottney has a special position for him.
"I'm sorry to leave," he said.

Big energy companies are all "wealthy enemies," so who gets the most out of the world's energy companies?
Yesterday, the renowned PFC Energy Company announced the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011, followed by the US oil and gas producer ExxonMobil, which ranked third with a market value of US$40.63 billion, followed by China Petroleum and the Dutch Royal Shell.
On the PFC's list, China Petroleum has been in the top two positions in 2007 and 2009, all of which were held by ExxonMobil.
In the 2011 list of the top 50, three companies from the Mainland of China were included, including China Petroleum, No. 2, China Petroleum, No. 9, and China Marine Petroleum, No. 15.
According to PFC's statistics, however, although oil prices are much higher today than they were four years ago, the CEO of PFC Energy points out that there are many reasons for the low aggregate market value, including the decline in North American natural gas prices and the low activity in global stock markets.

Amendments to U.S. Green Card Provisions
The media quoted President Donald Trump's speech as saying that the United States would introduce a new immigration plan to amend the green card provisions.
The plan aims to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, with stricter requirements for temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications.
The new regulations were introduced by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in the two chambers.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, "This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save taxpayers billions of dollars, and achieve the above benefits by changing the way the United States gives green cards to citizens of other countries."
The law will replace the current scheme and reduce chain immigration.
This new application process is favourable to applicants who speak English, have financial support, and have skills that are beneficial to economic development."

Sex robots are certainly on the rise, but we should be careful
Just when you think 2017 won't be any stranger, a new technology development report has been released in the field of sex robotics.
That's right.
Now sex robots are a big deal.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) released a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
We need to get serious about the rise of sex robots, says Noel Shacky, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the breast and the type of nails.
"People are laughing in the back," Shackle said in his new report, "but the big companies are actually launching a lot of sex robots, and we'll see a lot more of them.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots, which have silicon skin, feel warm, and specifically use artificial intelligence to set up human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also "define" their robots to suit their preferences, from eye color, breast shape to nail type or color.
But even more worryingly, many robots with "personality" make "replica spouses" look sophisticated.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions such as shyness based on user-defined attributes of attraction.
Roxxxy Gold, a sex robot developed by True Companion, also has predetermined characteristics, including a slightly shy "cold-haired phalanx" and an "experience-loving" "cowardly Wendy".
"Roxxxy Gold robots have as much personality as possible as you do," says True Companion's website.
So she loves what you love, and evil what you evil.
She had a little emotion in those days like a normal person!
She can be lazy, talkative, or sexy!
The rise of sex robots has caused a lot of anxiety – not only because they have replaced real human relationships – but also because of women's bowing and knee-jerk characteristics and the hints of rape in a cool-looking (interpreted as "resistance") Farah.
True Companion describes Roxxxy on its website as a man's shaker.
"If a woman has a shock bar, why can't a man have a Roxxxy," the website said.
However, these sex robots are not just a love thing, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their emergence and maturity point directly to a darker, deeper part of our culture: the escape from perfect gender equality to sexual love with subordination as an additional option.
Of course, most men will not have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still at the edge of consumer culture.
But what pervades the margins can let us see the processes of this era in which we find ourselves.
Many people are neither cunning nor aggressive until free markets give them the opportunity to do so.
These sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are being threatened globally, and it is no coincidence that the White House also has a president lying about sexual violence against women.
The most frightening part of The Woman's Story is not the realistic picture, not the hanging corpse, not the eyes that were dug out, but the over-real imagination.
The Republic of Cyrillic was a leap, but now it doesn't seem far off.
The goal behind these sex robots is to use technology to create the most realistic female body possible (although in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have human touch and to mimic real human movements.
But frankly, their "personality" does not represent real women.
They can't break up, they can't leave.
They had no helpers, no follow-up stories, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking the complete illusion of slavery.
In other words, they are passionate slaves.
As of 2017, the term is commonly used to refer to women.

Trump’s Great Performance?
Let Mitt Romney become a common-sense shortcut
Political differences lead to polarization of American voters, and, from a microscopic point of view, they undermine American family harmony, something that is no longer surprising in Trump’s era.
Post-Christmas and Thanksgiving, the major US newspapers featured in their commentary columns fears about how to deal with Trump’s kin.
Usually it's thought that we're doing our best to crack our "filter bubble".
Less has been said about Trump’s power to bring his family together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long disagreed with Republicans in our house, is coming to New York this week to visit me.
She reminded me that uniting against common enemies can have a powerful effect.
Because she worked with Trump in the White House, everyone she knew, including Republican relatives who had been involved in political quarrels for decades, is now suddenly and strangely on the same line.
It is of course a good thing to be at the table, but I am shocked that, from a broader perspective, this poses a serious risk.
While the left has always been emboldened by Trump, the upside-down effect of his presidency has pushed us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, what we mean is the possibility that his bizarre behavior may one day stop.
There is, however, a longer-term scenario that is even more worrying: Trump’s “normalization” of relations with right-wing Republicans, who previously opposed Mr. President’s standards, now suddenly appear to be a rational symbol.
I’ve recently found myself thinking a little bit about Mr. Romney’s mad-ass version: putting a dog in a car, with 14% of his income tax (but at least we know his tax return), seems like a really minor crime compared to Trump’s.
After the Trump era has passed, the next Republican candidate will need only reasonably qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in the town, we took our kids to the New York Park rowing horse, which is the largest rowing horse operated by the New York Central Park Administration. If you don't need coffee, the three-dollar ticket is the most expensive one in the city.
The wooden horses sounded like thunder, and the central column was made of glass fiber, and all the clowns and animals turned their heads, looking at their shoulders in horror and peril, and the music of the bite sounded strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: the landscapes overlooking tall buildings have become obsolete, the skyline has become too familiar to provide too much stimulus, and the realities of cities do not support dreams.
Thirty-five years later, I have not fully forgotten that day, when I discovered that the "Swiss Cottage" was not actually a Swiss Cottage, but a theme bar called "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage", which I can't remember, but near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the circling horse in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone enjoys the activities that can be attended by two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the rotor horse, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a grocery store, I was asked to give one to five points for my transaction experience before I brushed my credit cards.
In my corner of the street, that's also the case, and you can also choose to rate with a 15% discount, which is for shopping at the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the pace of what is supposed to be neutral transactions, but also to put pressure on service providers to add personal factors to unnecessary situations.
The poor woman in the grocery store smiled sorryly while I was tired and credit card transaction experience gave her a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
It was the second time that Pistolis had left prison and moved to the hospital.
Last year he was taken to a hospital to treat a wrist sprain, which prison officials say was caused by his falling into a cell.
After the prosecutor appealed against the original misdemeanor, Pistorius was convicted of murder.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he shot Steinkamp several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria, killing him.
Pistolis claims to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder hiding in a separate room at night.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistolis, which they consider too cruel.
The State Prosecutor's Office said it would bring an appeal to the South African Supreme Court, which could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistorius faces a 15-year sentence.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the Administrative Measures for the Adjustment of the Structure of Industrial Enterprises with Special Funds for Compensation, which will provide for a total amount of $10 billion to promote the elimination of excess capacity in the coal and steel industries.
Recently, several local governments such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, etc. have come up with ideas on the reform of overcapacity elimination.
Among them, many provinces have even suggested actively seeking central financial support for their provinces to de-capacitate.
A clue is that only eight provinces have announced targets for decarbonization to meet 90 per cent of their national coal production cuts.
Xiamen University's Chairman of China's Energy Policy Research Institute, Lin Berqing, told reporters that the steel and coal industry's "de-capacity" depends far too much on the central 10 billion yuan alone, and that more money is needed from local governments and enterprises.
In the recently published rules for implementing coal decommissioning, Shanxi province proposes to restructure the Shanxi Coal Group into a state-owned capital investment company, reorganize the enterprise's assets and operations, and build a new business model.

Do meat, dairy products and chocolate help alleviate inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD )?
Meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares to your digestive system.
But a new study shows just the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
The disease affects the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 Britons, causing gastric spasms and diarrhea, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington often advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers have found that key protein amino acids - chromosomes - promote the growth of immune cells, which can improve intestinal tolerance.
Dr Marco Colonna, chief researcher, explains that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
To maintain balance between the cells that cause inflammation and those that enhance tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive and fragile tissues.
When the balance is too prone to inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
In experiments, a cell that promotes immunity was found in mice carrying special bacteria.
Bacteria need chromosomal amino acids (one of the components of proteins) to form the appearance of cells.
"We have established a link between a bacterial strain (Roy's milkweed, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial community) and a cell strain that can promote the development of tolerance," said Professor Colonna.
The more chromosomal amino acids the mice consume in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggests that if humans use the same method, which is to say, the combination of rumenic acid bacteria and a diet rich in chromosomes, a more resilient and less inflammatory intestinal environment could be created.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, a post-doctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that enhances tolerance when she discovered that one group of mice had such cells but another group of mice did not when separated from the same strain.
She suspects that this difference is related to the colonies of intestinal microbes (i.e., bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice revealed that six bacterial strains existed in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Small rats are fed in a sterile environment, so they lack intestinal microbes and cannot develop these immune cells, whereas the presence of Lyme disease produces immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultured Lymex embryonic bacterium in liquids and then transferred a small amount of non-bacterial liquid to unmature immune cells isolated from small rats.
The immune cells develop into resistant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be proved that the active ingredient is a byproduct of chromosomal amino acid metabolism, called indole-3-乳酸.
When the researchers doubled the amount of chromosomes in rat feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the chromosomal level decreased by half, the number of cells decreased by half.
Doctor Cervantes-Barragan explains that most of us, like rats, have the same cells that enhance tolerance, and that most of us have Lyme disease in our gastrointestinal tract.
Whether human beings can induce the development of cells in the body with chromosomal byproducts from Lyme disease, as in experimental mice, is unknown, but gene defects related to chromosomes have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
"The development of these cells may be exactly what we want," she said, "because they can control the inflammatory reactions on the inside of the intestine.
It is uncertain whether high levels of chromosomal amino acids present in lactobacteria may lead to an increase in the species.
Jose Mourinho thinks United have signed "genuine" Nemania Martić
On Wednesday night, after the first appearance of Nemena Matić in a match against São Paulo, Mourinho confirmed that United had signed a "genastic" midfielder.
Madrid from Chelsea, signed for £4 million, won the favor of Paul Bogba and Andrea Perera on Tuesday in the last pre-season match of the league ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid in Dublin, 2-1.
However, during the pre-season Asia Tournament in Brussels, Martinic was not in a good condition, finishing only 45 minutes, and Mourinho acknowledged the need for improvement before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, wisdom and a genius way of thinking -- he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him prepare as soon as possible.
Mourinho started the season with his starting lineup and, like Martini, newly signed players Viktor Lindlov and Romeo Lukaku also started the match at the stadium in Ingushetia.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho still wants to bring in three more players, but insists the club "does a good job" and has four first-class players in his mind, three of whom the club has already brought in.
"I am very grateful to the club for bringing in three of them," he added.
"I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a lot for me.
The Global War on Guardships Will China lag behind if it doesn't build such a warship?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new guard ships, it seems that overnight guard ships have become the focus of attention of the navy of the major nations. First, Japan has determined in the 2018 defense budget to purchase two new guard ships, so that the Japanese DEX guard ship plan finally has a substantive breakthrough, then the US Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest program of the USFFG guard ship plan, so where should China's new guard ship go?
With the deployment of a newer version of the 054A at the end of 2017, marking the completion of more than 29 ships of the 054A, it is close to the total number of the 053H series, and since the first deployment in 2006, the process of building the 054A has been twelve years, even in the world, to build so many high-performance general-purpose ships, except China, and only the U.S.-built "Peri" class ships of the last century in the 1970s and 1980s can be compared and discussed.
And the simple reason for building so many 054As is that they are cost-effective, useful, and additional to the many years of naval debt.
The 054A has been popular with the Chinese Navy for many years due to its high cost-effectiveness and good combat power. It has a discharge capacity of around 4,000 tons, a 76 mm main gun, 32 units of the Navy Red Flag-16 and Fish-8 anti-submarine missiles launched together, eight Eagle Fighter 83 and a straight-9 helicopter.
After all, it was a ship designed in the early 21st century, and its armament was put aside, and its power system and electronic radar equipment were very different from those of the current world's mainstream escort ships, and it was time to develop a new ship, as Europe's equivalent escort ships were already equipped with full power propulsion, small multi-functional phase-controlled radar, and large-scale helicopter decks.
So how China's new guard ships should be developed is directly related to its future positioning and to our Chinese navy's strategic approach.
The future development of China's navy will be to become a blue-water navy, and the future will be to go to the oceans, with rapid deployment in areas where China's immediate interests are intertwined, demonstrating the existence of military forces, and, if necessary, with strong fighting power to ensure that China's immediate interests in the area are not damaged, so it seems that the new Huwei River will be heading towards large-scale and far-ocean development.
Looking again at the positioning of the new guard ships in the future Chinese Navy sequence, the future Chinese Navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy, except for the necessary near-sea defense ships, other major ships will be composed of carrier battlegroups or biplane attackers battlegroups depending on the situation.
The role of the new protective ships in the future carrier battlegroups should be to serve as anti-submarine mainland and mid-range displacement positions, and in the bi-submarine attack group should serve as protective ships class, so according to such requirements the new protective ships must have a strong anti-submarine capability and good mid-range displacement capability.
Based on the above-mentioned location, we can boldly imagine the shape of the future home-made guard ships.
First of all, discharges will increase substantially compared to the current 054A class, with an estimated discharge of around 5,000-6,000 tons for the new class; the power system will be equipped with a combined power propulsion system consisting of a QC280 improved combustion engine and two diesel engines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in power; the armament configuration of the 76 mm gun and the 1130 anti-tank guns should be retained, but an additional Red Flag 10 launch system should be added, a 32-48-unit Red Flag 16 improved and Fish-8 fuselage propulsion system behind the gun, and an 8-unit large propulsion system should be installed on the rear of the ship for the launch of Eagle 18 and new cruise missiles; the storage and storage of two 10-ton helicopters
Thus, the overall level of the new guard ships will reach the world's highest standards, even compared to the US FFG.
Of course, the above concepts are only the author's guesses about the domestic new guard ships, how exactly we can only wait for the new guard ships to sink when we can find out exactly, let's expect together.

For some time now, everyone has been discussing the recent changes in real estate policy. Is real estate policy loosened again? Will the diversification of the supply subjects of land policy cause house prices to fall?
But when we worry about real estate prices, worry about macroeconomic regulation, worry about future trends in real estate markets, People's Daily wrote again, last time we specially discussed People's Daily's commentary on the timing of real estate regulation, and now People's Daily's commentary discusses a more serious topic than buying a house you can't afford to buy, which is that even if you can buy a house, do you have to borrow?
Today, we're here to talk about a more serious problem than buying a house: repayment.
China's growing housing debt crisis
The overseas edition of People's Daily published a commentary on the issue, "Prizes and Loans: The Joys and Sorrows of Young People in Struggle," on January 17, 2017.According to data released in November 2017 in the Third Quarter Report of China's Deleveraging Process, published by the National Laboratory for Finance and Development of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Centre for Balance of Payments, the leverage rate in the residential sector continued to rise, rising by 1.3 percentage points from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up from 3.8 percentage points in the third quarter prior to 2017.
The debt share of the residential sector in the whole real economy is increasing, and the leverage rate is rising faster.
Research shows that Chinese households' liabilities in financial institutions are mainly consumption loans, accounting for about two-thirds of households' liabilities and about twice as much as business loans.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, mainly housing loans, accounted for about 80% of consumer loans, but in terms of increases, short-term consumer loans grew faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China's household debt rate is only a statistic of the total credit received by the household sector from financial institutions, and there are many other forms of private borrowing, including loans to relatives and friends, with large-scale hidden debts.
It is astonishing to see that, according to statistics from the Suning Institute of Financial Studies, China’s population leverage rate was only 3% in 1996 and 18% in 2008, but has been growing rapidly since 2008, doubling to 36.4% in just six years. By the third quarter of 2017, it had reached 48.6%.
Let's look at another data. In May last year, HSBC released a survey report covering nine countries and surveyed nearly 100,000 people.
The report targeted the millennial generation of young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
The report noted that China's young people in their 80s and 90s have a housing ownership rate of up to 70%, far ahead of Mexico's second-largest (46%) and twice as high as that of the U.S. (35%).
The data tells us of a potential problem, which is that China’s residents now estimate that the biggest potential “grey rhinoceros” will be in debt, compared to incapable of buying houses.
Secondly, why is the mortgage crisis the most serious problem?
Like our previous analysis, although we have been saying that China has higher house prices, compared to other countries in the world, housing ownership rates in China are actually quite high, so it is unlikely that high house prices can't be bought. I'm afraid to ask a lot of friends now is it that you have to get a loan back?
When we look at the world's real estate markets, China's real estate markets have not yet experienced a major real estate crisis, except for Hainan, which we mentioned earlier, because they started late. But the real estate crisis in the United States was the source of the 2008 global financial tsunami ten years ago.
The cause of the real estate crisis in the United States is blamed on two houses: Fannie Mae and Fannie Mae.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold houses to low-income people at a very low initial price in order to expand their sales. In the good times of the United States economy, the real estate market was also a boom, but the good times were not long, as the U.S. economy began to stagnate, causing the income of home buyers to fall, and large amounts of household spending began to fall.
At the time, however, the status quo in the United States consisted of financial assets and real estate assets as a component of American household assets, with nearly all of the household assets in the low-income group in the United States being real estate, and most of the assets in the previous 20 percent of the high-income group being financial assets, resulting in the higher the debt ratio of the poorer households in the United States.
One serious fact is that these people buy houses when the economy is better, so the money to pay for housing is also calculated on their better incomes, and when incomes are falling, the pressure on housing is not only less, even because some sub-lending schemes are floating up, so that the real estate problems of these American families are gradually turning into real estate crises.
As a result, people are unable to pay for their home loans because of their low incomes, and banks begin to take back the property, and when the banks take back the property from homeowners who are in debt, they sell it at extremely low prices, which leads to a gradual decline in the area's house prices, which leads to further declines in house prices, and creates a vicious cycle, when more and more homeowners find that their house value is even lower than their own loans, and more and more people stop continuing to repay their home loans, and more and more bad debts.
Thus a great cycle of evil was formed:
The economic downturn--loss in income--some people can't repay their mortgages--banks sell low prices to debtors--house prices fall--more people stop paying their mortgages--banks sell again--house prices fall again
It's not just that you don't have any debt. If the money you get from the house auction is not enough to cover the loan you owe to the bank, you still have to repay it. Simply put, suppose you bought a house that was worth $300,000 with a mortgage of $60,000 and a loan of $240,000. When the house fell to only $200,000, you no longer repay the house to the bank. After the house auction, you not only lose your $60,000 in mortgage but also repay the bank's $40,000 debt, you still have to repay it.
Thus, under one and the same vicious cycle, America’s economy gradually collapsed and eventually triggered the 2008 US financial crisis.
So, at this stage, China's household debt rate has reached a high of 46.8%, a very alarming problem, which is still below the level of developed countries at present, but the problem has begun to appear, and the country has repeatedly stressed deleveraging since last year, which is a very foresighted judgement. If the household debt rate lets it continue to rise, it will inevitably raise huge risks, so it is important to guard against financial risks.
Thus, with the positioning of houses to be used for living rather than for speculation, the country is quicker to establish multi-subject supply, multi-channel safeguards, lease purchases, and so on, and take multiple measures to further defuse potential risks.
For our individual families, it is imperative to give up speculative real estate thinking, to exercise caution when buying a home, and to avoid the huge burden on their families. Only a reasonable assessment of their income and liabilities is a healthy family wealth development path.

The British inventors planted chips in their bodies and waved into cars
A British inventor who installed a chip for himself could open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car, becoming the first in the country.
Steven Notherm, 33, implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, which his company, BioTeq, has implemented through technology.
He has worked with Dr. Jeff Watson, senior advisor to anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hampshire, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implantation and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Notherm's company will also replace the locks in each room and vehicle for compatibility with the chip, costing £300 per lock.
The married father, who owns a child, has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4. He can start the car just by placing his hand on the steering wheel.

Thousands of White House Tools
According to military records published by Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Navy Army helicopter to South Lawn to demonstrate the enormous glory of American manufacturing, costing up to $24,000.
The Sikorsky VH-3D (also known as Marine Corps I when the president was on board) was an important exhibition at the White House on July 17, highlighting the activities of the U.S. construction project.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits featured helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the units operating the helicopter, Marine Corps Helicopter 1st Fleet (HMX-1), the White House military office requested that the helicopter be present on Regular Order (FRAGO), i.e., only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Grasse to participate in the "special" operation.
The day before the event, the commander of the HMX-1 said in an e-mail sent to the Commander-in-Chief of the upper ranks of the Marine Corps, "I just want to confirm that you know that this event has been given high priority.
The information indicates that the helicopter will arrive at South Grass on 17 July at approximately 7 a.m. to participate in the activities at 3 p.m. and leave the grass at 6 to 9 p.m. that evening.
The information also indicated that, in the event of delays in departure from the White House, return flights would require second-class crew due to flight time restrictions.
Aircraft crews were stationed on the side of the helicopter during operations, while security forces were stationed nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine do not clearly indicate whether there will eventually be a need for second-generation crew.
The Hague Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The record indicates that HMX-1 had questioned whether the activity violated the Act.
The commander wrote, "One of the questions we asked was whether it violated the Hague Act and was told it was not.
"It sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The White House defined the "U.S.-made" activity as an official activity and thus was not subject to the Hague Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the time, the president was pursuing the Senate's agenda of medical reform and extensively exerting control over government regulations.
It is no longer a novelty to use Air Force 1 or Navy 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes.
All presidents are required to travel by these aircraft.
However, it is not common to use it for photographic purposes only.
In February, Trump was caught off guard when, in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential machine slid slowly, eventually ending up behind the scenes of his first campaign rally, with his Twitter account filled with complaints about the former president’s use of the machine.
"The White House is thrilled with the 'American Made' exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said Lynce Waltz, White House deputy press spokeswoman.
The HMX-1 crew regularly conducted flight training in the Washington area and South Grasslands, where they practiced accurately placing the President of the United States in the White House.
In early July, during Trump’s G-20 summit in Germany, the HMX-1 exercised 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the US-made flight was part of this month's crew training requirements.
Helicopter forces also flew an additional 11 hours of "non-presidential support mission" that day.
The White House said taxpayers did not bear any other costs for the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging the South Grasslands helicopter exhibition.
The HMX-1 did not have a budget record of the President's flight, so it was difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense's estimated hourly cost for the fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D's Department of Defense can reimburse $24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded 30 minutes of flight time each time the aircraft flew from the base of the Marine Corps Air Force Base at Kuttyco, Virginia.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is far below the cost.
Walters said it was "very misleading to estimate the costs incurred by taxpayers on the basis of reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many others included in the annual appropriations for disposal costs.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense’s reimbursable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include oil, maintenance, and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press spokesman Sean Spike used the helicopter to defend the event,
"The idea is to showcase American-made things this week," he said.
And I know that both Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are proud of this, that they have contributed a force to our national security, and I guess there are thousands and hundreds of jobs that depend on it.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which is the result of the tireless efforts of countless Americans.
So it's certainly not inappropriate to point this out.
We don’t know whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while touring South Lawn during the event, but he did get into the cockpit of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump made a speech to Sikorsky’s representative, joking with the media about his own company’s aircraft.
"I know Sikorsky aircraft very well. I have three," he said.

According to the market star report, from 2005 to 2011, the province's GDP has risen from the centrally aligned "padding bottom" to the second place.
However, the economic growth in Guangdong province still faces difficulties such as low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest edition of the Economic Blue Page of the Economic Information Center of Guangdong province recommends to improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on some representative indicators of the province's economy in 2005 and 2011, we compare it with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic benefits, the high energy consumption industries, such as industrial energy and raw materials, which accounted for a significant proportion of the province's economy in 2011, were affected by market fluctuations and overcapacity "double pressures", while the insufficient innovation capacity of the leading industries, such as household electricity and automotive, led to slight profit margins.
But the large amount of investment does not bring the corresponding economic benefit, which is the main reason why the quality of economic growth and the low benefit of the province.
Experts suggest that effective measures should be taken to encourage enterprises to innovate, and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes should be transferred to enterprises in a timely manner.
Experts say that industrial economic benefits are not high, and that it is necessary to actively promote industrial mergers and acquisitions, optimize industrial layout and extend the chain of industries.

The General Union of Great Britain (GMB) is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union hopes that the management of the biscuit maker McVita will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Las Vegas factory.
The UK General Union's Scottish branch says the company has remained silent on the future of its investments in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 people and produces products such as hobnobs and rich tea.
The company has invested over £500,000 in the plant in the past few years, says Pladis, owner of McVita.
He added that employees and trade union representatives "will be the first to know" if factory operations change.
In a letter to the company's director, the UK General Union's Scottish branch called on McVita to "resolve the problem of funds not being transferred to the modernisation of production lines."
Drew Duffy, senior organizer of the General Union of Great Britain, said: "It's deeply worrying that we can't get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tolcross from the factory general manager.
Generation after generation of families work here, and the highly concentrated labour force in local communities and the Greater Glasgow region is an important pillar of high unemployment and serious physical deprivation in the region.
So, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising living costs and a long-term recession in manufacturing, the eastern part of Glasgow is in dire need of a continuous expansion of its production network.
A spokesman for Pradis said: "Tollcross has just received a letter from the Scottish branch of the General Union of Great Britain, and we will respond to it immediately, because we are committed to maintaining constant contact with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with employees and representatives of the British General Union to discuss some of the issues openly.
We discussed with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in competitive and economically uncertain environments, we reviewed our business continuity models for enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than £500,000 in the Tolcross plant, especially in line and operational improvements," she added.
We are fully aware of the historic status of Tolcross as a production base, and employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know if there are any changes in our operations.
China-China News Agency Tibet Monday, May 11 (China-China News Agency) - The deputy director of the Tibetan Autonomous Region's Sports Bureau, Nima Jian 10, said at the main camp in Bei Po,珠穆朗瑪峰, that the future waste disposal of Bei Po will move from past public-interest activities to normalized behavior led by the Chinese government and the international community.
On May 10, environmental volunteers will sort the garbage into trucks.
With the rapid increase in mountaineering adventurers and tourists, the environmental problems of the peak's location have become more and more apparent over the last decades.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Mountaineering Association (Tibet Autonomous Region) launched its first clean-up operation on the northern slopes of珠峰, clearing the remains of living waste such as oxygen bottles from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also broadcast specially at the World Climate Conference in Tokyo that year, drawing world attention.
According to Nima Jinin, after 1997, public-interest groups continued to clean up the northern slopes of珠峰, but most of the participants were non-professionals.
Paris Saint-Germain warned Barcelona three years ago about signing Nemar?
FC may regret dropping an olive branch to Marco Villati
After offering a £1.89 billion offer to try and enable it to exercise its exemption clause, Paris Saint-Germain will not give up signing Nemar, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago to attack the world-record striker?
The scandalous move has opened the door for a summer transfer, and the French club is set to break the world record for a second-ever transfer, with Paul Bogba returning to Manchester United last season for a total of £89 million.
Once the transfer is completed, Nemal will rise to be the world's most expensive player and the world's highest paid professional player – Paris Saint-Germain, which provides over £500,000 a week in post-tax pay.
Barcelona were angry at Nemal's way of attacking and getting out of the way, and informed Catalan board members insisted that the club had been doing its utmost to take care of him since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But has the president of Paris, Saint-Germain, made such a prediction of the world of football three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matadi in 2014, Nassir Al Khalifa issued a harsh warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in Paris Saint-Germain.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they contact any of our players, we're going to be in direct contact with them, and we'll contact their players too," said Al Khalifa.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign our players, they'll have to eat the bad fruit themselves.
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club appeared to have crossed the line, with Barcelona dropping an olive branch to midfielder Marco Villati of Paris Saint-Germain.
Saint-Germain, Paris, has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian side to leave in any way, and Barcelona is likely to be hit twice as hard by the loss of midfielder Nemal.
The International Symposium on New Energy Development and Technology, co-sponsored by National Grid Companies and the International Committee of Electrical Works, was held in Frankfurt, Germany, this week.
Currently, accelerating the development of new energy sources and promoting energy clean low-carbon transition has become a global trend.
In addition to the large-scale development and utilization of new energy sources, there are many problems and challenges to be faced and solved, such as system safety problems, distance transmission problems, technical and economic problems.
National Grid Company Chairman Shuin Biao said that National Grid Company is planning to expand the scale of the synchronous grid to strengthen the interconnection of existing regional grid networks and raise the trans-regional transmission capacity to around 300 million watts by 2020.
At the beginning of August, reporters in this paper learned that in the first half of this year, it is understood that wind-discharge is more common in the central areas of the three northern provinces of the country.
Salt City's wind power, photovoltaics and other new energy sources account for 70% of Jiangsu, and coastal development of new energy sources, local production of local consumption, has shown enormous advantages and potential in Salt City.

"Weakened fiscal subsidies, low rate of access to charging facilities, suspended use of three-yuan lithium batteries on new-generation passenger cars, face up to current upward pressures in the domestic market for new-generation vehicles
November 3 - 6, at the first stage of the 16th China West International Expo (hereinafter referred to as the "西博会") in Chengdu, Nanchuang, Yaan, and other six cities, the results of the developments in advanced manufacturing, among which the new automotive vehicles have emerged and new ones have been introduced, attracting widespread attention from the industry.
Currently, with the weakening of financial subsidies for new vehicles, the low rate of popularity of charging facilities, and the suspension of the use of three-yuan lithium batteries on new passenger cars, the domestic market for new vehicles is experiencing temporary upward pressure.
However, the "Sichuan-made" new-vehicle vehicles are reversing the trend, taking a big step forward in the market of passenger cars and commercial cars, what about the bottom-up?

LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The British Sports Council announced on January 9 the goal of winning at least five medals at next month's Winter Olympics in Pyongyang, South Korea, which is Britain's "greatest" goal in the history of the Games.
The British Sports Council is responsible for the allocation of funds for each Olympic project and, of course, for the achievement of medal targets under each project.
It is estimated that British athletes have hopes of hitting medals in projects ranging from single-board skiing, ice kettles, snowmobiles and short-distance speed skating.
During the past one Olympic cycle, the British Sports Council allocated a total of £32 million (approximately 2.8 billion yuan) for training for the Olympic projects, doubling the amount allocated for the Sochi Olympic cycle.
Most of this money comes from state lotteries, the rest from state finances.
Britain's hopes of winning the gold rest mainly on two men, one, Alice Christie, who won the three gold medals at last year's World Short Course Speed Skating Championships, and the other, the last year's women's ice hockey champion Liz Arnold.
At the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, the British team won 1 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze, their best performance since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
"Welsh AM worries like a fool
It was suggested that AM should be renamed MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament), which shocked many AMs.
This was proposed because it was planned to change the name of the parliament to "the Welsh Parliament".
The AM in politics fears it will make people laugh.
One Labour AM member said Labour members were concerned "that the name is associated with Twp and Pwp".
(For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, twp means stupid, pwp means big.)
One AM member of the National Party said the entire National Party staff was "discontented" with the proposal to change the name to another.
A Welsh Conservative said the Conservatives were "open-minded" about the name, but pointed out that it was easy to spell MWP Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh w is similar to that of the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission is currently drafting legislation to change the name, he said. "It is up to the members of the committee to decide what name they ultimately want to use.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act provides that the Welsh Parliament has more powers.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposed names, which broadly supported the use of the term "Welsh Parliament".
Regarding AM titles, the committee favoured the WMP (Member of the Welsh Parliament), but as a result of public consultation, the highest rate of support was the MWP.
Apparently, AM proposed other names, but meeting Chairman Elin Jones was pained that the disagreement would not be resolved late, as he was due to submit a draft legislation to change the name within weeks.
Legislation on reforms will also incorporate other changes to the way Parliament operates, including rules on the removal of AM qualifications and the design of committee systems.
AM will vote on the final name during the legislative debate.
Macedonia holds referendum on name change
Voters will be voting on Sunday to decide whether to change the name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The direct vote was intended to resolve the decades-long dispute between Macedonia and neighbouring Greece, a province also known as Macedonia.
Athens has consistently insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that Greece has legitimate rights to its territory, and has repeatedly refused Macedonia’s accession to the EU and NATO.
Georgian President George Ivanov, who opposed the name change, said he would not participate in the vote.
Nonetheless, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that better names are only the inevitable price to pay for joining the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
The church in the Harlem area is in jeopardy, and the bells of St. Martin's Church are in silence
“The old people I've talked to in history say that there's a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
Nowadays there are neither bars nor churches here.
He said the disappearance of the bar was a matter of fact.
"Nowadays people are starting to participate in social activities in different ways," Adams said.
"Bars are no longer the usual guest rooms on the street.
As for the church, he feared that the funds for the sale of assets would not be sustained as long as the leaders expected, and that "the funds would soon fall to zero".
He added that the church would be replaced by apartment buildings, where people would live who would not help maintain the remaining shelters in the streets.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will accelerate the total closure of the church, because most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of the church."
The two churches were built by the white community ten years after St. Martin's Church, before the Harlem area became a black city (1870).
The original White House of Councillors was disbanded in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshipping nearby acquired ownership of the building.
Under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black congregation, who led a campaign against 125 Street retailers, a major shopping street in the Harlem area, but refused to hire or recruit blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's parish residents planned to rebuild the church, they commissioned the manufacture of the organ.
His son, David Johnson, the successor of St. Martin's Church, the priest arrogantly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
Professionals who played the organ in July called it "a cultural gem" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The professional, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also points out that this is the world's first black violin played by Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago to play a larger violin.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not seek a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the Church's secular leaders and others by the Bishopric.
The parish administration (the parish council, composed of secular leaders) wrote to the parish in July expressing concern that "the parish was trying to transfer capital to the parish council" despite the fact that the parish council members would not be involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some parish residents complained of a lack of transparency in the parish's conduct.
A 13-year-old boy in California was bitten by a shark while diving to catch shrimp
A 13-year-old boy was bitten by a shark while diving to catch shrimp on the opening day of California's shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack occurred at 7 a.m. near Encinitas Beacon Beach.
Chad Hammel said in an interview with KSWB TV in Santiago that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends, and about half an hour later he heard a boy crying for help and dragging him out of the water.
Hamel said he initially thought the boy was too excited to catch shrimp, but later "he realized the boy was shouting, 'I've been bitten!
I got bitten!
His whole lockbone was torn," said Hamel, who noticed him as soon as he came to the boy's side.
"I cried out to get him out of the water: 'There are sharks in the water,' said Hamel again.
The boy was airlifted to the Radiy Children's Hospital in Santiago, where the situation is critical.
The type of shark involved in the attack is unclear.
A shark was discovered in the area a few weeks ago, but it is certain that it will not pose a danger to humans, Captain Larry Giles, a lifeguard, said at a news conference.
Giles added that the victim's upper half was injured.
For investigation and safety reasons, the officials closed Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours.
There are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them do not pose a threat to humans, he said.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will use the boutique styles of Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams to open a beauty channel with professional assistants.
With a large number of department stores entering the UK's £28 billion beauty market and the market continuing to grow during the fall in fashion and household goods sales, 11 stores across the country will be testing their beauty channels and, if successful, expanding to more stores next year.
Because supermarket televisions, microwaves and household goods shelves were once sued, supermarkets decided to invest in beauty products and use the shelves space.
Swansbury says it will double the size of its beauty products and launch more than 3,000 brands, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also gain more space, with brand areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket has also re-introduced its high-end cosmetics line to make most of its products purely vegetarian--a requirement of an increasing number of young shoppers.
Furthermore, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will conduct a franchise trial at two stores in Sainsbury's, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the other at Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
The current dominant trend is online shopping and buying small amounts of food daily in local convenience stores, which means supermarkets must take more measures to attract visitors.
The chain will offer more services and non-food to counteract discounters Aldi and Lidl, which will become more and more like department stores, said Mike Coupe, chief executive of the Essensbury department store.
Since acquiring the two chains two years ago, Sensbury has opened hundreds of Argos stores and introduced some Habitat. The company says the acquisition has boosted grocery sales and brought profits.
The supermarket had tried to redesign beauty and pharmacy before, but failed.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sensbury and Bodhi launched a joint venture, but after a dispute over how to separate revenues from Bodhi's pharmaceutical stores, the two sides announced the end of their cooperation.
Three years ago, Sensbury proposed a new strategy to sell the 281 home-run pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £1.25 billion.
Lloyds Pharmacy will play an important role in the plan by adding a range of luxury skin products to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, the company said.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Essensbury department store, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of the beauty channels and improved the environment for our customers.
We also invested in introducing specially trained colleagues who will provide advice on the spot.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every requirement. The attractive environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination and will be a big challenge for traditional shopping methods.
After Holly Willoughby pulled out of the £11 million deal, Peter Jones was "shocked"
Television host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million lifestyle brand deal and concentrated on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, which "shocked" Dragons Den star Peter Jones
Willowby didn't have time to invest in their home jewelry and accessories brand Truly.
This is better than Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced his decision to quit on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby quit her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute and turned to a lucrative new contract with Marks&Spencer and ITV, which angered Dragon Hole star Peter Jones.
After hearing the news, Jones was "deeply shocked" because it meant she would not have enough time to invest in the homewear brand Truly, which they collaborated on, TV Girlfriend admitted at a tense meeting at the Mallo Commercial Empire headquarters in Birmingham on Tuesday, according to sources.
The business is better off than Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, which was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million in assets.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was on his way to his holiday home by plane from England.
"Truly was Holly's top priority at the time," one source said.
This will be a long-term future plan for her for decades to come.
Her decision to quit was shocking to all participants.
Nobody believes what happened on Tuesday, because it's time to put it on the market.
There's a whole warehouse waiting to be sold at Malo headquarters."
Experts say the withdrawal of Britain's most profitable This Morning host could cost the company millions of dollars as the company invests heavily in products such as mattresses, candles, clothing and household goods, and could further delay market launches.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, now a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, and Jones and his wife Tara Capp, have been close friends for decades.
Willoughby and Capp formed Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as director in March.
The couple have always been on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the company's television productions in Borwen.
Willowby will be the M&S brand's spokesman, and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business.
After the talks, "We fell in love"
Criticism of the media, he joked, was perceived as a "loss of the presidency" and overrated by North Korean leaders.
Why does President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump echoed the voice of the “news anchor.”
"I didn't sacrifice anything.
He noted that the first meeting of the two leaders was held in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as an important step towards North Korea’s denuclearization, and that Kim Jong-un now intends to hold another meeting.
But negotiations on non-nuclearization have stalled.
Three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Yong-ho, delivered a speech to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, saying North Korea did not see "a corresponding response" from the United States to its early disarmament efforts.
He pointed out that the United States, on the contrary, continued to repress and impose sanctions.
Trump showed optimism in his speech at the rally.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"If we were to go to war with North Korea,
I'm afraid millions have already died.
Now, the relationship is not wrong.
He said positive results have been achieved in improving relations with Kim Jong-un, the end of rocket tests, the rescue of hostages, and the rooting of American soldiers' remains.
Moreover, when he talked about his relationship with Kim Jong-un, he argued for his own special method,
“It’s easy to be president,” Trump said, pointing directly at the crowds in front of him, “but we’d rather have more than 200 people standing here than having more than 10,000 outside crowded into this crowded place.”
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake destroyed an island, killing hundreds
After the Longme Island earthquake, non-governmental organizations abroad were told they did not need their help.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of the population, the government did not announce a state disaster, and a state disaster is a prerequisite for launching international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it is clear that they will not seek international assistance, so it will be a huge challenge for them," said Ms. Sumbung.
Save the Children organized a group to travel to the city, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Bali to determine whether international agencies are needed to participate in the rescue effort, said State Disaster Agency spokesman Sutopo.
Knowing that Indonesia is likely to continue to experience earthquakes, and facing the wrath of nature, Indonesia is still not well prepared.
Although Aziz has built tsunami shelters, other coastlines have not done the same.
Although the tsunami warning had already come into effect, Baru clearly lacked tsunami alerts, which could have been the culprit in causing casualties.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between Indonesia’s many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A medical ship originally stationed on Longme Island to rescue earthquake victims is on its way to Bali, but it will take at least three days to reach the new relief site.
President Joko Widodo will focus his campaign on improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure, and will spend heavily on repairing roads and railways.
But the shortage of funds has been plaguing the Soko government, as it faces re-election next year.
Soko also faces ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with the majority of Muslim members being more conservative.
Christian and Muslim gangs have fought in the streets with knives, arrows and other crude weapons, killing over 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands displaced.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores a goal in a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.
At 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, Stuart received a pass from Sherdan Shaqiri, where his team was 1-0 behind.
He pushed the ball gently to the left and then shot the door to the long column.
When the ball moves to the upper right of the goal, it flies very high above the boundary.
Eventually, the jumper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, fell into the net.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Stuart said, "I just want to get into that position, control the ball, and then players like Shaq will push forward as far as they can, and I just want to make it possible for myself as much as possible."
"I saw Kant come over, touch the ball, and shoot without thinking too much.
In the 25th minute, Chelsea were temporarily ahead 1-0 in the midfield after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal.
In that game, the blue forward passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his heels and threw the defender into Liverpool's half near the midfield.
Kovacevic made a quick pass in midfield.
Then, with a beautiful direct transmission, he brought Azar into the blockade.
Azar overtook the defence with a left foot shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker, hitting a long-distance goal.
At 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Liverpool will be at the stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy, to face their rivals in the Champions League group stage, Naples.
Chelsea will face Vidiotton at the UEFA Europa Leaguge in London at 3pm on Thursday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832 people, the Indonesian National Disaster Authority said on the morning of Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Authority, said at a news conference that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake reportedly erupted Friday, causing a wave of up to six metres (20 ft) that caused buildings to collapse and trapped many people in the rubble.
The city of Palau, with a population of over 3.8 million, is a ruin full of collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by police on suspicion of murdering a woman
This morning, a body was found in Birkenhead, Mercyside County, and police began investigating the murder.
The victims were a 44-year-old woman who was found to have been stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police appealed to the people of the area to jump in and provide clues.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in its early stages and I appeal to the people around John Street in Berkeley to contact us if they have any clues.
At the same time, I appeal to all of you, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if you find any clues in the driving recorder. The information you have is vital for our investigations."
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a Berkeley resident and that the body was found in a house.
This afternoon, a friend of the lady whom I know has come to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have said they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just wanted to return to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was dumb when he found out what had happened.
At the moment, the residents have received notification and will have to wait several hours before entering.
A policeman told a man that the entire area was marked as a crime scene.
A woman was crying on the scene.
He kept saying in his mouth, "It's terrible.
At 2 p.m. two police cars were parked in the line and a bread truck outside the line.
Several police officers stood in the guard line and watched the apartment building.
Any person familiar with the matter may send DM to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers (phone number 0800 555 111), quoting record 247 of 30 September.
The parliament's Clareville statue became the last monument to be subjected to controversy over the "rewrite of history"
Exile was the right punishment for the Taliban-style destruction of British cultural and religious heritage by the enthusiastic puritan followers of Clarendon.
The Cleveland Society, however, called Crick's suggestion "absolutely stupid" and "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about the removal of the statue, the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster will undoubtedly be the target of attack.
The destruction of idolatry in the British Civil War was neither directed by nor initiated by Cronwell.
Perhaps Clare's greatest mistake was to become the victim of what his predecessor Thomas had done in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's high-profile praise of Cronwell was a good demonstration of the 19th-century philosophy, and part of Cronwell's history, which many still regard as one to be celebrated.
Kim Smith told The Daily Telegraph: "Cleenwell was viewed by many as a defender of Congress's resistance to external pressures (for him, monarchy), and fewer people today would have thought of him as such in the late 19th century.
Whether this statement is completely accurate has been the subject of historical controversy.
But it is certain that the conflicts of the middle of the 17th century influenced the later development of our country, and Clare was recognized for representing the divided side.
His achievements as consul are also to be celebrated and remembered.
"Killer Pig" tears Chinese farmers to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man of Yuan's surname was found dead near a pig's neck in a market in the city of Six Ping, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday. The man's artery was cut and his body was full of blood.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai province, China, was preparing to vaccinate a pig.
The pig farmer and his cousin reportedly flew to the local market on Wednesday from Yunnan, a neighbouring province, to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his elder brother found out that the pig farmer had died and was approaching the door of the inn.
He explained that there was a large pig in the circle, full of blood in his mouth.
The farmer was reportedly killed by the 550-pound fat pig, which was confirmed by a forensic expert.
"My brother's legs are blurred with blood and flesh, and I can't bear it," Wu said.
Surveillance footage showed a man of Yuan's surname entering the market to feed pigs at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning.
His body was found about an hour later.
But the fat pig that killed him was neither of Yuan's male surname nor of his cousin.
The market manager told The Evening News that the fat pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others again, while police were collecting evidence on the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound fat pig pushed a Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife drove to frighten the animal.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was swallowed by his own pig, and a farmer in Lake Manitoba revealed to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "stimulator".
"They just like to play around.
They are curious, like children ... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will continue to bring large-scale storms to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa continued to move towards the northern coast of Mexico, and, as predicted, weakened after reaching the cooler waters.
But it is expected that in the next few days, Rosa will bring large-scale storms and flash floods to northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, the center of Rosa was located 385 miles (385 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, at a wind of 85 mph (85 km/h), a Category 1 hurricane.
Rosa is expected to continue northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low valley began to form in the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. "Rosa" will form a tropical storm near the lower California peninsula on Monday, when deep tropical humidity will move northward to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Subsequent interactions between tropical humidity and the upcoming wave valley will result in large-scale heavy rainfall in the southwest region in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause flooding, mudslides, and even mountain slope in the desert.
The effects of deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rains, flooding can occur with the rapid deterioration of conditions.
Desert adventure activities will be very dangerous due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to form turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms can cause local winds and dust.
The nearby Po Valley will bring some heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total rainfall could exceed half an inch, which could lead to slight mudslides and road slips.
This will be the first rainfall in the region since the start of the rainy season.
Arizona will experience decentralized tropical rainfall during late Sunday and early Monday morning, followed by extended rainfall during late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Temperatures across the United States will fluctuate sharply in October as the North Pole cools and the tropics remain warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over a short distance.
On Sunday, there will be a huge temperature difference in the center of the United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, California, and between St. Louis, Iowa, and Denver, D.C., will approach 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, there will be another wave of heat and expansion.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. will start heating up in October, with temperatures reaching 80 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 27 degrees Celsius) over a wide range from the southern plains to the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit (or 27 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday, and will rise to about 10 degrees Fahrenheit above average.
Long-term climate forecasts show that as of the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern United States were above average.
More than 2 million people attended the Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, the hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, accused of having sexually assaulted herself in the 1980s, will be broadcast on six television networks, attracting more than 2 million viewers.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues, and the broadcaster has disrupted Friday's last scheduled break: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has pledged to ask the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Cavanaugh was drunk at a high school party and wanted to take off her clothes by touching her body.
Cavanaugh responded generously, saying he was absolutely certain that such a thing had not happened.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 2040,000 people may have attended the hearing.
The company is calculating average viewing rates for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Other networks that simultaneously broadcast the hearing's coverage have not yet received the data, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen's statistics office often encounters problems with the number of viewers.
Objectively speaking, this figure is much larger than the audience size of a playoff football game or an Oscar.
Nielsen said Fox News had a total of 56.9 million viewers on the day of the hearing, putting pressure on other online media. Fox News's viewer was a strong supporter of Cavanaugh's appointment.
ABC followed with 32.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen statistics, CBS has 310,000 viewers, NBC 294,000, MSNBC 289,000, and CNN 252,000.
At the end of the hearing, the level of concern remained high.
Frank became the centerpiece of Friday's show.
Previously, the moderate Republican made a statement in his office saying he would vote in favour of Cavanaugh, who was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he climbed an elevator to attend a hearing of the Judiciary Commission and was screamed at by protesters.
On CNN's live broadcast, he stood silently for a few minutes while being condemned.
A woman said, "I am in front of you.
Do you think what he said to the people is true?
"You have a great deal of power, and so many women are powerless.
Before the elevator closed, Frank said his office issued a statement that he would make further statements at the hearing.
Television and radio networks were broadcasting the follow-up, with the Judicial Committee voting on Cavanaugh's nomination and sending it to the Senate for a general vote.
But Frank said he would only vote if the FBI investigated further allegations of the candidate's sexual assault next week, and a minority of Democrats have been urging further investigations.
Following a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Frank was partly convinced.
After talks with Kuhn and several senators, Frank made a decision.
Frank's choice was strong because it was clear that Republicans would not vote to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
Trump has ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a supplementary inquiry into Judge Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" on Brexit
In an interview with The Times on Sunday, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her Brexit plan of "playing a political game" of Britain’s future, harming national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend a Conservative Party meeting.
In another front-page interview, former British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson strongly criticized his so-called Brexit plan and said the proposal that Britain and the EU should impose tariffs on each other was "absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Louisiana State University players suspected of shooting Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a 20-year-old basketball player, Wayde Sims, suspected of shooting at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson fighting, claiming Sims had thrown away his glasses during the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reported that police found the pair of glasses on the scene, claiming to have found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police claimed that Simpson had confessed to killing Wayde.
Advocate reported that it was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head.
The police department thanked the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for assisting in the investigation and ultimately successfully arresting the fugitives.
Joe Alleva, a sports director at Louisiana State University, thanked the local law enforcement department for "working diligently and justly".
Sims was 20 years old.
Sims was 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall, a forward, and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was a member of the Louisiana State University basketball team.
Last season, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "very sad" and "unacceptable" about Wayde's death.
"This is the end we don't want to see," said Wade.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico City
The volcanic eruption of Popacatepet spread the ash from the eruption to the streets of the southern Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention of Mexico recorded 183 smoke exposures in 24 hours on Saturday, and then warned the Mexican people to stay away from the volcano after the volcanic vent activity.
The Disaster Prevention Centre monitors multiple loud noises and minor earthquakes.
Social media images showed a layer of ash on the windshield of a car near Mexico City's Ho Chi Minh City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital city since the September 2017 magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico.
The volcano, also known as the Smoke Peak, has been in operation since 1994.
Police clashed with separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum
On Saturday, thousands joined an anti-demonstration march to commemorate the anniversary of Catalonia's polarization referendum, during which protesters in support of independence clashed with riot police and six people were arrested in Barcelona.
A group of masked supporters of separatists threw eggs and powder coatings at the riot police, causing dust to cover the streets that used to be crowded with tourists, and were subsequently stopped by the riot police.
Later in the day there was a riot and the police used sticks to contain the riot.
The independents' supporters of the slogan "Never Forget, Never Forgive" stood up for hours against the unified protesters of the slogan "For the Year of Spain".
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protest.
The referendum on 1 October last year in Madrid was regarded as an illegal act, and a year later the situation in this region with a propensity for independence remained highly tense, but separatists in Catalonia were holding celebrations.
The overwhelming majority of voters opted for independence, yet the turnout remained low, as the majority of opponents of the partition refused to vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year police attempted to stop a series of votes held at polling stations in the area, which led to intense clashes and injured nearly 1,000 people.
On Friday night, they supported a group of independence activists to block the demonstrations and support the actions of the National Police.
The demonstrations continued, but had to take other routes.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, said he had no hope of gaining independence in Catalonia.
"We had the best time of our lives last year.
My parents were so happy to vote that they cried, but now we're in trouble," he said.
Despite a crucially risky victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s pro-independence faction is still trying to maintain its momentum this year, with several of its most prominent leaders either expelled or detained for appearing during the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his mobile phone, thinking the police were providing support, saying the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his participation in next year's European Parliament elections.
"As a candidate for election to the European Parliament, it would be the best way to publicly condemn the Spanish government's retreat in democratic ideas and repression," he said.
Delhi County, London: Three men arrested for driving into houses
Three men (aged 33, 34 and 39, respectively) were arrested after driving a car into a house in Delhi County, London.
The shooting took place at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
High-level policeman Bob Blemmings described the collision as damaging to the gate and the building itself.
In some cases, they may have intervened in the car's shooting.
Monga's goal helped Liverpool beat the Wanderers 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal was a victory for Livingston
Steven Gerrard lost the game for the second time in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the key to the win, and Gary Holt's team beat Hibernian in the second half.
Gerald's team still has no home wins this season, and they will be ahead of their eight-point lead Red Hearts next week.
Until then, the Rangers will play Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday. Until then, the Rangers will play Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Liverpool will continue their sixth unbeaten record in the league, with head coach Holt having not tasted the taste of defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston are looking forward to a chance to face a strong opponent
Holt's team had a lead before the score, and their attacks brought all sorts of problems to the vagabonds.
Scott Robinson, despite breaking through the defence, kicked the ball to the other side of the goal, and Alan Lithgow was dragged to the side after receiving Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts are very willing to play with the Rangers because they know that they can trouble the hosts when they can locate the ball.
This is how the key shots are generated.
The Cavalry lost a free throw, the Lions opened an empty seat, Declan Gallagher and Robinson formed Monga, who received a memorable point from the centre of the blockade. The Rangers lost a free throw, the Lions defeated, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined hands to block Monga. Monga scored a touchdown in the centre of the blockade.
At the time, though the Rangers had control of the ball, they found the home team's defense difficult to break, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had basically nothing to worry about.
This pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos snatched a ball from Kelly's foot.
Scott Pittman was knocked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Leigh scored another goal for the Liverpool side.
Crosses kept entering the Levinston ban, and was continually dismissed, and two points—after Harcourt's offer to have replacement Glenn Middleton play and a handball—were thrown back.
Analysis of Liverpool's "Super Performance"
BBC Scotland correspondent Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
The Levinston team performed brilliantly, amazingly.
The overall performance of the players was excellent, again exceeding the expectations of the people.
Since Holt's return to the top league, the team's game style and personnel have barely changed, but Holt's honours to the team are truly commendable.
He brought in a lot of heroic players.
The captain, Harcott, deployed a highly organized defensive squad, and Monega never let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall down in the process.
However, the vagabonds' morale is not enough.
They performed occasionally well under Gerard's leadership, but far from meeting standards.
Their last ball didn't go in - they only cut into the home team once - which was a wake-up call for the midfielders.
Eldon is happy in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), the last day of the Turkish President's state visit to Germany, the two leaders held a friendly breakfast meeting in Berlin amidst the clear skies.
President Erdoğan's visit to Germany was controversial, with the goal of restoring relations between the two NATO allies.
They are stuck on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Eldon went to a huge mosque in Cologne.
The city of Cologne has a large Turkish population and is the most populous city outside the Turkish state.
Police prevented 25,000 spectators from attending the mosque for security reasons, but there were still many supporters nearby who welcomed the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdoğan (many of whom were Kurdish) also voiced their opposition to Erdoğan's policies, condemning the German government's refusal to welcome him to Germany.
The protests on both sides reflected differences over Erdogan's visit: some German Turks called him a hero, while others condemned him as a dictator.
Road traffic accidents in Detroit: motorcyclists die after colliding with cars
A list of drivers died in a collision in London.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. on the British summer solstice, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy section of Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped to check, and the ambulance rescued him, but the driver was killed on the spot.
Just a few months before the crash, another list of drivers who had been involved in the collision were unfortunately killed on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said police were determining the man's identity and would notify his immediate relatives.
The roads are now closed and the buses have been rerouted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Violence injures six prison officers
The prison office said a riot broke out in a high-security men's prison and six police officers were injured in the riot.
At 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, on British Summer Day, riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcester County, and the riots were still ongoing.
Eight prisoners were involved in the riot, and all those involved are now in control of a building.
The prison guard face was slightly injured and received on-the-spot treatment.
"There are staff deployed to deal with the ongoing riots in HMP Long Lartin," a spokesman for the Prison Authority said.
Six injured police officers have been treated.
We will not tolerate any violence in the prison, and we will hand over the perpetrators to the police, who may face longer imprisonment."
HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of Britain's most dangerous offenders.
In June, the prison's chief was reportedly attacked by prisoners and sent to hospital for treatment.
In October last year, anti-riot police were mobilized to deal with major riots in the prison and were attacked by football.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which may benefit drought areas)
Tropical depressions are rare to strike Arizona, but they are likely to occur early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will strike the southwestern desert region, posing a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah (including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City).
Rosa is expected to arrive with rain later Monday and cross over Phoenix on Tuesday.
"Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status," the Phoenix National Weather Service wrote on Twitter.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that landed within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
According to the latest National Hurricane Cente model, the rainfall will reach 2 to 4 inches, while the local rainfall on the Oregon rim will reach 6 inches.
Other parts of the southwestern desert, including the central base mountain range and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall, and the total area is likely to receive 4 inches.
For those areas that are not at risk of flooding, rainfall from Rosa may be a blessing because of the severe drought in these areas.
Although flooding has been given high priority, moderate rainfall may also be beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently experiencing drought.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor reports that more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought conditions (the second most serious category).
First, Hurricane Rosa's path would cause it to land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa remained at hurricane strength, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Cape Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The hurricane was in contact with cool water on the plain and thus weakened the wind.
As a result, tropical storms are expected to make landfall from Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico may be high and there is a risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "the total rainfall from the lower California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is expected to reach 3 to 6 inches, possibly even 10 inches."
Rosa then moved northward through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm, reached the Arizona border in the form of a tropical depression early Tuesday morning, and through the entire state late Tuesday night, entering southern Utah.
The National Hurricane Center said it "expects that the main threat to Rosa or its remnant forces will be heavy rainfall in the sub-California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and southwestern United States deserts".
The rains are expected to trigger life-threatening flooding and mudslides in desert areas and mountainous landslides.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspected murderers arrested
A 16-year-old boy was found stabbed several times in the body of Samarcete, and a suspect was subsequently arrested on suspicion of a premeditated murder involving three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The injured teenage boy was found injured at about 4 a.m. Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was subsequently taken to the hospital, where the wound is now "stable".
The Avon and Somerset Police said the suspects (one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old) had been rounded up at night in Radstock.
The police called for clues to be provided by the dancing eyewitnesses who captured the video on the scene with their mobile phones.
Trump calls Cavanaugh a Democrat's "despicable anger bearer"
At a rally in Wellington, West Virginia, Trump said, "A vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameless tactics of the Democratic Party."
Trump said Cavanaugh "has suffered the humiliation and anger of the Democratic Party" throughout the nomination process.
Cavano emotionally strongly denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had never sexually assaulted Ford as a young man decades ago, in an interview with Congress Thursday.
Ford also allegedly attended the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the people of the United States saw Cavanaugh's morality and courage."
The president said to supporters in West Virginia, "Voting in favour of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote for recognition of the most accomplished legal wise man of our time, a public service lawyer with a mouthpiece."
The president indirectly influenced Cavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican elections in the midterm elections.
There are five weeks to go before the most important election in our lifetime.
"I'm not campaigning, I'm running around like this,
It's just to get you a good candidate," he said.
Trump says the Democratic Party’s mission is “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote on Cavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday at the latest, a senior Republican leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the death toll is still rising
A massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, killing at least 384 people and leaving many stranded as the waves rolled over the beach, Indonesian authorities said.
On Friday evening, hundreds of people were gathered on the beaches of the city of Baru for a party, when a wave of up to six metres (18 ft) was sweeping the coast, killing many people and leaving nowhere to be seen.
The tsunami was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a briefing on the situation in Jakarta, "When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were active on the beach and were unable to flee in time and were unfortunately killed."
"The tsunami swept cars, wood, houses, and all the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the high seas at 800 kilometres per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 evacuation centres in Baru.
A number of buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to disturb the coastal city on Saturday.
The region, which has 240,000 inhabitants, felt a strong earthquake.
The Indonesian Institute for Technology Assessment and Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the magnitude of Friday's quake was about 200 times that of the bombs dropped on Guam during World War II.
The statement also pointed out that the city was located at the end of a narrow bay, so the geographical location could amplify the tsunami's power.
Nugroho described the destruction as "massive" and said tens of thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the victims' bodies were squeezed under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction along the 300 km (190 mi) coastline of northern Peru could have been more severe, with the area of Donggala closer to the quake.
Donggara's communications "are completely paralyzed, there is no news," Nugroho said.
The Red Cross stated that the area had more than 300,000 inhabitants and added that Red Cross staff and volunteers were travelling to the affected areas.
"Although it's already a tragedy, the situation could be worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to inform the general public of the tsunami's impact on Palau, despite officials saying it occurred after the warning was issued.
In a video shared on social media by amateurs, a man in the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting madly at people down the street, warning them of the impending tsunami.
A few minutes later, the water walls ran over the coast, sweeping away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters cannot immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive blackout of electricity and cut off communications around the city, rendering the government authorities unable to coordinate rescue work.
Indonesian authorities say the military has already dispatched rescue transport aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuators are still in dire need of food and other essentials.
The airport in the city of Baru is currently being reopened only for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Baru on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
Despite the safe arrival of the staff of the Tonga World Proclamation Society and the temporary shelter in the company's yard, Doseba said, the scenes they saw on the way were unbearable.
"They said they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
As rescue organizations began the brutal battle and launched relief equipment, some complained that foreign rescuers with deep professional knowledge were banned from travelling to Baru.
Under Indonesian law, the flow of overseas funds, materials and staff is permitted only when the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it has not yet been announced.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'This is a national disaster,' we can go for international relief, but the current situation is not permitted.
The next night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, relatives of the missing persons still hold on to hope that their relatives will be able to create miracles to add colour to this tragic natural disaster.
On Saturday, rescuers rescued a little boy from the sink.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been pushed under the rubble for two days and whose mother's body was beside her.
Indonesian National Paralympic Team coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing paralympic athletes in preparation for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Monghi, were his students.
"As a senior skater, I have a personal emotional burden," he said.
Gendon said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread in the umbrella community, he was struggling to send a WhatsApp message to his rival in the Baru who was attending a beach party.
However, his messages always show only a gray pair, not a blue pair.
"I think that means the message was not sent successfully," he said.
The thief stole $26,750 from an ATM in Newport on the Levee when he added money
A news report released by the Newport Police Department reported that a Brink employee was robbed of $26,750 on Friday morning while placing notes in an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Dennis McCarthy of the Police Department reported that the driver had cleared the ATM in the entertainment restaurant and was preparing to put money in it.
Just as he was busy, a man "runs out from behind the Brink employee" and steals a bag of banknotes to be added to the ATM.
Witnesses reportedly found several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the case.
Anyone who can provide information on the identity of the thief should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Says the singer changed his name to "Ye"
Singer Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
He announced his new name on Twitter on Saturday, with the specific words: "Canye West, who everybody knew before."
The 41-year-old has been called "Ye" for some time, and he also used the name for the title of his eighth album, released in June 2018.
The name was announced before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The producer said he had replaced singer Ariana Grande, who had been cancelled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being a shorthand for his current professional name, he had previously said that the word had religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you' in the Bible," Vest said earlier this year when talking to the radio anchor Big Boy about the title of his album.
"Well, I am you, and we are.
Previously I used the name Kanye, which means "only", and now it's changed to Ye, which reflects our good, evil, confused, everything.
This album more reflects who we are.
Many famous singers have changed their names.
Sean Combs has used many names, most often "Puff Daddy" (P. Diddy) and "Diddy", but this year he announced that he preferred both "Love" and "Brother Love".
JAY-Z, which had previously worked with Vest, has also changed its name, either by using letters or without letters and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO declares no use of force against civilians
Mexico’s elected president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, reaffirmed that he would never use force against civilians on the eve of the country’s fiftieth anniversary of student persecution.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged "not to use force to oppress the people of Mexico" at Tlatelolco Plaza.
On 2 October 1968, while the Left Student Movement was gathering throughout Latin America, Mexican troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to subsidize students and open more free public universities to support the development of Mexico's younger generation.
He says unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead teenagers to commit crimes.
The U.S. should double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in AI research, the U.S. should double its research spending in the field, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was directed at the AI announcement made by various departments of the U.S. government, which, in general, lacks a formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, launched a plan last year: strive to become the leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"In this area, all the other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for new breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, so doubling the research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good start," Lee said.
Lee, who was interviewed this week by CNBC, said a doubling in funding could double the likelihood that the US will once again be a breakthrough AI maker.
Lee, who is CEO of Sinovation Ventures and has invested in Face++, China's best-known AI company, published last month by Harcourt Press in his book Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.
In the 1980s, he created an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the top-ranking American athlete, Othello, and later served as the executive director of Microsoft’s Institute of Technology and the president of Google’s China subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government science and technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and then asked what competitions would be launched to achieve the next generation of dreamers.
American researchers often spend a lot of money to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's robbing our academic leaders, it's business," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired top university talent to work on AI.
A change in immigration policy could also help strengthen U.S. work on artificial intelligence, Lee said.
"I think we should give a green card to Dr. Artificial Intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
In the United States, American researchers can receive funding from the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations, and in China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for researchers in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is relatively poor, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced a $20 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
Currently, the National Science Foundation invests more than $1 billion a year in research into artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US legislature, which has been calling for the creation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months, has yet to act.
Macedonia holds referendum on whether to change its name
The Macedonian people held a referendum Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would resolve decades of dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which has blocked its accession to the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, which retains the name of its northern neighbours, meaning that Greece has legitimate rights to its territory, and has rejected its accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents believed that changing the name would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and objections raised doubts as to whether the result would meet the minimum threshold of 50% for the referendum to take effect.
The question for the referendum was: “Are you accepting the agreement reached with Greece for the sake of membership in NATO and the EU?”
More prominent supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that Macedonia is one of the countries emerging from the breakup of Yugoslavia, seeking accession to institutions such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
“I voted today for the future of the country, for the younger generation of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means that all of us can live a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje.
Although not legally bound, enough parliamentarians have indicated they will comply with the vote.
But more names require a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.
The State Election Commission indicated that no reports of wrongdoing had been received by 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters participated.
"I voted for my children, we live in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum to change the name of the country, paving the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and moving the chairs in front of a tent built by people who oppose the referendum.
“Although it is for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), we want to join bravely, not through the back door,” Kavardarkov said.
"While our country is poor, we have dignity.
If they do not consider us Macedonians, we can seek the help of other countries, such as China or Russia, to become members of the Asia-Europe integration."
Overall, Zaev said membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia with unemployment rates above 20%.
"I believe the majority will support the referendum more because more than 80% of our population supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the EU," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the vote in favour would "determine our future".
According to a poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Policy Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – a figure lower than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of respondents said they planned to participate in Sunday's vote.
Of course, 70 per cent of the population said they would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum means that pro-Western government policies will be hit hard for the first time since they took office last May.
Watch: Man City's Sergio Aguero break through Brighton's tight defense to score a goal
On Saturday, at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton 2-0.
The 65-minute goal for Aguirre seemed to be easy.
At the start of the game, the Argentine forward received a pass in the middle.
He quickly ran past the three defenders of the Brighton team and rushed to the open field.
Aguirre then found himself surrounded by four other players.
He pushed a defensive forward and overtook several defenders on the edge of the Breton ban.
Then push the ball to the left and pass it to Stalin.
The British forward sent the ball back to Acroe with his first touch in the free zone, and Acroe hit the ball to the right of the goal with his right foot, knocking out Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Acuero's leg is injured," Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We've talked about 55 or 60 minutes for him.
He did it.
Fortunately, he scored at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who laid the foundation for Sky Blues' initial advantage in the Premier League.
That goal happened in the 29th minute.
During the game, Aguirre received the ball from the back of the Brighton team.
He passed the ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane with a beautiful straight pass.
After touching the ball several times, Sanay drew Sterling to the long goalpost.
The Sky Blues forward slipped easily into the net before sliding out of the field.
At 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, the city of Manchester will be at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, where they will face their European Champions League (Champions League) team opponent, Hoffmannheim.
Scherzer wanted to break in against Rockies
With the national team knocked out in the playoffs, there is no more reason to force them to start again.
Sezel hopes to make his debut against the Colorado Rockets on Sunday, but only if the Rockets are still immersed in the effects of the playoffs, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western District of the National League (NL).
On Friday night, Rockies defeated the national team 5-2, securing at least one extra card, but still hoping to win the first division title.
"If nothing else, at least we'll be able to play in Denver and the other teams will be playing at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
How can I be unwilling to participate in the competition?
The national team has yet to announce the starting lineup for Sunday, but it is reported that they are likely to let Sezel play in this case.
This will be Sezel's 34th start, as he began training at the stable on Thursday and will play on a regular rest day.
Washington's right-handed player scored 18 wins and 7 defeats in 222 and 2/3 of the season, with a defense of 2.53 and 300 triples.
Trump gathers in West Virginia
When the president talks about the importance of Republican elections in mid-term elections, he indirectly mirrors the situation faced by his chosen Supreme Court constituent, Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we do is about the direction of November.
There are five weeks to go before the most important election in our lifetime.
It's a big deal. I'm not running, I'm running all over the place to get you a good candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You've seen, too, how dreadful the Democrats are, and you can see it now.
They are determined to take back power by any necessary means, and you can see their ugliness.
They don't care who they hurt, and they don't care who they step under in order to take control, to get control, and they only see power and control in their eyes, and we don't give them that.
The mission of the Democratic Party is "resistance and obstruction".
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as angry, shameful, mean, hypocritical.
He referred to the name of Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which attracted a lot of applause.
"Do you remember how she answered
Is that the document you leaked?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, somebody gave it to me, and it's a very bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a Protestant party.
A man who can't speak straight
When the local Momentum party's activists voted to condemn me, I didn't feel strange at all.
After all, among my Labour MPs, I finally learned that I am not a popular MP, and the reason I am not popular is because we express our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, has also been treated similarly because of her strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
I'm criticizing my motion because I'm against Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, similar problems have arisen with regard to responsible economic policies, national security, and Europe, on which Jeremy and his predecessors disagree.
"We hope the meeting will be inclusive and yield fruitful results," a notice from the Eastern Labour Party meeting in Nottingham on Friday said.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night looked like this.
Unfortunately, today, this is no longer the theme of many conferences, and the political promises of “kinder, gentler” have long been forgotten, and seem to have not even begun to materialize.
The Labour Party cannot tolerate left-wing views, all of which are based on whether or not Labour leaders accept them.
The phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became Labour leader, when I had previously thought that my colleagues and I had the same political views, but they began to expect me to change my views, so that I could take a position that I would never agree with, whether on national security or on the single market in the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly, what I say does not matter, and what follows is a series of accusations on social media, demanding the cancellation of the elections, condemning centrist politics, or telling me that I shouldn't join the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
In fact, I know that I am fortunate compared to some of my colleagues, because my comments are often political.
Many of my colleagues, who are confronted with a flood of crimes every day, or with language that insults gender discrimination, or language that is racist, have never avoided, and I admire their professionalism and determination.
The most disappointing thing about this political era is that insulting language has become a norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church with many voices, and that one motion for “distrust” after another, one change to the electoral rules after another, has made the Labour Party more narrow.
Over the past two years, I have received many advice to keep my tone low, not to be so blunt, so that I can be "self-righteous".
But that's not my intention in politics.
Thirty-two years ago, when I was still a student at school, I joined the Labour Party, and since then, both as a member of parliament and as a government minister, I have done my utmost to seek better public services for those who most need them, owing to the neglect of the Sahel Government.
I never concealed my politics, including in the last election.
No one in the eastern Nottingham area would be surprised by my policy position and the areas where there are differences between me and the current leadership.
I would like to say to those who tabled the motion on Friday that I do not understand that you are wasting your time and your energy on whether or not I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party when our country is trying to achieve departure from Europe and is harming our families, our businesses and our public services.
In fact, what I want to say to my constituents (whether they belong to the Labour Party or not), rather than to Nottingham Momentum, is: I am honoured to serve you, and I assure you that any threat to your elections or political interests will not prevent me from acting in the manner I think best suits the interests of all of you.

Allied 38-17 Rick Merros: Allied wins again without losing
The last two attempts may have affected the final result to some extent, but there is no doubt that Allied was right to win this funny game.
They are now in the top spot, the only one of the ten teams that has not lost.
In the end, their excellent defence and extraordinary grasp of opportunities pleased both the home team and coach Peter Murchie.
"We've been through a lot of trials, but we've remained unbeaten so far, and that's why I must be happy," Merkel said.
"The honour belongs to Allied, and they have better grasped the opportunities than we did," said Robin Christie of Merros.
Grant Anderson attempted to temporarily lead the Allies in the 14th minute and was then replaced by Frazier Climo, but the yellow card encountered by Scottish player Laurie Hughes in the game against the Warriors led Melrose to a number advantage, while Jason Baggot seized the opportunity not to be replaced.
Before the midfield break, Crimo extended Al's lead by one point, and after the goal, he scored an extra point in the midfield break to turn the score into 17-5.
But Melrose did a good start in the second half, and Bagt's substitute Patrick Anderson's one shot reduced the gap to five points.
Following a long delay, due to a serious injury, and being lifted out of the field on a stretcher, Aaridh Knott restarted the game with a goal by Clifford McDowall, who was replacing him.
Following the yellow card warning by Allied deputy captain Blair Macpherson, Melrose once again took the lead in numbers, breaking a huge pressure spell with unchanged goalkeeper Bruce Colvine.
However, after the home team regained momentum, when Stephen Hutchinson was warned of a yellow card for hitting Crimo without a goal outside the field, McFon scored a touchdown in the back of the Allied attackers.
As with the restart of the game, Crimo was replaced again, and Kyle Rowe was sent off for the fifth time by side defender Gregor Henry after a kick from David Armstrong.
Still Game stars ready to enter the catering industry
Still Game stars Ford Kieran, who appears to be preparing to enter the hotel industry, having previously been found to be a director of a registered catering company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC television series, which he wrote and starred in alongside longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the show, and Kiran seemed to be planning to emulate Craig Lang's life.
According to official records, Kiran was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, despite a reporting source for the Scottish Sun newspaper suggesting that Kiran wanted to join Craig Lang's "red-hot restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia hopes the court will decide the way back to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in Rabas equipped with excellent equipment.
On public buildings, a blue sea flag fluttered in the wind.
From Lake Caca to the Amazon naval base, it reads: "The sea belongs to us by law.
It is our duty to take back the sea.
Throughout Bolivia, surrounded by land, the memory of a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, when the coastline fell into Chile's hands, is still vivid. Bolivia is eager to rejoin the Pacific.
This decades-old hope has reached its peak, as Bolivia, after five years of deliberation, finally waits for the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla explained: "Bolivia is dynamic, people are united, harmoniously united, and nature can expect positive outcomes.
The International Court of Justice will broadcast the entire adjudication process on national television screens for all Bolivians to watch. It is hoped that, after decades of time-consuming negotiations, the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia's claim. Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia a sovereign port of call through negotiations.
Bolivia's charming president Evo Morales, a native native who will also be interested in Monday's ruling, is controversial about whether he will run in next year's election.
He announced at the end of August that "we are about to return to the Pacific."
But some analysts argue that the courts are unlikely to make a decision that benefits Bolivia, and that if they do, nothing will change.
The United Nations agency, headquartered in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to grant Chilean territory, and provisions have been made that will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zárate, an international law expert in Chile, said the final debate had just ended six months after the International Court of Justice ruled that the case was "not complicated".
And the last four years have not pushed Bolivia at all towards that goal, but may have reversed.
"The current Bolivian government has blocked access to the Pacific," Zarate said.
She said Morales’ provocative rhetoric exhausted the remaining goodwill of Chileans.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue sooner or later, but it will be difficult to continue after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
The representative of Bolivia to The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, denied the claim that court decisions were taking place extremely quickly.
Monday's results, he said, would provide Bolivia with an "excellent opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the 139-year divisions of mutual benefit".
To the claim that Morales (also one of Latin America's most popular presidents) wanted to use the maritime issue as a political wand, Calzadara also denied.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to use the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
Judgments will create opportunities for us to overcome past history.
North Korea says it won't disarm if it can't trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho said North Korea would never disarm from nuclear weapons if it could not trust the United States.
At the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, Lee gave a speech.
He called on the United States to honour the commitments made between the two leaders during the Singapore summit.
The reason for Lee’s remarks was that more than three months ago, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore to restart deadlocked nuclear diplomacy.
Lee said it was "a dream come true" to force North Korea to kneel down if it wanted to impose continued sanctions and even oppose the declaration of an end to war.
Washington will be cautious about agreeing to make a declaration if Pyongyang is unable to make a major disarmament move first.
Kim Jong-il and US President Donald Trump both hope to hold the summit again.
But it is widely questioned whether North Korea will actually abandon its nuclear arsenal, which, after all, is likely to be seen as the only way to ensure its security.
Pope plans to visit North Korea next month to negotiate another summit of North Korean and American leaders.
Paris fashion show brings a lot of the latest series of headdresses
If you're hesitant about buying more hats or shading the sun, don't hesitate.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have launched the strange SS19 series of super-large headdresses at the Paris fashion show.
This summer, the most inefficient hats took over Instagram, so these designers brought their striking hats to the T stage.
One of the most striking singles of Warren Tenno's was a silver overcoat with a feather-shaped width that completely covered the models' heads.
Other large-scale accessories include jewelry- adorned pumpkin caps, sorcerer caps, and even pineapple caps, but these designs are not primarily designed to keep warm.
On the eve of New Year's Eve, Thom Browne introduced a series of unusual masks.
Many colorful masks, with two lips, more like Hannibal Lecter, rather than high-end fashion.
Some are similar to aquatic lung diving equipment, with breathing tubes and eyeglasses, and some are similar to melted ice cream eggs.
You will find more surprising findings as you continue to search for fashion props.
Fashion observers predict that huge hats may soon be on the fashion streets around you.
Rihanna, Emily Ratajkowski The "La Bomba" grass cap on the top of the head is very eye-catching, exaggerated and oversized, the cape is about two feet wide, you know, and then becomes a hot, trendy decoration.
The superstition label behind the very impractical hat splashed on social media and sent another important creation on the T stage - a strawberry beach bag that was almost the size of a swimsuit model. The non-practical hat was widely promoted on social media, and the fashion label behind it brought another great creation onto the T stage - a strawberry beach bag that was almost the size of a swimsuit model.
This orange-brown Lafi grass bag, bordered with wine coconut, with a white leather handle, is the eye-catcher of the Jacquemus'La Riviera SS19 series of Paris fashion week.
Famous fashion designer Luke Armitage introduced FEMAIL: "It's estimated that next summer, there will be all kinds of big hats and beach bags on fashion streets, because designers have a huge influence and the need for super-large accessories should not be overlooked.
John Edward: Language skills are critical for global citizens
Scotland’s private schools have consistently maintained excellent academic performance records, as have a number of delightful examination results in 2018, and individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other community work are all the more remarkable.
These private schools, which bring together more than 30,000 students across Scotland, are working under the auspices of the Scottish Commission for Private Schools (SCIS) to provide the best possible service to students and parents.
The purpose of private schools is to lay a good foundation for students' continuing education and higher education, career choices and social status as global citizens.
As an educational institution capable of designing and implementing customized school curricula, we are fortunate to witness that modern language has always been a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language they can understand, your words will go into their minds.
If you talk to them in their native language, your words will enter their hearts.
This reminds us that when we want to build relationships and trust with our foreign friends, we can't rely on English alone.
Private schools' language proficiency is at the top of the list, according to the latest test results this year.
Sixty-eight percent of students studying foreign languages achieved grade A.
According to data from 74 schools affiliated with the Scottish Commission for Private Schools (SCIS), 72 per cent of students in Chinese achieved A grades, of which 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and adolescents will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, as a subject, language and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are treated in the same way in private school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the reasons for employees’ efforts to fill vacancies were due to a lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in order to lay a good foundation for future careers for young people.
As more job opportunities arise in the future that require language, this skill becomes critical in today's globalized world.
Whatever your occupation, if you learn a second language and master this lifelong skill, you will have a real advantage in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign friends will ensure that people who know a variety of languages are at the top of the competition.
A 2013 survey by YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British citizens, showed that 75% of people are able to communicate well in foreign languages, and that French is the only language that uses more than twice as many people (15%).
Therefore, it is necessary to invest more in the language education of children today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, will provide children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school teaches a different language.
Many schools focus on teaching more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that they believe will be of great importance to Britain in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever language your child is interested in, private schools offer a variety of language options and are staffed with professional teachers in the field.
Whatever the future of children, Scotland's private schools are committed to providing a good learning environment where children can lay a solid foundation and provide them with the skills they need to succeed.
Undoubtedly, in today’s globalized business environment, language remains crucial to the future of the country and must therefore be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills".
Private schools in Scotland will continue to offer such choices, diversity and excellence to adolescents.
This must be the case.

LeBron will make his first appearance for the Lakers in Santiago on Sunday
Fans are waiting for LeBron James to make his first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the head coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play his first game of the season against the Denver Dragons in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is not yet clear when James will arrive.
Watson stated on the Lakers' official website that "the time will be between one and 48 minutes".
Mike Trudel, a Lakers reporter, wrote on Twitter that James's starting time may be limited.
After his training ended earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-season pre-season schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need a pre-season warmup anymore," he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
Donald Trump President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies in Wellington, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five meetings Trump plans to hold next week, including stops in some of his friendly states, such as Tennessee and West Siberia.
Trump’s move is aimed at gaining support for the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress during the November vote, as the choice to fill the Supreme Court’s vacant seats puts the vote on hold.
Time and how to watch Trump's West Virginia rally tonight online?
Trump's gathering in Wellington, West Virginia, is scheduled to take place on September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time tonight.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online on YouTube’s live channel.
Trump is likely to address the Supreme Court’s candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, at a hearing this week, during the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) investigation into a week-long suspension of Senate votes that has raised tensions over allegations of sexual misconduct.
But the main purpose of some of these rallies is to help the Republicans, who are facing the November election, gain some support.
According to Reuters, Trump's campaign said five rallies next week were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand their seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
A spokesman from Trump's campaign group, who declined to reveal his name, told Reuters that "congressional control is crucial to its agenda, so as the busy campaign season approaches, the president will travel to as many states as possible."
According to the city newspaper of West Virginia, "a gathering planned tonight at Wesbanco Arena will bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract a large number of Pittsburgh media to report".
On Saturday, Trump will make his second visit to West Virginia in the past month, where he won over 40% of the state’s vote in 2016.
Trump has tried to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said, "The president has had to do his bit in the polls, which is not a good sign for Maurice."
2018 Leeds Cup: The US team demonstrated its tenacity in Sunday's singles game
After the first three singles matches, Thursday afternoon's four-man game may be what the League needs.
Dynamic swing is a new concept invented by the sports world, and athletes have no doubt about it, especially in such competitions.
Now, where is the momentum?
"They were ahead by six and now they are ahead by four, so I think we have some momentum now," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, the European team has a certain advantage, currently 4 points ahead and 12 points in the next match.
As Spice has said, the US team feels a little uncomfortable, but there are many things to be encouraged about it, especially the performance of Spice and Justin Thomas, who played the whole day, scoring three out of four points, respectively.
From the pitch to the bowling alley, Spice was very deadly and hit the standard.
As the game progressed, he was screaming and shouting, and with two points behind Thomas, he scored a crucial push-up to equalize the fourth game.
His push-pull for the victory of the U.S. team, and the cheering on the field again, let's see, they believe the U.S. team didn't get out.
Spice said, "You really need to go deep inside yourself and compete with your heart.
This is where all the players are now.
18 holes to hit the ball.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more than either Spice or Thomas, an undisputed record in the league.
The European team has a strange but unmissable combination, four wins without a loss of ball, they won't make a mistake.
Mollywood were the only team that didn't play on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning after nine games.
This energy flow to and out of these crowds of noise makes it all the more clear that they are the ones to be defeated on Sunday and that no more popular players will be able to secure a European victory.
It's best to be in different caves at the same time.
But it is too early to talk about the European team's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly handled the morning four-ball hero Sergio Garcia, who was paired with Alex Noren.
A bourbon and the first nine "doubles" threw the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they could never climb.
But on Sundays, no one can help you out of the hole.
The four-man game and the one-man game are particularly appealing and suitable for close-up viewing, because the team's coordination, each other's suggestions, each other's reminders and strategies can change instantly.
So far, the European team has performed better and gained a clear lead on the last day, but the four-man game also shows that what people, especially in the United States, suspect is not true and that the US team is eager to fight.
The European team advanced 10-6 to the Leeds Cup Final
After defeating the United States 10-6 in Thursday's quarter-finals and quarter-finals, the Europeans will advance to the Leeds Cup finals with an absolute advantage.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, two of the most sensitive teams, took the lead in the game against Tiger Woods, winning two games, raising their points at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn attempted to regain the trophy he lost two years ago in Shenzhen, defeating the American team in the morning's four-man quarter-finals, winning 3-1.
The U.S. won two games in the four-man doubles, but was unable to make up for the lagging position.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to defend the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to score four points, and he and Molinari, known as the "Moriwood" team after this exciting weekend, were the second team in Leeds history to score four points in the opening four games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-man four-ball game, they worked very well together and eventually defeated disillusioned Woods and American rookie Brian Dechambeau 5–4.
Woods, who struggled to finish two games on Saturday, has now lost 19 out of 29 four-man games and four-two games, including seven losses.
Justin Rose, who hadn't played in the four-man game in the morning, returned to his partner Henry Stenson in the two-man game, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, placing first and third respectively.
Despite having a relaxing and pleasant day in the southwest of Paris, the European team did not do what it wanted.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-time top-scorers, set a good foundation for a two-way draw with the United States on Saturday.
They defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2-1 in the four-man quarter-finals, and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the two-man quarter-finals, despite losing two opening holes.
In Leeds history, only two teams with four points behind could qualify for the singles, despite the fact that the hosts, the Falkirk, had only to draw to defend the trophy.
However, due to ranking second in the previous two matches, it seems that it will be overtaken in the rematch on Sunday.
Without sufficient confidence, it is "absolutely impossible" to disarm unilaterally, the North says
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions have deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States, and that it would be impossible to abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally in such a situation.
Speaking at the annual United Nations General Assembly of the World Organisation, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken "many friendly steps" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and ensuring that it would not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we haven't seen any response from the United States," Li said.
"As long as we don't have confidence in the United States, we don't have any sense of national security, and in that case we're not going to be a one-sided disarmament 'headliner' in any way.
Although Lee reiterated North Korea’s persistent complaints against Washington’s “separate” approach to denuclearization (in which case North Korea would be rewarded for taking incremental measures), his statement seems to focus on the fact that North Korea has not, as in the past, refused to abandon unilateral denuclearization.
Lee referred to a joint statement issued by current US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during their first meeting in Singapore on June 12, during which Kim Jong-un pledged to work towards “nuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea has been seeking to formally end the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, but the United States has said that the Pyongyang side must give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected calls to relax severe international sanctions on North Korea.
Lee said, "The United States insists that 'non-nuclearization takes precedence' and pushes through sanctions to achieve its objectives by forceful means, and even opposes 'declaring the end of the war'."
"The idea that sanctions can force us to surrender is just a nightmare for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust of the United States.
Lee did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Trump, which US leaders stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
The foreign minister insisted that Kim Jong-un had met three times in the past five months with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding, "If the nuclear-free issue is on the Korean side, not on the US side, then the Korean peninsula's nuclear-free issue will not get into such a deadlock."
Even so, after “evil President” Trump claimed Kim Jong-un was a “rocket attacker” carrying out a suicide mission, Lee told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea’s artillery fire would inevitably be directed at the US homeland, but Lee’s rhetoric was different from last year’s.
Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised the courage this year of the United Nations to take disarmament measures against Kim Jong-un, but said there was still work to be done and that sanctions must continue until North Korea achieves denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timetable for this, saying "it doesn't matter whether it takes two, three or five months."
China and Russia believe that measures taken by the UN Security Council should be rewarded for Pyongyang.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Wednesday, "There must be continued vigorous implementation of the Council's sanctions until we achieve a final and fully verifiable denuclearization."
Since 2006, the Council has unanimously agreed to tighten sanctions against North Korea to cut funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile projects.
Pope met with Lee Yong-ho on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, saying he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
This year, Pompey had visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was not successful.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made if North Korea had not condemned him in a few hours for making "like gangsters" demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, the North Korean side pledged that we would dismantle missile launchers and nuclear complexes if the US took "appropriate measures".
Lee said Kim Jong-un told him that what he was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore, and progress in normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take courses to learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University has launched a new course that allows all undergraduates to get more sleep in order to resist the growing male culture of drinking coffee overnight.
One scholar found that the world's number one university, students often have no idea how to take care of their basic problems.
The course was designed by Harvard Medical School professor of sleep medicine and Brigham and Women's Hospital expert Charles Czeisler, who believes it is the first such course in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning, he was inspired to study the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and asked me, 'Why did I get to fourth grade and learn this?'
She said no one told her how important sleep was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, focuses on explaining to students how good sleep habits can contribute to academic and physical performance and improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Services, said Harvard decided to launch the course this week after discovering students were seriously undernourished.
An hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the classes, a picture of the dormitory was shown, students knocking on coffee cups, curtains, training textbooks and books, listening to the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on exercise performance, and the importance of pre-sleep activities.
In another course, students learned how inadequate long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
In the classroom, a campus map was hung with interactive icons that encouraged students to think about their daily activities.
"We know it won't change students' behavior right away.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know that smoking is harmful to your health," Professor Zeisler added.
He added that the growing pressure of modern technology and students means that sleep deprivation will become an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep and good quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, even to avoid gaining weight, because insufficient sleep causes the brain to enter the hunger mode, causing people to always feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who specializes in chemistry and physics biology, spent his first year at Harvard last year attending a course by Professor Czeisler and helped design the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to work hard to create a campus curriculum.
Next, he hoped that all graduate students would complete similar courses before joining the competition.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider setting up a bedtime alarm and a wake-up clock, paying attention to the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting devices, as this may lead to a loss of control of people's day and night habits, thereby making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Defeated the Wanderers: Monaco's goal forced Gerrard to lag behind
Due to Dolly Menga's goal, Steven Gerrard defeated Liverpool 1-0 and the Rangers lost again.
Ebroke had hoped to record his first home win since a 4-1 victory over St. John's in February, but Gary Holt's team suffered a second loss since Gerard coached 18 games, leaving his team 8 points behind in the league's top-league rival Hartz.
Montgomery scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' squad lacked momentum and seemed unable to defeat each other.
The Wanderers are now down to sixth place, while Levinston is up to third, with a net score of just behind the Hebronians.
An object thrown at the end of the game injured bound referee Calum Spence's head, which could cause further trouble for the wagers.
Jared made eight substitutions to sweep the Allies into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt has also chosen 11 Levinston players who scored one point last week for the Harts, and he would be satisfied if these well-trained teams were able to keep up with their opponents in every round.
The Rangers may have taken the initiative, but Stevenston was exceptionally good at controlling the ball.
They should have scored in two minutes, but the midfielder missed a great opportunity by passing the first pass to Scott Pittman over Allan McGregor.
Later, a deep free throw by Keaghan Jacobs transferred the ball to captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow hit the back post.
The Wanderers did take control of the situation, but for a third of the finals, they seemed to have more hope than faith in themselves.
As the game progressed, Alfredo Morelos and Steven Lawless collided, and Morelos thought he would get a point, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's appeal.
The Wanderers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ebroke goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by the header of Lassana Coulibaly and midfielder Ovie Ejaria.
Although Levinston's opening in the 34th minute may have been a disadvantage to the pace of the game, no one denied their difficulty in matching the result.
The vagabonds once again plunged deep into Jacobs' elaborate defenses.
When Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not react, and Arfield calmly determined that Monger would complete a simple shot.
Gerald replaced Ryan Kent with Curry Barley during the midfield break, a move that almost instantly created an effect, leaving the position of forward Morelos vacant, but impressive Kelly pushed forward from his defence line.
However, Levinston continued to attract fans' eyes in the way they enjoyed, with Lisgo and Harcott playing one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the finals, but McGregor managed to catch up well with Jacobs' attack before Rizgo scored a cornered goal.
The Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton again applied for a point after a dispute with Jacobs, but Tomson disappeared again.
Yearbook: The inventors of the Geiger counter
Next, the contents of the Sunday Morning Herald's yearbook: On 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, it is estimated that the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually evolved into a device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become the centerpiece of popular culture, just as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, cowboys who appear unlikely to become scientists in the 1950s movie The Clock of Colorado, have said:
The man: What the hell is this
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
After wearing an earpiece, you can even hear the effects of atoms released by radiation in minerals.
Evans: You have to shrink. It's going to be especially popular!
"'Hans' Gage died on the eve of his 63rd birthday in 1945.
However, the invention named after him will last forever.
New cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "discover" independent cells
New cancer vaccines can train the immune system to "discover" and kill independent cells
Vaccines train the immune system to recognize independent cells so that they can be used for treatment
This method requires the removal of immune cells from the patient's body and then changes to them in the lab
In this way, you can "discover" a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject it
A test vaccine has been successful in several cancer patients.
The vaccine, which trains the immune system to recognize independent cells, has been used to treat a woman whose ovarian cancer has disappeared for 18 months.
This method involves taking immune cells from the patient, then modifying them in the laboratory, allowing them to “discover” a protein called HER2, which is common in many cancers, and then injecting it back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our test results show that we are about to get a very promising vaccine.
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 "is a factor in the development of several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer."
Immune cells are extracted from the patient's body and then "trained" to locate cancer cells, using similar methods that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a leukemia.
Kanye West, who had previously played in the SNL with a MAGA hat, faced rebuke for supporting Trump.
The result is not so good
On Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was caught lying in an open speech praising US President Donald Trump and saying he should participate in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, in a hat of "Make America Great", he began to appeal to the Republicans and reaffirm his support for Trump.
Many times when I talk to white people, they say, “How would you like Trump, who is racist?”
"Well, if I was worried about racial discrimination, I wouldn't have moved out of the United States a long time ago," Veste said.
SNL began with a funny short drama starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars mocked Brad Kavanaugh for the testimony he provided before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault charges against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the show was not aired, the footage of West roaring was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is now difficult to determine whether Locke released the video to mock Veste.
Meanwhile, West complained to the audience that he had spent a difficult time behind the scenes wearing a hat.
According to the Washington Post, he said, "They're cheating on me in the back row.
They said, Don't go out with that hat.
They deceived me!
Then they say I'm in trouble."
'Do you want to know what the dilemma is,' he continued, 'because that means you won't be able to tell me what to do.Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
According to Variety, his comments at least twice caused audiences to lie, and SNL performers seemed embarrassed, with one of them telling reporters: "The entire showroom was in dead silence.
West was invited as the latest replacement for singer Ariana Grande, Grande's ex-boyfriend, saying singer Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West dressed in a Perrier Bottle and sang the song "I Love It", a move that puzzled many.
Vest was supported by Conservative leader Candice Turner of TPUSA, who tweeted, "Welcome to the most fearless: thank you for your bravery in resisting the mob."
But talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that Veste was just "brave enough to be yourself, it's just amazing."
"But I won't reward (buy his music, clothes, or support his "art") those I think are accepting and spreading ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He is free.
We are, too," Hunt added.
Before the performance, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "officially Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to be renamed Diddy (also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy or P Diddy).
The singer, Snoop Dogg, used the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, before the artist was known as Prince.
In a restaurant in Belfast, a case of premeditated stabbing occurred
A 45-year-old man was charged with a premeditated murder in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the scene was found at the Ballyhackamore restaurant.
The defendant is expected to appear in court on Monday to receive an inquiry from the Belfast District Court.
The prosecution will examine the allegations.
"Kit Harington: The Game of Power"
Kit Harington plays Jon Snow in HBO's medieval drama series Game of Power, known to the public as the hero with the sword.
Kit, 31, has been fiercely critical of people's stereotype of him as a hard-headed hero, saying such roles on screen mean that young people always feel they have to be cool to be respected.
In a cultural column in The Sunday Times, Kit said he believed there was "a problem" and threw out the question of how to solve the "poisonous" male temperament of the #MeToo (me) personality age.
Kit recently married actress Rose Leslie of the same age who starred in The Game of Power.Kit admits he has a "very strong" feeling that the problem needs to be solved.
"I have a very strong feeling at the moment," he said, "and what's wrong with our male temperament?"
"What have we been teaching them as they have grown up, from the point of view of the problem we are aware of at the moment?"
Kit believes that "toxic" boys are so popular that television may have a major role to play because the personality they display on television is highly masculinized.
He continued, "Which are born, and which are learned afterwards?
What's on TV and in the streets that makes these young people feel that they don't have to be that way to be a man?
I think this really is one of the most serious issues of our time. How should we change this?
Because there is a problem with young people.
He also admitted in an interview that this season's power game would be slaughtered next summer, and that he would not appear in any prequels or sequels afterwards, saying he "was tired of battlefields and horse fights".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and a brother who is a thief.
Kit recently revealed that he felt he was in the power game, and that the happiest thing was meeting his wife Rose.
"I met my wife in the show, and that's what gave me my family and my life now," he said.
In The Game of Power, Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, the character Kit plays.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: A 14% increase in new cases of AIDS in China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of AIDS patients.
China has more than 820,000 people infected with AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new infections are transmitted through sexual activity, which is a historic change.
In the past, the main way of rapidly spreading AIDS in parts of China was through the transmission of infected blood.
At a meeting in Yunnan province, China's National Security Commission said that the number of people infected with HIV would almost be zero.
But at the same time, the number of HIV-infected in China has risen by 10 million compared to last year.
Sexual transmission of HIV has become a serious problem for LGBT people in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized in China, but discrimination against LGBT people remains widespread.
China's values are relatively conservative, and research estimates that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with men end up marrying women.
The spread of many diseases stems from the lack of protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to disseminate AIDS drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied leaking Republican senators' information to others, sparking "dangerous lies" and conspiracy theories
On Saturday, U.S. Senator Maxine Waters condemned members of the House of Representatives for posting the personal details of three Republican US senators on members' Wikipedia pages.
Maxine Waters (L.A. Democrat) said the statement provoked criticism from "extreme right" experts and the website.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said, "Lies, lies, are all mean lies."
The information reportedly included the family addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet Thursday from the Hill of Congress, where an unknown person attended a Senate panel hearing against the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, for alleged sexual misconduct.
The information leaked some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
According to Hill, reports from conservation sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP address of the information release device had been determined to be related to Waters's office and that information had been disclosed to one of Waters' employees.
Waters continued, "This is a ridiculous statement, a complete lie, an absolute lie.
"My staff are definitely not the ones who leaked the information, which is a liar's lie and harms their identity, personal information and security.
This is a ridiculous statement, a complete lie, an absolute lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism from Internet users, including former White House press spokesman Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, "Her denials are full of anger."
This means that her temper is not fit to be a member of Congress.
Anger is the most important thing when you are accused of being wronged by others.
There is no one in sight.
The motives of the accused must not be questioned.
You must be calm and calm.
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, whose performance at Thursday's hearing appears to have been criticized for being too angry.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate intended to replace Waters in the midterm election, also expressed his views on Twitter.
He said on Twitter, "If that's the case, don't exaggerate so much."
Waters said in a statement that her office had reminded "the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned that these allegations were fraudulent".
She continued, "We need to ensure that the culprits are found, that they are held legally accountable for what they have done, and that they have had a destructive impact on me and my staff."
Movie review: Robin Akinson recreates the funny spy figure
Current films reflect some of the meanings of Brexit and tend to be British. The same is true of the English action-comedy horror film The Witch's Witch, which premiered in 2003 and the second in 2011.
This joking irony that there are no new export opportunities ironically shows how worthless we are.
In any case, the staring, faceless Johnny English once again got permission to mess things up, and his name was more expressive, indicating precisely the creation of this well-known comedian, aimed at non-English-speaking viewers.
Despite his selfish desire to look elegant and charming, he couldn’t get rid of the silly secret agent image of Cross and Beans and the boy who played the theme song of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, Chariots of Fire.
Initially he was a traveler and international mysterious man in the ABC commercials Akinson, always making a pile of crap, although these ads have been forgotten.
There are a couple of bright spots when Anglis goes out in this bean-sweet work.
I like Johnny English in his medieval helmet near the helicopter, when the spinning blade hits on his helmet and gives off a bit of a whisper.
Akinson's talent for action comedy was well-known, but his sense of humor was inadequate, strange, and compelling, especially for "serious" movie brands such as "007" and "Spionage", and he is now confident in incorporating comedy elements.
This sense of humor is aimed at children rather than adults, and I personally feel that, in contrast to the jokes made by Akinson in the silent movies about beans, Johnny English's strange outbursts are lacking in creativity and cohesion.
The theme of the current year is the main theme of Britain's serious dilemma.
A network hacker infiltrated the UK's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents, which crippled the minds of the detective Kevin Eldon.
The Prime Minister's character is exuberant, troubled, and politically unpopular: Emma Thompson does her best on the outside to show the characteristics of Theresa May, but there is not a single word in the film.
Her intelligence adviser told her that all existing spies had been exposed and could only find someone from the retired agent to take over the duties.
The only choice is the clumsy Johnny English, now a retired headmaster at a luxury institution, but teaching how to become a hidden agent in private: the new burden here is that English has opened a rock-and-roll campus-style spying school.
English is quickly taken back to the White House, attending an emergency press conference, and reunited with a long-suffering old friend, Bow (represented again by Ben Miller).
Bob is now home and a bit of a waste to Vicki Pepperdine. Bob is now a married man, his wife is a submarine commander, and the character is a bit of a fancy one, and Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a lazy one.
So Batman and Robin, who made a big mistake in Her Majesty's Department of Special Operations, came back, and then they met Ophelia Bulletova, the snake-scorpion beauty portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, under the spell of the fascinating tech billionaire Jake Lacy, the sinister Jason Volta, the British prime minister is in dire straits.
Englis and Bob began their funny partying trips: they pretended to be waiters and set a brilliant French restaurant on fire; they engaged in disorderly suicides on Volta's luxury yacht; and Englis triggered a pure state of anarchy while familiarizing themselves with Volta's interiors using virtual reality headphones.
All the suspenses were resolved in the end at once, so harmonious, so lively, but overall, but only stayed at the lower level of children's plays.
The overall assessment is only flat.
Like the other two films, I wondered: could the British film industry not give Robin Akinson a role that matched hiss?
The Labour Party has denied any plans to cut British wages beyond the four-week holiday period
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider implementing an aggressive plan whereby British workers work four days a week without wage cuts.
The Labour Party reportedly hopes that businesses will use savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to provide workers with more days of rest.
In this way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend a week, while the pay for bringing home stays unchanged.
News sources said the idea was "in line" with Labour's economic agenda and that the plan would be aimed at British workers.
The four-day plan was supported by the Union of Trade Unions of the United Kingdom (TUC), so that workers could benefit from the economic transformation.
"The results of the policy review are expected to be published by the end of the year," a senior Labour spokesman told The Times on Sunday.
"It's impossible to do this in one go, but the 'four-hour-on-three' system is in line with the Labour Party's goal of leaning in to workers' interests and the Labour Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party was not the first party to support this idea, and the Greens pledged during the 2017 elections to introduce a “four-hour-on-three” system.
However, the plan has not yet received the support of the entire Labour Party.
One Labour founder said, "The 'four-hour-on-three' system is not a party policy and Labour has not yet considered it.
At last week's Labour meeting, Shadow Minister John McDonnell gave a detailed account of his views on the socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the powers of "unrevealed directors" and "frauds" in utility companies.
McDonnell's plan also means that existing shareholders in the water company may not be able to reclaim all of their shares, as the Labour government may be "cutting" them for immoral behaviour.
He also confirmed plans to support workers on company boards and to create "inclusive ownership funds" that would give employees 10% of private-sector equity so that they could draw up annual dividends of up to £500.
Lynce Graham and John Kennedy on 60 Minutes admitted that the FBI's investigation into Cavanaugh would have an impact on their decision
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has forced the final vote on the Supreme Court’s nomination to be postponed for at least a week, and has raised questions about whether the FBI’s findings will shake Republican Senators’ support for Brett Kavanaugh.
On Saturday's 60 Minutes interview, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI's findings would affect their decisions.
The idea of Kennedy Begraham (from South Carolina) is more open-minded.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to attend the hearing, and I said, I've talked to Cavano.
I called him after the charges were made and asked him, 'Have you done anything?'
He is determined, firm, and clear.
However, Graham's vote seems to have been nailed to the nail.
"I've got a good idea for Bret Cavano's vote, and I won't change my mind," he said, even on the charge of poisoning firefighters.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what the truth is, but what I know is that Bret insists he didn't do it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford in the speech.
"Everyone she says cannot verify whether what she says is true.
It's been 36 years.
Nothing can change.
What is Global Civic Music Festival and what contribution has it made to poverty reduction?
The Global Citizens' Music Festival, an annual music festival, will be held in New York City on Saturday with a very impressive star cast and an equally impressive mission: to eradicate world poverty.
This year, the 17th Global Civic Music Festival will attract thousands of people to the central park’s lawns to watch performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes and others, raising awareness of the event’s true goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Poverty Project is an international advocacy organization that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), the audience must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling or helping raise awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty in any other meaningful way.
But if the goal is achieved in just 12 years, will Global Citizen succeed?
Can the use of a free concert as a reward persuade people to take action, or is it just another term for so-called "net click activism" (people feel that they are doing something by signing online petitions or sending out promotions)?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has recorded over 1,900,000 “actions” from supporters to help achieve many different goals.
Global Citizen says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to issue commitments and policies worth more than $370 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 22.5 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the organization commended 390 commitments and announcements in its actions, of which at least $100 billion had been paid or raised.
The organization expects that the funds raised so far will have a direct impact on nearly 6.49 billion people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments included The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between British investors and practitioners dedicated to “helping children develop to their full potential” and, after receiving more than 4,700 citations from global citizens, a commitment to provide $3,500 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition.
At a concert in London in April 2018, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tacey Ullman said, "With the support of the British government, donors, governments and many global citizens like you, malnutrition is about to become a footnote in history."
The organization also said that the Government had announced the establishment of the Power of Nutrition project, which would provide nutritional interventions for 500,000 women and children, after more than 5,000 calls for action by the British Government to improve the nutritional status of mothers and children.
In response to a common question on the website, "What do you think we can do to eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will even fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will surely succeed, because our unity will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at the concert, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The interior minister said the U.S. would launch a naval "blockade" to stop Russian energy exports
According to the Washington Observer, U.S. Secretary of State for Home Affairs Ryan Zinke said Washington could "if necessary" deploy a navy to stop Russian energy shocks to markets including the Middle East.
Tsuki claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – especially those undertaken at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government – are a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think that the Russians are interfering in the Middle East because they want to repeat their practices in Eastern Europe and act as energy agents in the southern hemisphere of Europe," it was reported.
According to officials, there are many ways and means of solving the problem.
"The United States has the capability," he said, "to bring our navy together to ensure the smooth flow of maritime traffic and, if necessary, to put a blockade in place to ensure that Russian energy does not enter the market."
The Consumer Energy Alliance (Consumer Energy Alliance) is a non-profit organization that claims to be "the spokesman for energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that the two are actually the same.
"The economic choices of Iran and Russia are more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, adding that Russia is a "black horse" that depends on fossil fuels economically.
The statement was made because the Trump administration has been committed to pushing LNG exports to Europe to replace Russia’s status as cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have sought to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “untimely” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a “monopoly market” for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $110 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is a purely economic project aimed at doubling the existing pipeline capacity to 11 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely economic and unfair competition.
In September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow, said, "I believe we all recognise that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose suppliers."
The U.S. position was strongly opposed by Germany, which had reaffirmed its willingness to join the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "If a third country interferes in our energy supply, we will face great trouble.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider seriously" the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential election after the midterm election.
During her tenure at the Holly York City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
According to the Congressional Mountains, Warren said "it's time for women to move into Washington politics with a broken government that we're supporting, and one of which needs a top woman."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the presidential election.
Referring to President Donald Trump during his inauguration, Warren said, "He is taking our country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about the measures Donald Trump is taking against democracy,” Warren said.
Warren was blunt in his accusations against Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before the vote we need an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
However, polls released Thursday showed that most of Warren's own voters did not think she should run in the 2020 elections.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters “maybe” that senators should not be elected.
Thirty-two percent of voters supported him.
Polls show that the majority of voters supported former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting him and 48% opposing him.
Other notable high-profile Democrats likely to participate in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to U.S. News Agency, Byrd said he would formally decide whether to run in January.
Sarah Palin at a presidential rally accused Track Palin of having post-traumatic stress disorder
Track Palin, 26, joined the Army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence
"My son's feelings, the feelings he experienced when he came back, and the belief that other soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder or injured soldier families can feel the same," she told the audience at the Donald Trump Show in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his capture as "the elephant in the room" (indicating the obvious and neglected facts), and said that her son and other veterans "when they came back, people changed, and they wondered whether they had equal respect for their motherland as soldiers, pilots and all the other members of the army."
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and carrying weapons against a woman after being drunk.
The U.S. challenged new asylum policies, 18 states and the District of Columbia backed
18 states in the United States and the District of Columbia supported a legal challenge to a new policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia presented a court-friend briefing to Washington on Friday, supporting a person seeking asylum challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full names of the plaintiffs have not been disclosed in the American Civil Liberties Union's August lawsuit against federal policy in Grace v. Sessions.
Grace claimed to have been abused by her partner "and his son, a member of the violent gang", but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers in support of Grace stated that countries such as El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala faced a widespread problem of gangs and domestic violence, which resulted in a large number of asylum-seekers applying for US asylum.
The U.S.’s new asylum policy overturned the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals to allow illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District Justice Minister Karl Racine said the new policy "has ignored decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the ban violates the above principles," the court's friend said in a briefing.
In the brief, lawyers further argued that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter the United States was damaging to the economy, making them more likely to become entrepreneurs and "providing the necessary labor".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered that immigration judges no longer provide shelter to victims of family and gang violence.
In announcing the policy on 11 June, Seychelles stated that "persons who have been persecuted or feared for their race, religion, nationality or membership or political views of a social group and who have left their country can be granted asylum".
Asylum is never intended to alleviate all the problems faced by people around the world on a daily basis, even if they are serious.
With the death toll doubling, Baru's desperate rescuers struggled for seconds to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"I feel very nervous," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is relieving her severely injured son from fever at an evacuation centre in the city of Baru.
"The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, carefully searching for the buried objects, trying to rescue anything they could find.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake left hundreds injured, and hospitals were destroyed and flooded.
Several injured people, including Drwi Haris, who was injured in the back and shoulders, were resting outside the Palau's Army Hospital, where patients had to be treated outside due to intense aftershocks.
Harry's eyes were filled with tears when he remembered the tremors in the fifth floor room of the hotel, where he and his wife and daughter lived.
"We have no time to save ourselves.
I think I've been pushed into the rubble of the walls," Harris told U.S. reporters, adding that their family was attending a wedding in town.
"I heard my wife cry for life, but then there was no voice.
I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they can be safe.
US Ambassador to China accuses China of "fraud" in "political advertising"
A week ago, a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily, denying the mutual benefits of trade between China and the United States, and the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media for political propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's pay-for-the-post report in The Times, the largest-selling newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, which China later denied.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempts to interfere in the US elections marks a new stage in what US officials have said to Reuters, as Washington’s pressure on China escalates.
Although foreign governments often advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in the midst of an escalating trade war, with the two countries imposing several rounds of tariffs on each other’s imports.
Chinese experts say that in the early days of the trade war, China’s retaliation tariffs were aimed at attacking Republican exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China, former state governor of Iowa and major exporter of Chinese agricultural products, said Beijing's actions hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a commentary published in Sunday's De Mayan Journal, Brandt wrote that China is "increasing the intensity of deception through political advertising in our own free media".
"In terms of political propaganda, the Chinese government is using the traditions of freedom of speech and freedom of the press that the United States holds dear, and is publishing paid advertisements in the Daily Telegraph," Brandstad wrote.
"In contrast, you rarely see the voices of opposition on the bookstore stands on the streets of Beijing, nor can you see the real reflection of the Chinese people's differing views on China's worrying economic development path, because the media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added, "China's most famous newspapers have even refused to publish his articles," but he did not specify which newspapers.
Analysts warn that Republican women's withdrawal before the middle will lead to Cavanaugh's defeat
Several Republican leaders have insisted on supporting and defending the Supreme Court's candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault charges, and analysts have warned that they will face strong opposition, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the incident were so high that most of the Republicans recorded in the case had indicated they wanted to get rid of the vote.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Reeher, a professor at the University of Shreveport's Macwell College, told The Hill that "there is no turning point in these things."
Lair said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona) would be sufficiently angry to calm voters' anger as he struggled to get to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in an emergency.
"Women will never forget what happened in the past - tomorrow cannot be forgotten, and the whole of November cannot be forgotten," Karen Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington Post.
According to MIC, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee have chosen to continue supporting Cavanaugh's nomination, leading to Friday morning demonstrations similar to those in the Senate corridor, with protesters shouting, "November is here!"
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news website that "the enthusiasm and optimism for democracy are on the rise."
"People say that the enthusiasm is already very high; it's true.
But the enthusiasm is even higher, especially among women and young voters (18-29 years old) in the suburbs who usually don't vote when they don't like the president."
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts warned that strong opposition would arise if the Republicans continued to campaign.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said, "This will bring chaos to the Old Party (GOP).
Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an organization that helps Democrats in their elections, told the news channel, "It's not just about the votes in the committee or the final votes, or whether Cavanaugh will be replaced, it's about the way Republicans deal with this issue and the way they treat the victims."
However, as Ford’s and Cavanaugh’s testimony came to light, there appeared to be some disagreement among the American public over who should be trusted, and a slight inclination toward the latter.
According to the latest poll conducted by YouGov, 41 per cent of respondents were clear or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they were clear or likely to believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Cavanaugh may or may not have lied, while only 30 percent said they believed Ford may or may not have lied.
According to The Guardian, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, under Frank's auspices.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavano raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court candidate of having naked her genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web plan to create a new Internet that rivals Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Burns-Lee, is launching a startup company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the latest in the field of science and technology, is a company based on Burns-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data, and which people access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Burns-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was to “rule the world.”
Speaking of the startup, he said, "We have to act now.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, it can be used simultaneously in the same browser.
The unique characteristics of personal online data storage are that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this characteristic "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's chief executive, John Bruce, the intent of Inrupt is to help the company introduce resources, processes, and appropriate skills so that everyone can use Solid.
The company currently includes Burns-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of dedicated developers and a volunteer community of programmers.
Beginning this week, tech developers around the world will use tools available on the Inrupt website to create their own decentralized applications.
Burns-Lee says he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to make a radical change in all of their business models overnight.
"We're not getting their permission.
In an ad published on Medium on Saturday, Burns-Lee wrote, "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems, thereby helping to protect the quality and integrity of a new network based on Solid."
In 1994, Burns-Lee founded the World Wide Web Alliance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thereby changing the Internet.
In recent months, Burns-Lee has become the centerpiece of network neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Burns-Lee was the founder and director of the World Wide Web Alliance, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next generation of networks," Burns-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Recipients of the Victorian Cross of World War I
During the First World War, the only Anglican clergyman to have received the Victorian Cross during the war, celebrated in his hometown every 100 years.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so no one knew that he had won the highest military honour in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled the monument during a march in Lashden, Northampton County.
His grandson, Michael Vann, said the monument was a "glorious symbol" to commemorate his grandfather who had been awarded the medal for 100 years.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led the army across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the thick fog, in the rain of gunfire and machine guns".
He then rushed to the front line, led by "the brave" front-line fighters to the front, then struck down three small battalions with single-handed field artillery.
On 4 October 1918, a month and a half before the end of the war, Colt Vann was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, described his grandfather's behavior as, "I'm aware that his bravery will never make me any better, but it will keep me humble."
At the end of the march, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, presented a flower ring.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honored to participate in the march" and then added that "the true hero can be seen in the support given to him by all."
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206 to become Pig Peach
Imagine you're up all night waiting for the Bellator 206 game and you're told you can't watch the main game.
There are 13 matches in San Jose, 6 of which are main matches. The UK's 5th channel broadcasts the match live all night long.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the channel's content was changed to Pig Peach, and the British audience was shocked.
Some people stayed up all night, waited until the morning, especially to watch the boxing match, but fell out of sight.
On Twitter, a fan said that turning the show into an animated film was a "sweet joke."
Dave Schwartz, senior marketing and communications vice president at Bellator, said when asked about the program's broadcasting, "The government has ruled that it is not allowed to air this kind of program at 6 a.m., so the television station is forced to switch to children's programs."
"The Pig Peach," right.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said future arrangements would include the British audience as much as possible.
"I think the problem can be solved when considering re-runs," Coker said.
"But it was a British Sunday at six o'clock in the morning, but we could only wait for the Sunday on our side and broadcast it again, which was a British Monday.
But we're still thinking of a solution.
Believe me, after the program changed, I got a lot of information, and it was all unfriendly.
We were thinking of a solution at the time. We thought it was a technical failure.
But it's not. It's a matter of government control.
I can assure you it won't happen again.
We'll control for five games instead of six, usually we'll play five games, and we'd like fans to enjoy more, but it's too long.
The situation is a little embarrassing.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley
Olympic diver Tom Daley says his sexual orientation made him feel ashamed when he was a kid, and that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he found out when he got to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Lauren Laverne, on Channel 4's Desert Island Discs, said she talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after having a child, he had little to do with the Olympic championship.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the program, has been on leave for several months due to illness.
As Laverne's first guest on the show, Daley said he felt "low on the list" in his own growth because "the society doesn't accept homosexuality between boys and girls."
"Until today," he said, "I still have a deep sense of inferiority and otherness, and that's what gave me the strength to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove that he had "done something" so that people would not be disappointed when they knew their sexual orientation.
Daley, who has won two Olympic bronze medals, has now become a prominent LGBT activist, and will appear at this year's Australian Commonwealth Games to call for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He said he dared to speak out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he had met American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black in 2013 when he found out he was in love with the man.
Last year, Daley married the elderly 20-year-old Oscar winner himself, saying the age gap was never a problem.
Daley joined the Olympics for the first time that year at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer, he said, "I've experienced so much at such a young age, and it's hard to find anyone with similar life swings in the same age group."
The couple had their own son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, after which Daley's "common point of view" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd say 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there's something more important than the Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
He gave his son the same name as his father, Robert, in memory of his father, who died in 2011 of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daley said his father did not believe he would die, and his last question was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'Daddy, you can't sit in the front row,' he said.
"When he stopped breathing, I was holding his hand, and in fact, until he stopped breathing and was dead, I admitted that he would never fall," he said.
In the second year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics, winning a bronze medal.
"I just knew that's what I've been dreaming of all my life, diving in front of home-grown audiences during the Olympics, and there was no better feeling," he said.
And that's why Proud by Heather Small became his favorite song, he loved it during the Olympics preparations, and now, when he hears it, he'll be one of them.
Desert Island Discs airs from 11:15 a.m. (BST) to 4:00 p.m. on BBC Radio.
Missing player Michaelson was traded to Leeds on Saturday
American player Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Leeds Cup game on Sunday, but he must adjust to avoid a negative milestone.
Michaelson, the 12th player to participate in the two-year-old event, was replaced on Saturday by captain Jim Furyk in the four-four and four-two games.
The five-time top-scorer not only didn't become the center of the game as in the United States, but spent a day at the Lara team and training ground, hoping to fix his problems as soon as possible and return to the field.
Even at the peak of his career, with the straightest golf pole, the tense Le Golf National is not suitable for the 48-year-old, where the uneven course makes it harder to shoot away from the track.
If the court itself is not sufficiently prestigious, McClellan will be in Sunday's ninth game against precision British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all of Thursday's matches in partnership with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the U.S. team starts a 12-game singles game with a four-point loss, Michaelson's game will be crucial to a good start.
Forrick expressed confidence in his players, but he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood the role he was playing today. He patted me on the back and hugged me with his arms and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Forrick.
"He is very confident in himself.
He's a member of the Hall of Famer, and he's done a lot for the team in the past, as he did this week.
I probably don't expect him to play two games.
I wish he'd played more games, but that's the result and I have to accept it.
Like everyone else, he wants to be big on the field.
On Sunday, McClellan will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Leed Cup appearances.
This may mark the end of Leeds' career, but his personal record has never reached that height.
Michaelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 assists, despite saying that his appearance brought some intangible strength to the team.
"He's funny, sharp, funny, likes to laugh at people, and he's a great guy on the team," he explained.
"I think young players like playing with him, and this week it's going to be interesting.
Besides the game, he brought us a lot."
European captain Thomas Bjorn realised that the big lead was about to be lost
Europe's captain, Thomas Bjorn, judged from experience that a strong lead in the singles finals of the Leeds Cup could easily create a disadvantage.
Dean made his first appearance in the 1997 game at Valderama, where Steve Ballesteros led the team five points ahead of the United States, but ended up winning only 141⁄2-131⁄2 with an extremely weak margin.
After watching two matches of 2018 at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday (winning 5-3 and finishing 10-6 respectively), Beyoncé described it as: "You have to remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama and in Brooklyn; although we lost in Brooklyn, we had a risky victory in Valderama."
History will tell me and every member that it's not all over.
You must do your best before tomorrow comes.
Go out and do the right thing.
It didn't end until the scores were on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, which is also our focus.
I've been saying I'm concerned about the 12 players on our team, but we're very clear about what we're going to face - the most powerful player in the world."
"In this respect, I can never defeat myself," he added, adding that he was satisfied with the difficulty players faced on the golf course.
Tomorrow will be another evil war.
Tomorrow will be a personal show of self-sacrifice, a little different from the usual.
If the game progresses smoothly, it will be great to fight alongside your partner, but if you struggle alone, as a golfer, your overall ability will be tested.
That's the message you need to get to the players to understand, and to make the most of their individual abilities tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner, and your partner has to leave you, so that they can take full advantage of their abilities.
Unlike Beyoncé, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expected the team's individual performance to outperform that of his teammates, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
As the European team struggled to achieve the "Miracle at Medinah" ended in failure, and as one of the Bruckleen winners, Forrick was already at both ends of the final turning point and could have lost.
When asked how Ben Crenshaw (the then captain in 1999) encouraged the team to prepare for the finals, he replied, "I remember every damn word."
"Tomorrow we will have 12 important matches, but you might imagine a first-team player like Valderrama and Brooklyn.
If everyone moves in the same direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle match.
"So we've adjusted our squad to play in a way that's good for us, and everyone knows we're trying to create miracles tomorrow.
Thomas was in charge of the team's counter-attack, where he would face Rory McIlroy in the finals, followed by European players Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter in the semi-finals.
Speaking of the singles game, Billion said, "I deployed players in this order, and it was a decision that was made after all the considerations."
New German warships delayed again
According to local media reports, the German Navy's newest defense ship was supposed to be tested in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but due to system failures and cost-rolling balloon growth, we will not be able to see the defense ship appear until next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, a spokesman for the army said that the deployment of the new Baden-Württemberg-class cruiser, the main ship, the Rhineland-Palatinate, had been delayed until the first half of 2019.
The escort was supposed to serve in the Navy in 2014, but painful post-production problems have consistently plagued the fate of the vast project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class escort ships recalled in 2007 will replace the old Baden-Württemberg-class escort ships.
It is understood that the convoy will have a powerful firepower, a large number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some invisible technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – deployment of the newest guard ships for two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the most advanced warships – which are said to allow Germany to deploy forces overseas – will be out of date when they are put into service.
As early as last year, when the German Navy formally refused to test the convoy and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the fateful F125 convoy became the focus of news.
This was the first time the navy returned ships to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the withdrawal, but German media cited some key "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless in carrying out operational tasks.
Because the Baden-Württemberg-class escort would be manned by 120 sailors and would require half the manpower of the old Baden-Württemberg-class escort, software defects would be particularly fatal.
Similarly, it was revealed that the escort would be severely overloaded, which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to weigh twice as much as the same class of protective ships used in Germany during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project as a whole, including the training of the crew, has also become a headache.
Costs are said to have reached a staggering €31 billion ($3.6 billion), compared to the initial budget of only €22 billion.
Given the recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking, the problems faced by the latest escort ships have become even more serious.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliamentary defense committee, admitted that the German Navy had virtually “no more deployable ships.”
The official said that as time went on, the problem became more and more serious, with the old ships gradually decommissioned, but no new ships could be replaced.
He mourned that no Baden-Württemberg-class escort could serve in the Navy.
National Trusts Steal the Secret Life of Bats
A new study is underway at a farm on the Scottish Highlands to find out how bats use the land for hunting.
The research hopes that this discovery will reveal the behavioral veil of this unique flying mammal and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will track common whistles and vowel whistles as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats at Wester Ross' Inverewe Gardens.
They will install special tape recorders around key locations in the garden to track bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will use handheld detectors to conduct mobile surveys.
Then perform a professional voice analysis of all the recordings to determine the frequency of bats screaming and what bats are doing.
We then create habitat maps and reports to generate detailed visual images of bat behavior.
Rob Dewar, NHS natural conservation adviser, hopes the findings will reveal which habitats are critical for bats and how each bat uses them.
These information will help judge the benefits of habitat management, such as laying grass and how best to maintain forests where bats and other related species live.
But the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the past century.
The construction and development work has created enormous threats to bats, affecting their habitats and even causing them to lose their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting, the chemical treatment of flie paper and some building materials, and attacks by pet cats all pose risks to bats.
Bats are actually visible.
However, due to the habit of night hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They are able to accurately locate insects and obstacles in flight paths using complex reverse-sound positioning technology.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in Scotland, takes bats very seriously.
NTS has ten experts who have survived the First World War, and they regularly conduct surveys, habitat testing, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even established the first and only specialized bat sanctuary in Scotland at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight bats (10 in total).
The managing director, David Thompson, described the estate as the ideal habitat for bats.
"At Threave Estate, we created an area dedicated to bats," Thompson said.
"There are old buildings, broken old trees and all the excellent habitats here.
But there's still a lot of unknown about bats, so the work we do here and at other estates will help us understand more about how bats can thrive.
Thompson emphasized the need to check for bats prior to maintenance of the estate, because if a female bat's habitat is destroyed without knowledge, it could cause the death of up to 400 female bats and bat pups, leading to the total extinction of the local species.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, attack, harass or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to contribute their own strength.
"We have a lot of knowledge to learn about bats and many other species where we don't know the specifics of their populations," she said.
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers prepare to sue German magazines
Christiano Ronaldo, nicknamed "fake news" for his alleged rape, said people wanted to use him to "drain himself".
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Mirror Weekly for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus frontman was accused of raping American woman Katherine Mayorga in a 2009 room at a Las Vegas hotel.
According to Mirror Weekly on Friday, Ronaldo was charged with paying the woman $375,000 after the incident, leaving her to remain silent on the case.
Hours after the allegations were exposed, Ronaldo, 33, posted a live video on Instagram to 1,442 million viewers, accusing them of "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no,
What they're saying today is false news," said the five-time gold medalist face-to-face.
"They just want to use my name for their own purposes.
It's normal.
They want to use my name, but it's also part of their job.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine," added Ronaldo, laughing.
Reuters reported that Ronaldo's lawyers were preparing to prosecute Mirror Weekly over the allegations, saying their "unlicensed reports were suspected of violating personal privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would seek compensation "for the amount of mental damage corresponding to the severity of the offence, which may be the most serious human rights violation in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents from the local court in Clark County, Nevada, Ronald and Majorca were reported to have returned to the player's room after meeting at a nightclub where the rape took place.
Marjolla said Ronaldo knelt down after claiming that the incident had occurred to tell her that he was a "99%" gentleman when he claimed to be, and is now being dragged down by the "1%".
The document states that Ronaldo admitted to having sex with both men, but that both men were willing to do so.
Marjorie also said that she went to the police station and took photographs of herself injured in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearing retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
Marjolla, 34, says she is seeking an out-of-court settlement as she continues to suffer psychological trauma due to the alleged impact of the incidents.
When the case was alleged, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from United, and this summer Ronaldo had joined the Italian club Juventus for a €100 million fee.
Departure from Europe: Britain's loss of car manufacturers "will be its eternal regret"
Reg Clark, the UK's Commerce Minister, said that losing its position as a global leader in automotive manufacturing would be "his eternal regret".
He added that the British factory told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnston plant near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the UK would leave the EU without an agreement, and the border delays could lead to job losses.
The Burnston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, our factories will stop producing,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Burntiston Factory, a subsidiary of Toyota.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar, also voiced concerns about what would happen if no agreement was reached on cross-border trade operations after Britain's departure from Europe.
For example, BMW said it would close a mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Britain's Brexit.
The main concern for car manufacturers is that there may be supply chain risks to leaving the EU without an agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on a "timely" basis, receiving car orders from UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, Britain's borders could be interrupted, industry says, which could lead to delays and shortages of components.
The company said that Toyota's factory in Derby County could not hold more than one day's inventory, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "can avoid border checks through accurate verification".
"We need to reach an agreement, and we hope to reach the most successful agreement that will both achieve the current success and allow us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC's 4's Today programme.
"Evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers shows that we need absolute capability to continue driving a series of significant supply chains that are effective.
Toyota has not said how long it will shut down, but in the long run, cost growth will weaken factory competitiveness and ultimately affect job opportunities.
Peter Bouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnston plant for 24 years and is now the joint convener of the plant, says his members are increasingly worried: "According to my experience, once I lose these jobs, I won't come back.

The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that the high-level meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for a week” as the storm of Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavano has not yet calmed.
Rosenstein is in charge of overseeing the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, and Robert Mueller’s Trump campaign has been accused of spying on Russia and of obstructing the President’s investigation into judicial justice.
Washington has been debating for months whether Trump would dismiss a deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed whether Paddy's eavesdropping recorded Trump's conversations, and whether it was possible to impeach the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House in a heated report that he was about to resign.
On Thursday, it was announced that he had met with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "unwilling" to fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the hearing in order to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Cavanaugh and a woman accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christina Bracy Ford, will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a week-long investigation into Cavanaugh and postpone the Senate’s full vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said, "Given all the other things that are going on in the Supreme Court, it could be delayed for a week, and the exact date has not been fixed, I think it could be this week."
But we'll see that day, and I'll keep the press informed about the progress."
Some reporters will counter: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sands said the lack of a press conference was not because she hated television reporters' "shame-mongering," although she said, "I will not oppose reports of their "shame-mongering."
She then said it would increase Trump’s direct contacts with the media.
"There are more questions than ever before," she said, not citing any evidence. "We've studied these figures," she said.
Sanders said there would still be a press conference, but "it would be much better to talk to me if the media had the chance to ask the president directly."
We've organized as many questions as we can, and we've done so many times over the last few weeks, and when people can talk directly to the President of the United States, we'll cancel the press conference.
Trump often sets up a question-and-answer session when leaving the White House or attending public meetings or press conferences with visiting politicians.
There are few independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have explained to us the reasons behind this, appearing without hesitation in front of a gathering of reporters and sometimes even acting strangely.
The Minister of Health has sent a message to EU staff members of the National Health Service System (NHS) in Scotland concerning Britain's departure
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU staff members of the National Health Service System (NHS) of Scotland expressing the country’s appreciation for them and expressing the hope that they would continue to stay in Scotland after Brexit.
Jane Freeman of the MSP sent a letter six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has pledged to pay the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its transferred public service sector.
In the letter, Friedman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on departure have been going on all summer, and a decision is expected this autumn.
But the British government is also stepping up preparations for a possible non-negotiated situation.
I know it must be a very uncomfortable time for you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I value the contributions of each staff member, regardless of your nationality.
The valuable experience and skills provided by our colleagues, both within and outside the EU, will strengthen and improve our health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland will always be your home, and we very much hope you will stay here.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Mike Organ of Tennessee reported that the Tennessee State Tigers defeated Vanderbilt Commodores 31–27 on Saturday, defeating Christian Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers, who suffered a head injury and underwent emergency surgery.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers, told reporters that Abercrombie was injured shortly before the end of the half.
"He ran to the boundary and then suddenly fell down," Reid said.
Trainees and medical personnel delivered oxygen to Abclonby on the side of the line, then lifted him onto a stretcher and brought him back for further assessment.
An official of the Tennessee State University Tigers revealed to WSMV News in Nashville, Tennessee, Chris Harris that AbcLonby had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added, "We have not yet determined the type/degree of injury," while Tennessee State University Tigers are trying to understand the exact time of injury.
Abercrombie was a second-year college red-shirt player, his first season at Tennessee State University after moving to Illinois.
Before retiring from the game on Saturday, he finished a total of 5 shovels, raising his season's total to 18 shovels.
A higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who buy in the UK
Under a new Conservative plan, the UK will impose a stamp duty on foreign buyers buying property in the UK, which will help address homelessness
The move would counter Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The collection of stamp duties is targeted at people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise £1.2 billion annually to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher printing tax when purchasing property in the UK and that the tax will be used to help homeless people.
The move, which also promises to provide more affordable housing and lock in high-income people, is seen as countering Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
Increased excise duties are targeted at individuals and companies in the UK who do not pay taxes, and the additional funds will be used to improve the government's handling of lodging problems.
In addition to the current excise duty, including the second housing package introduced two years ago and the hiring of houses, the additional charge could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise £1.2 billion annually.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London property buyers are non-British residents, raising prices that make it harder for first-time home buyers to buy.
Many of Britain's wealthy areas, especially London, have become ghost towns, because a large number of foreign buyers are not in Britain most of the time.
Just before the new policy was introduced, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in taxes on stamps to enable more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large building companies of maintaining high house prices by buying up land rather than using it, and urged Ms. May to give up quotas for affordable housing to address the UK's "housing shame".
Mr. Corbin's announcement of a series of housing reform proposals gained widespread attention, including rent controls and the end of "no fault" relocations.
He also hoped to give parliament greater powers to build new houses.
"I said last year that during my tenure as prime minister, I would restore the dreams of the British people and make life better for every new generation," she said.
This means repairing the broken housing market.
Britain will always welcome those who want to live, work and start a family here.
This is not true, however, for individuals who cannot live in the UK and for foreign companies, as it is for hard-working British residents in the difficulty of purchasing.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is too far-reaching, and the insult to lodging is still very real."
Jack Ross: My ultimate dream is to be a Scottish coach
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, said his "final ideal" would be to become the manager of Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old Scotlandman is trying to revive the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the league, 3 points behind the first.
After leading St Mirren back to the Scottish League last season, he moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat, that's all," Ross said of the BBC's Scottish Sports Sound programme.
"I grew up watching the Scottish team, and when I was a kid watching the game with my dad at Hampton, I always remembered that moment.
But it's only when I'm successful with the team that I get the chance.
Before Ross, managers for the Sunderlands included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid of having so many famous people at such a big club, and had previously rejected invitations from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
Whether I succeed now depends on whether I can lead the team back to the Premier League.
Because of the team's structure and facilities, it's definitely going to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but it's only when I lead the team back to the Premier League that I'm likely to feel like a success.
His coaching career has only just begun for three years, and Ross has been an assistant coach for some time at Denver and worked for the Reds for 15 months.
He then led Aro from the relegation to the third tier, and in the following season, led San Marino from the edge of the relegation to the championship.
Ross says he feels more comfortable with his careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, San Marino and Hamilton Academical.
Recalling his experience with the Arrows, he said, "This could be a real crossroads.
I really think I'm more fit to be a coach than to play football.
It sounds strange, because I'm doing well, and there's nothing wrong with this life, and there's a lot of fun.
But playing football can be difficult sometimes.
There's a lot to do every week.
I still feel the pressure to play, but as a coach, it feels good.
"I've always wanted to be a coach, and I've done it now, and it's the most comfortable day I've ever felt in my life.

The survey found that 5:30 p.m. on Saturday is the best time for a refreshing drink
During the summer heat, bars in Britain struggled to make a profit, and chain restaurants were under pressure.
Bar sales grew 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA, a commercial consulting firm, said: "The heat of the whole day, plus the overtime of the World Cup in England, made July the same as it was in June, when bar revenues grew by 2.8% during the month, and the restaurant was hit harder.
In June, restaurant transactions fell 1.8%, while in July they fell even more.
Bars dominated by liquor and beverages performed best, while restaurant turnover continued to decline year-on-year.
Bars dominated by meals were also affected by the heat, although relatively less so than restaurant operators.
People seem to be thinking of something to drink outside.
The bar industry as a whole saw a 6.6% increase in alcohol sales this month and a 3% drop in food sales.
"This trend has been continuing since the end of April," said Paul Newman, a leisure and hotel analyst.
Among the main factors influencing sales in the outgoing consumer market, the biggest factors are weather and important social activities or sporting events.
The continuing struggle of the catering industry is not surprising, as sales declined by 4.8% year-on-year, and more painful is the continuing exacerbated cost pressure.
For the restaurant-based operators, the impact of a long hot summer is a blizzard, and time will tell us whether the right weather in August can bring the necessary breathing time.
The entire bar and restaurant industry, including newly opened bars and restaurants, saw a 2.7% increase in total sales in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand promotion.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a British bar and restaurant industry watchdog, collected and analyzed performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £90 billion, setting a benchmark for the industry.
One-fifth of minors hide from their parents and use social media in secret
One-fifth of minors (under 11 years old) hide from parents and teachers and secretly use social media, the survey found
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the use of fake Insta pages
The news has raised concerns about the release of pornography
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to pay for their parents
One-fifth of minors (under the age of 11) hide from adults and use social media.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that the use of fake Insta (i.e., Instagram, a photo-sharing website) accounts has grown rapidly.
The news raised concerns about the release of pornography.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "purified" main account to pay for their parents, as well as other secret accounts.
A mother accidentally found a secret website for her 13-year-old daughter, where she found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape me".
The survey, conducted jointly by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference, HMC, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two accounts at the same time, with half admitting to having a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, explained: "It's really unsettling that so many young people are creating cyberspaces where they're hiding and parents and teachers aren't aware of it."
Eilidh Doyle will join the Scottish Athletics Committee as "the spokesman for athletes"
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Commission at the annual general meeting of government bodies.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, described the move as a great opportunity for field coaches to gain international experience.
"He has a reputation in the Scottish, British and world sports, and we believe that if he joins the committee, Scottish athletics will benefit enormously," Betty said.
"I'm willing to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I want to be able to make a real contribution to Scotland's sporting career and help provide guidance," Doyle said.
The American athlete, who won four Olympic gold medals, including the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, is a long-time guest commentator for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and was unable to walk after a brief stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says it depends on time whether or not I will recover and to what extent.
Full recovery and re-learning to walk is a tough task, but now I'm able to complete the agile training!
Thank you for your encouragement!
In an ad for a vacuum cleaner, the comparison of a mother to a cow is controversial among netizens
In an ad released by a vacuum cleaner company, mothers who are breastfeeding will be milked more often than cows who are breastfeeding, which has sparked controversy among netizens.
When Elvie, a consumer technology company, launched its new product, "the world's first wearable noiseless breast-feeder," it released a humorous music video-inspired advertisement that demonstrated the freedom this new type of breast-feeder brings to mothers.
Four real mothers danced in a cow barn full of dried grass, following the music, and some of the lyrics read: Yes, I fed myself, but you can't see my tail. Didn't you find my big milk, it was my breasts.
The next song is "Extract, extract, feed my little baby, extract, extract, grandma, my little princess."
But after the advertisement was posted on the company's Facebook page, it caused controversy online.
The video was viewed by 77,000 people and received hundreds of comments, with varying reactions from viewers, many of whom felt it was suspected of contempt for the dairy industry's "fear".
"It was a mistake to advertise the product with cows.
Cows, like us, need to be pregnant to give birth to milk, but the difference is that cows' babies are stolen a few days after giving birth," a netizen wrote.
The Elvie suction cup can be placed in the breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another netizen commented: "For mothers and babies, this is certainly a trauma.
Why would a mother be treated as a city cow in an ad for a vacuum cleaner, when she doesn't want her child to leave her home?
Another netizen added: "This ad is too unrealistic.
Others thought the ad was good, and one woman admitted she found the song "very funny".
"I think the idea is particularly novel.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The process of sucking milk makes me feel like a cow.
Advertisement is a bit overhead, but I think it's still good.
"This product is very new," wrote one of the netizens.
Another commenter said the funny ad was aimed at the need to feel like a mom who needs to suck milk (usually in the company or in the bathroom) like a cow.
There is no intention of praising or judging the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of mothers showed that they were dancing, and that they were wearing a vacuum cleaner in their chest.
The idea behind the advertising came from many women who claimed to be like cows while sucking milk.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner is completely silent, without wires or tubes, and can be perfectly placed inside the breast, allowing women to free their hands, hold babies, and even continue to suck while out.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and executive creative director (ECD), commented, "Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product worthy of a bold attempt.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers and cows, we hope to put the process of breastfeeding and its problems under the spotlight, and in an interesting and relevant way, to show that this new type of vacuum cleaner can give people an unparalleled sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's milk machine has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children was wearing the T-shirt designed by designer Marta Jakubowski, which she wore at the time.
Hundreds of mobile children moved quietly to a camping site on the Texas border
Despite relatively unchanged policy at border ports every month, the number of children on the move is still rising dramatically, partly due to the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies, which have made it harder for supporters to accommodate children.
It is said that most supporters are illegal immigrants themselves, fearing that standing up to adopt children could endanger their chances of staying in the United States.
In June, the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and their other adult family members had to submit their fingerprints, and that they would share their fingerprint information with the Immigration Bureau, raising the risk considerably.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for support to accompany children without adults.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of individuals who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal immigrants, most of whom are transnational criminals.
That's why we keep chasing these people," Albert said.
According to asylum workers, in order to resolve the problems of these children as quickly as possible, officials have introduced new provisions requiring that some of them appear in court within one month of their detention (instead of the 60 days prescribed previously).
Many children will not appear in person, but will appear in the form of video-telephone conferences to defend their legitimate identity to immigration judges.
Children who are deemed to be ineligible for relief will be promptly expelled.
Asylum staff and the system have reported in recent months that the longer children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to violence or attempts to flee.
The defence lawyers say the concerns are more serious in large facilities such as Tornillo, which are too large to ignore signs of child resistance.
They added that transferring children to tent towns without sufficient time to prepare emotionally and with enough time to say goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma many children have already suffered.
Syria orders the immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "occupation forces"
In a statement to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees as soon as possible, despite the eight years of war in Syria.
Meanwhile, Syria's deputy prime minister, Mahmoud Alim, said foreign troops "will be treated accordingly" for illegally entering Syrian territory on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the United Nations General Assembly.
Moualim insists that Syria’s “war on terror is about to end,” and that since 2011 the war has caused more than 360,000 deaths and millions of displaced persons.
He said the Damascus side would continue to "confront this sacrificial war until we clear Syrian territory" of all terrorist organizations and "all illegal foreign forces".
More than 2,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Syria, primarily responsible for training and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers stationed in the country.
On the refugee issue, Moualim said conditions allowed them to return, and condemned "some Western countries" and "the spread of irrational fear" forcing them to leave their homes.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate the return of refugees," he said.
"They are politicizing purely humanitarian issues."
The US and the EU have warned that they will not provide reconstruction assistance to Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
The United Nations (UN) diplomats said Russia and Turkey recently reached an agreement to establish a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib, creating an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented Russian-backed Syrian troops from launching a massive attack on provinces with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualim stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed the hope that military action would target militants, including militants from the Nusra Front, which was linked to al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
The United Nations Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the new committee, composed of government and opposition members, will convene its first meeting as soon as possible to draft the Syrian post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualim listed the conditions for the Syrian government's accession to the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "examination of the provisions of the current constitution", and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Re-election
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless impeachments and scandals terminate his presidency prematurely, as many free audiences would like.
There is no doubt that this will be the most dramatic end to the presidency in history!
But so far, no sign of aesthetic fatigue has appeared.
Since 2014, the U.S. cable news network (CNN) has seen more than a doubling of its primetime viewership to 10.5 million, while Microsoft’s National Broadcasting Company (MSNBC) has tripled to 11.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, the average viewership of Fox News's golden hour rose from 1.7 million four years ago to 2.4 million, while MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show held the top spot on cable television with an audience of up to 3.5 million viewers for the main nightly news.
"People are attracted like moths because we don't understand," said Neil Baer, producer of the ABC television series Designated Survivor, the cabinet minister who became president after an attack on the U.S. Capitol destroyed it.
A veteran comedian, Nell Scovell of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, maintains a different theory.
Scoville told me that she still remembered riding a taxi in Boston on the eve of the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, 'Because he can make me laugh.'
There is no lack of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike other television programs, whether the immigrant family finally reunites or the global economy is healthy, Washington’s narrative is likely to determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case.
And the podium is the luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
However, when you find yourself watching a panel of experts for six consecutive hours discussing the roots of the “deep background” used by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-haired jacket (the Washington Post calls it “the arrogance of thick clothing”) and the implications implicitly implied in his remarkable description of Trump’s (uh, skeleton), you find that this far exceeds the scope of knowledge of an ordinary citizen.
For me, I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
With regard to the Trump program's actor rotation and daily twists (the provocation against the NFL, Kim Jong-un's praise), Brent Montgomery, chairman of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," said, "something he's doing makes it feel like it's a reality show, and he's pouring stuff into you every night."

It was a sunny day this week when I met Fleess, who lived on the northern shore of Coahuila with an outdoor temperature of up to 80 degrees Celsius, but was hiding in his room watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.

Large cash injections into the fiercest mid-term congressional race for seats in the House
The redistribution of the congressional districts led to two incumbents competing for the same seat in the 17th congressional district of Pennsylvania, and it was not surprising that a large amount of cash flowed in continuously.
The recently redesignated suburban Pittsburgh constituency became the target for Democratic Senator Conor Lamb, who won another seat in a special election last spring.
Ram's rival is current Republican Senator Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the original 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old congressional constituency map was in favour of Republicans and constituted an unconstitutional act, and thus re-categorized the constituency.
The contest for new seats in the 17th constituency raised financial problems between the major party financial sectors, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).
In the March 18 special elections, which attracted widespread attention in Pennsylvania, Lamb risked a narrow victory and became a household name in Pennsylvania.
Previously, the seat had been secured by Republicans for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning in that constituency by 20 percentage points.
Political experts have created a little advantage for the Democratic Party.
The United States had contemplated punishing him for supporting China in El Salvador, but ultimately chose to give up
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing and had barely been blocked by Washington.
Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, then remained in Panama until his partner expelled the Trump administration's management team.
State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to "no longer recognise Taiwan's recent decision" to return the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But consider only sanctions against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $1.4 billion in US assistance in narcotics control, development, and economic support.
The formulation of punitive measures, including a reduction in economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be a severe blow to the Central American countries and their high unemployment and murder rates.
With internal meetings taking place, officials in North and Central America have postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a gathering similar to last year’s, which was seen as a major step forward in preventing immigration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior government officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, effectively ending the idea of punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address a meeting scheduled for mid-October, diplomats say, as a signal that government authorities are paying attention to the meeting.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without being obstructed or punished by Washington's latest harsh messages.
A White House spokesman in Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which the three US officials (including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on conditional anonymity) described.
An external analyst closely associated with the government and unwilling to reveal their names confirmed their claims.
Research history
The next one that needs to be addressed is the report by Robert Mueller, the special legal adviser, on Trump’s possible obstruction of judicial justice, which is now well documented in public records.
Miller is reportedly turning his attention to investigating whether Trump has engaged Russia in campaigning to attack our elections.
If Congress fails, Trump will face Congress’s blame, and when he prepares to run again, he may end up with a jury of colleagues.
There are many assumptions in this, and I don’t mean that Trump’s failure is inevitable – nor is his failure in Europe inevitable.
Everybody on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice, and these choices will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German military officers were preparing to launch a coup against Hitler, on the assumption that the Western world would resist Hitler in Munich and support Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the best chance of avoiding the years-long massacre that followed.
The process of history is always centered on these turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is either speeding up or slowing down.
Nowadays, Americans face several such turning points.
What if Trump fired Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Miller’s fate investigations?
Since last year’s report that Rosenstein suggested that the president be secretly recorded and questioned Trump’s suitability for the post, Rosenstein has been a hot-pot ants.
Rosenstein said the Times' statement was incorrect.
"What would be our response if the recently requested Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) did not conduct an in-depth or unfair investigation into Brett Kavanaug - or if the Supreme Court did not accept credible sexual assault and fraudulent testimony and believed it to be true?
First, will we vote in the midterm elections in favour of a parliament that will be Trump’s responsibility?
If the attempt fails, the Democrats will enter a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail, because I've learned the lesson from Bragg.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
She survived, then emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, my mother sent me to light a candle of peace on a table marked with Nazi markings.
How can I not be optimistic about our future with this inheritance?

Graham Dorrans of the Wanderers are optimistic about their match against the Vienna Rapids
On Thursday, the Wanderers faced the Vienna Rapids at home, who knew their victory at the Austrians' invitation would set them on a favourable footing in Group G of the European League when they faced Spain's Villarreal earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance in the season before the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believed the Wanderers could use it as a springboard to score better.
"It's a great opportunity for us because the Villarreals are strong," said Graham Dorrans, 31, who has been playing for the club for over a decade.
"Before the game started, we believed we would not come back to white, and eventually we won a point.
Maybe we shouldn't have stopped there, but it's finally settled down.
They did better in the first half, and we did better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European night.
I hope we'll get three, but it's going to be a tough game because they've done a good job in the last game, but there are so many people who support us, and I'm sure we can keep going and do good.
Last year was certainly a very difficult one. There were many things that happened after my injury, and the club itself had some changes, but now we feel good.
The team was good, the players enjoyed the game, and the training went well.
I hope we can continue to move forward and overcome the last season and achieve success.
Women insomnia due to fear of retirement savings
Although the survey participants were aware of what kind of care they wished to receive, few had talked to their families about it.
About half of the nationwide survey said they had discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% said they would have talked to their children about it.
"People all want to have a family to take care of themselves, but they don't try to communicate with their families," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationalwide Life Insurance.
See below for how to start.
Communicate with spouses and children: If you don't tell your family your intentions in advance, they won't be able to take care of you properly.
Work with your advisers and family to discuss the details of where to provide care and how to get care, as these choices are important factors in determining costs.
Get your financial advisers involved: your advisers can help you figure out how to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value mixed life insurance that can be used to pay for these expenses or to self-insure your wealth (as long as you have money).
Formulate legal documents: Avoid legal disputes at the point of contact.
Arrange a health care agent so that you can designate a trustworthy person to oversee your health care situation and ensure that the professional nursing staff can follow your wishes when you cannot communicate with them.
In addition, prepare a financial authorization.
You can choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions for you and ensure you get paid when you lose your ability.
Don't forget the small details: imagine an elderly parent with an emergency medical problem on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
In the written plan, list these details in detail so that you are ready.
"It doesn't just affect the finances. Who's the doctor," Martin asked.
"What medications do you take?
Who cares for patients?
Make these plans.

Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
The strong earthquake and tsunami in Bali, Indonesia on Friday, have killed at least 384 people, and the death toll is still rising, Indonesian officials said.
As communications were cut off, rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala County, north of Baru, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 quake.
In Bali, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Baru and Donggara on Sulawesi Island:
Balu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow and long bay off the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a county along the coastline of more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county is a sub-provincial administrative area with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic pillars of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mining industry also plays an important role in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali County, off the coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Baru and Donggara have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Calais.
In 1996, another tsunami hit western Donggara, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in an earthquake-prone Pacific volcanic zone and is often hit by earthquakes.
The following are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
On 26 December 2004, a massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh, northern Sumatra, Indonesia caused tsunamis in 14 countries/regions, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were residents of Aceh.
2005: Severe earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006 – A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the southern coast of Java, Indonesia's largest island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Badong, the capital city of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mindanao Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016 – A low-lying earthquake strikes Bijdjaya County in Aceh, causing severe damage, reminding people of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami, and causing extreme panic among the population.
The earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but the collapsed buildings also caused more than 100 deaths.
2018: A major earthquake struck Indonesia's tourist island of Longme, killing more than 500 people, most of whom were active in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of beating others.
A report on domestic violence and refusal to arrest, released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, said Perrin, 29, an Alaskan Vasilla, had been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
According to police reports, a female acquaintance tried to report her alleged crime to the police, and Pelin took her cell phone from her hands.
According to KTUU, Palin is currently in custody at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facilities and holds $500 worth of unsecured bonds.
He pleaded "not really guilty" when the court demanded his defence on Saturday, according to a network report.
Palin faces three counts of A minor offence, which means he could face a year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
At the same time, he was also charged with a category B minor offence and could be sentenced to one day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
It was not, however, the first time that Palin faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, a report on a crime involving domestic violence allegedly accused Pelin of domestic violence and of shooting after being drunk.
Palin's girlfriend claimed he hit her face with a fist.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was condemned by veterans’ organizations for allegedly linking her son’s violence to PTSD during her service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
Friday's earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi has killed at least 384 people.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, then triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks are paralyzed, and deaths are expected to continue to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake occurred in the central part of Sulawesi island in northeastern Jakarta, Indonesia.
On social media, the disaster situation video is overwhelming.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people were celebrating the holiday on a beach in the city of Palau.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Suspects
The U.S. Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York hopes to impose the death penalty on New York suspect Sayfullo Saipov. The terrorist attack, which resulted in the deaths of eight people, is a rare case in which New York City has dealt with such a crime since 1953.
In October, he was alleged to have driven a Home Depot rental truck on the West Side Highway in downtown Manhattan into a bicycle lane, crushing pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
According to a notice of intent to seek capital punishment filed by the Southern District of New York, in order to prove that capital punishment was reasonable, the prosecutor must prove that Sebov had "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" injured others.
According to the court's documentation, both crimes could be sentenced to death.
Several weeks after the attack, a grand jury in the U.S. stated that the suspect was charged with 22 counts, including eight murders, supporting bribery (a term used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases), and violently damaging motor vehicles.
The prosecutor stated that the attack required "a great deal of planning and planning", and described the way in which the Sevastopol attacks were described as "horrible and cruel".
The letter of intent stated that "Seymour Sapov has caused the victims Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's family and friends to suffer tremendous damage and losses".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last execution case in Southern New York has been pending for 10 years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution in the New York Federal Court was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of murder and executed for Soviet espionage during the Cold War two years ago.
On 19 June 1953, the Rosenberg couple were executed by electric chairs.
The court documents showed that Sipov was a Uzbek and had not shown any guilt in the days or months following the attacks.
Police said he told investigators he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Sipov told authorities that he initiated the attack after being inspired to watch ISIS videos on his mobile phone.
Police say he also demanded that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Sevastopol, said they were "especially disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek capital punishment and not to accept life imprisonment without parole will only prolong the trauma to all those involved," Barton said.
Sipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek capital punishment.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
In a protest at the Conservative Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to " mobilize the people's army of today".
The former leader of the Independence Party said that politicians must “feel the warmth of the ‘Eurosceptics’,” as one of Theresa May’s MPs said he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
In a demonstration in Birmingham, Conservative MP Peter Bone said that if Mr Farage were to become Brexit Secretary, Britain would be "departing already".
But the inclusion of the Left-wing Tory Party in a separate protest against Britain’s departure from the EU highlights the challenges Ms. May faces in reconciling a profound array of differences.
Under the clutches of de-Europeans, left-Europeans, and the EU, the prime minister is trying to adjust the Chequers plan to get it on track.
The ally insisted that, despite strong voices of opposition, she would continue to strive to reach an agreement with Brussels and force doubtful Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her plan and "confusion".
Mr. Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave gathering that he wanted to "get rid of the Chicks plan".
He said Mr Farage should be accompanied by himself to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he's responsible," he said, "we've already left Europe.
"I'm going to push Britain out of the EU, but we need to give up the Chicks plan," the Welsh MP added.
As he expressed his opposition to the EU, he said, "We don't need the world war to obey it.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
There was a suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, but Mr Bone rejected the suggestion: "It's not true to think that the British have changed their minds and want to stay."
Conservative exitist Andrea Jenkyns, who also participated in the rally, told reporters: "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
"The people don't welcome the Chicks plan, the opposition won't vote for it, neither do our party and our activists. Remember, these are the people who are cheering us on the streets, and they are the first to elect us to office.
Please give up the checks and listen to the voices.
In a message to Ms May, she added, "The prime minister can only keep his position if he keeps his promises."
Mr Farage told gathering politicians that if they were to betray the decision in the 2016 referendum, they had to “feel the heat of the voice.”
"Now," he said, "it's about trust between us, the people and the political class.
"They want to betray the Eurosceptics, and we say to them here today, 'We won't let you do that.'
In a speech to the enthusiastic audience, he added, "I hope you can make those who are planning to betray the leftist political class feel how high the rhetoric is.
"We will mobilize the British People's Army, which has contributed to our departure victory, and we will never rest until we achieve independence and self-government in Britain.
Meanwhile, the remaining troops marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the formation of the team this weekend, several activists waved the flag of the Conservative Party against departure from Europe.
At the opening of the conference, Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the security problems encountered by Conservative party applications.
"It's these people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technologies to achieve Canada++, friction-free borders, Irish free trade without borders," he added.
"It's a full-blown drama.
There is nothing as good as departure," he added.
Warren plans to "consider seriously" presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider seriously" running for president after the November election.
The Massachusetts Democrat Senator spoke about his plans for the future at a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday, the Boston Globe reported.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is currently running for the November election with Republican Senator Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation about a possible replacement for Trump in 2020.
The event, held on Saturday afternoon in Holly York City, was her 36th meeting since Trump took office in the form of a town hall rally.
One of the participants asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "to get women into Washington to repair the broken government, and one of them is a woman at the top."
Los Angeles State University (LSU) suspected of killing Sims arrested
The Louisiana Barton Rouge Police Department announced on Saturday that suspects in Friday's shooting of Wayne Sims, a basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), have been arrested.
At a press conference held at 11 a.m. Eastern time, the Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old suspect Dyteon Simpson.
Police released a shooting video Friday asking people to help identify the men in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday that "Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately killed".
Wade defended his friend before being shot by Simpson.
In the face of interrogation, Simpson confessed to being on the scene and holding weapons, as well as to shooting Wayde Sims.
Nonetheless, Simpson was arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge District Police Station.
Simons, a six-foot-six-inch boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, scoring 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes each, scoring 5.6 points, and scoring 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins Sebastian Vettel with the team's help
From the moment that Walteri Bottas defeated Lewis Hamilton on Saturday to qualify for the race, it is clear that Mercedes's "team instruction will play a big role in the race."
Starting from pole position, Potass led the way, nearly punching Hamilton in the first two rounds of defense, and attracting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vitter entered the maintenance station first, and Hamilton ran to the end of the team, which should have determined the end of the race.
One lap later, Mercedes came onto the track and was back on the track, behind Vettel, and after a counter-fight, the Ferrari driver (Vettel) unwillingly let out the inner track in order to avoid holding back after a double defence on the third bend, Hamilton regained the lead.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on the day, started in the back row of the track and finished seventh at the end of the first lap.
During most of the race, he raced at full speed, finishing faster than Kimi Raikkonen, finishing in fourth place.
He eventually entered the maintenance station in lap 44, failing to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps and finishing in fourth place.
"It's hard to get through today," Hamilton said, "because Watley's performance throughout the weekend was quite good and he gave me the position in a very gentle manner.
The team achieved the first and second results, which were excellent.
W: It's really awkward to speak a body language
President Donald Trump derided Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting that she had not leaked a letter about Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual assault on Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a speech at a gathering in West Virginia, Trump did not speak directly about the testimony provided by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what is happening in the Senate right now is a good demonstration of how "despicable, dirty, and hypocritical" people are.
Trump said, "When you see anger, when you see angry, mean, dirty, hypocritical people, something can happen, and good things are happening in the Senate in the last few days."
"When you learn of the release and leakage of the news, they say, "Oh, it's not me.
That's not what I did."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you leak the news?
Remember her answer ... did you leak the file - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
So, please wait.
Are we leaking ... No, not us," he added, recalling the senator.
In July, Vanstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Cavanaugh, which was leaked in early September – but Vanstein denied that her office had caused the leak.
According to the Congressional Mountain Report, Fanstein revealed to the committee that "I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose her experience."
"She asked me to keep the letters confidential, and I kept them confidential as she asked.
But her denial didn't seem to be accepted by the president, who commented at a rally on Saturday night: "Look, the body language is really bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, saying the Democrats were using the charges to their own ends.
According to Mediaite, the president said, "They will surely regain power by any necessary means.
You see those mean and dirty means, and they don't care who hurts, and they don't care who takes power and control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer wins two games against Dundee and wins the game for the Giants
On Saturday, Dundee Stars won the match 5-3 in the second round, making up for Friday's defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored, giving the Giants a two-point lead at the start of the game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie reached home level before Dwyer pulled the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
It was Adam Keefe's third loss in this season's elite league, defeating Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth time the two teams have met this season, and in the previous three games, Giants all won the match.
Dwyer started the opening with Kendall McFaull's 3:35 assist in the 4th minute, and with David Rutherford's assist, Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the tense opening match, Sullivan scored a home win at 13:10, followed by Matt Marquardt's 15:16 win over Cownie.
Dwyer scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first leg, allowing the Giants to lead in the first leg.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard launched a strong attack at 27:37 to bring the score to a new level.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the second half of the game, and scored the team's fifth goal in the last half of the game, thus securing the game's victory.
The Giants have lost four games in the past five and will play Milton Keynes at home in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers took their lives to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller lost his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people, and was later hailed as a hero.
On Friday, a massive earthquake in Sulawesi triggered a tsunami that killed more than 800 people and left more missing.
Severe aftershocks continued to swallow the area, and many people in the city of Baru were trapped in ruins.
But, despite colleagues fleeing, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job, and remained firmly in control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He insisted on staying on the ground to ensure that Basel Air Flight 6321, which was already on the runway, could take off safely.
When he realized the control tower was starting to collapse, he jumped off the tower.
He later died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, an Australian spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said Agong's decision saved hundreds of lives.
We have a helicopter ready to take Agong to major hospitals in other cities, flying from the Caribbean to Bali.
However, it is regrettable that Agong left this morning before helicopters reached Barau.
"We are very sad to hear this news," added Shiret.
Meanwhile, Indonesia's national disaster relief agency said roads to towns such as Donggala, Saiqi and Boutong were blocked, and government officials feared the death toll could reach thousands.
"We believe the death toll is still rising because many bodies are still buried under the rubble and many have not been found," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A wave of up to six meters destroyed Baru, where a mass funeral will take place on Saturday.
Military and commercial aircraft are constantly sending aid supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News reporters: "The ambulances deliver the bodies every minute.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
The nearby small market was looted.
Jan Gelfand, president of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don't know what the search and rescue team will find.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Bali on Sunday to address the Indonesian army, CNN reported: "I have ordered you to complete all the evacuation tasks day and night.
Are you ready?
Indonesia's Longme Island was hit by an earthquake earlier this year, killing over 550 people.
New Guinea Airlines (Air Niugini) says a man has disappeared after the plane crashed into a reef
A New Guinea Airlines plane crashed into a reef lake in Pacific Micronesia, claiming that 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the bottom of the plane and that a man was missing.
New Guinea Airlines said it was unable to explain the disappearance of male passengers at a press conference Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local governments, hospitals and investigators to find the whereabouts of missing men.
The airline did not immediately disclose the passenger's age, nationality and other identification information.
The plane crashed into the lake when it landed at Chuuk Island Airport, where local boats rescued other passengers and crew members.
On Friday, officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still being treated in hospital and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the sequence of events are unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed off the runway in the reef.
Some witnesses believed that the aircraft had run out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
Jaynes said, "It's good to fly low."
Jaynes explained that after the plane sank, the water in the aircraft was already deep enough to reach the emergency exit.
The crew, he explained, were terrified, shouting and screaming, and suffered minor injuries to their heads.
The U.S. Navy said sailors near the rebuilt dock participated in the rescue and drove a gas-filled boat to bring the landing crew to the shore, after which the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airliner crashes registered with Papua New Guinea State Airlines over the past two decades, but there are no passenger death records for New Guinea Airlines.
Analysts list the timetable for women who are burned alive in the evening
The Prosecutor's Office re-audited on Saturday on charges of a 2014 Mississippi woman suspect who was burned in a fire.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett, an expert in intelligence analysis, gave hours of testimony.
He introduced the jury to how he used his cell phone records to assemble 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers into the events of the case that night.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett explained that he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Triss was with him the night of Chandler's death, contrary to Triss' earlier statements.
Trice claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, and the data showed that Trice's cellphone was in the same position as that of Chandler's, so the police went to see Sanford to find out.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
The prosecutor asked Sandford if the facts were true, and said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction is that, says Triss, they had known each other for about two weeks at the time of Chambers' death.
And the phone records show that they had only known each other for a week.
At some point after Chandler's death, Trace deleted Chandler's text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his cell phone, Rowlett said.
Hale said, "He wiped her out of life and wiped her clean."
The defendant is scheduled to begin the final argument on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped to send the trial to the jury later that day.
High Breed hip hop: What is conscious hip hop?
The group hopes to inject positive messages into their songs and change people's negative attitudes towards hip-hop music.
High Breed, a hip-hop band from Bristol, said that hip-hop music was originally political and social in its songs, but has now moved away from that form.
They want to trace their origins and make conscious hip hop popular again.
The hip hop bands The Fugees and Common have recently re-emerged in the UK with performances by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
After receiving a message of "racial discrimination," a New York-based nanny sued the employer's couple in court
A New York nurse was fired after receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she was a "black again", and the couple filed a lawsuit against her for "racial discrimination".
The couple refused to acknowledge racial discrimination and called the case a "lease".
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment after discovering that she was black before childcare provider Giselle Maurice was posted.
"No, it's a black man," he wrote in a text message to his husband, Franksman.
However, the message was sent to Maurice twice wrongly.
The New York Post reported that Mrs. Franksman, feeling "awkward" after realizing that she was out of shape, dismissed Morris on the grounds that the upcoming African-American nanny was not doing well and she was waiting for a Filipino.
Mrs. Franksman paid Morris a day's wage, and then called a bus to take her home.
Morris is today suing the couple, demanding that they commit to a six-month temporary job in the employer's parents' home for the initial job and pay compensation of up to $350 a day, despite no contract.
Morris told the New York Post on Friday, "I want to tell them, look, you're not going to do that," adding, "I know that's racial discrimination."
The couple dismissed the allegations that they had no racial discrimination and that it was entirely reasonable to terminate Morris' employment, fearing they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean to send her some information.
She has no racial discrimination.
"We don't have racial discrimination," Joel Plasco, a husband, told the New York Post.
"But will you be relieved to give your child to someone you've offended, even if it's unintended?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, maybe nobody will.
Plasco called the case a "lease", saying that her wife had a child two months ago and that the situation was "very difficult".
"Will you hire someone like that
That's not a wise move," the investment banker added.
Although the case is still pending, public opinion courts have quickly begun to condemn the couple's behavior and logic on social media.
The latest letter reveals that Paddington Bear publisher fears readers will not be able to accept a talking bear
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by readers, said in the letter, "It was hard to imagine the feeling of the first reader before the book was published.
Now the Paddington Bear has achieved great success, and it's really funny.
Speaking of her father, who was a photographer for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and later inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, she added that his father died last year, marking the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, and that he was always hopeful of his many rejected works.
Speaking of the Paddington Bear, she said it was a "very important part of our family" and said her father was proud of his ultimate success.
"My father is a very quiet man who never boasts," she said.
But because the Paddington Bear is too real to him, it's like your children have achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not yours.
I think that's how he views the success of the Paddington Bear.
Although this was a crystallization of his creativity and imagination, he always attributed success to the Paddington Bear himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After the plane landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nad always called and said things were so bad that she didn't think it would happen," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter had only a few minutes left and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
I did it.
I said, "Dear Zacy, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll always be with you.
The medicine the doctor gave her to keep her heart pounding was gradually ineffective.
She died early, and everything was over.
Knowing that all this has happened, I can only sit there and wait.
I can't roar, scream or cry because my family and friends are all around me.
I have to stay calm.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was in the pain of her deceased daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, seemingly calmly oblivious to the hardships she was experiencing.
"Nobody can feel it," she said.
"I lowered my head and tears poured down unstoppably.
I know it's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I had the strongest sympathy for Nad.
He needs my understanding and care.
I know how much he loves his daughter.
A sorrowful woman puts up a card to persuade those who have light thoughts to turn their minds
Two women who had lost their loved ones tried to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been pasting cards on the bridge, with encouraging letters and telephone numbers, to help those in need get support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at the age of 13, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want another parent to experience the pain I suffer every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis lives in Lydney, 45, and her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile on his face.
"Everyone knows he's a laughter-loving man.
People always say that his laughter makes everyone in the room happy.
However, he gave up his job and soon died, and went to a "special dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's younger brother, who was only 11 years old at the time, discovered that Tyler had ended his life.
Davis said, "I've always been worried that his suicide would lead to a chain reaction.
So Davis produced the film, "I want people to know that someone is willing to help you, to listen to your voice, even if we're friends.
Don't be silent. You need to listen.
Mrs. Humphreys has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years. Shortly after her mother's death, her husband also left her.
"He never told us anything about feeling down or depressed or lonely," she explained.
Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that his mood was not right.
On Christmas Day, the children opened their gifts, and he didn't have much eye contact, or anything like that, and his mood had dropped to the bottom.
She said her husband's death left them with a lot of wounds, but they still had to live: "The whole house collapsed after he died.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) launched an investigation into the future of Brett Kavanaugh
"I think if we can really get what he wants - a time-limited, time-limited investigation - then maybe we can regain a little bit of unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would take this opportunity to "start dismantling" the deep-rooted party stalemate.
Why did Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing problem.
With only five weeks to go before the midterm election on November 6, the Republicans’ attempts to nominate a candidate for the US Supreme Court will be undermined if, as we expected, they do not perform well.
George W. Bush kept calling senators trying to lobby for their support for Cavanaugh, who had served in the White House for the Bush administration and had met his wife, Bush's private secretary Ashley, through Bush.
What will happen after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) releases its report?
The Senate will vote, with 51 Republican and 49 Democrat seats in the Senate.
It remains unclear whether Cavanaugh will win at least 50 votes in the Senate to break the stalemate with Vice President Mike Pence, thereby confirming the nomination of the Supreme Court candidate.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim Jong-un’s regime “decreases”
A South Korean legislator says the number of North Koreans who have fled to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago.
According to Park Byeong-seug, the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, a total of 1,127 North Koreans fled to South Korea last year, compared to a total of 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key reason for the decrease in the number of insurgents was the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in the cost of population smuggling.
North Korea has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Koreans who fled to South Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 Koreans have illegally crossed the border to Korea, South Korea said.
Most of the insurgents fled through China to North Korea, because North Korea has the longest boundary with China and is easier to cross than the defenceless zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers the insurgents to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea have improved dramatically in recent months, despite the fact that they are still at war from a technical point of view.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held talks in Pyongyang to start a dialogue on the deadlocked nuclear-free talks.
Improvements in bilateral relations resulted from a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, during which the two sides largely agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-hao accused the country of not making progress since the end of the meeting, as the United States is still imposing sanctions.
"If the United States is not trustworthy, we will not be able to ensure that our own security is guaranteed, so we absolutely cannot unilaterally disarm from nuclear weapons," Lee said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "chestrian" who is not fit to serve as a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House minority party, said that the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, "has a bad temper" and is not fit to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi said in an interview with the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman does this, they'll call her 'chestri'," Pelosi said, referring to a testimony given Thursday by Cavanaugh to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Cavanaugh felt out of control, and filed a complaint against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, claiming that he had not sexually assaulted Ford when he was younger.
Cavanaugh, in his opening remarks, was emotionally uncontrollable, and on several occasions he almost shouted and couldn't even say a word when discussing his family and high school life.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats who attended the meeting, claiming that the allegations were made by the Liberal Party in an "uncanny joint body-assault" organised because the Liberal Party was angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Cavano's testimony proved that he could not win the Supreme Court because it showed he had a bias towards the Democrats.
"I think his testimony and his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats show that he is not qualified," she said.
When asked whether he would impeach Cavanaugh if the Democratic Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
In other words, if what he says to Congress or the FBI is not true, he is not only unfit to serve in the Supreme Court, he is also unfit to serve in the court in which he is now," Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared Cavanaugh might rule against the Affordable Care Act or Roy v. Wade because he was a conservative judge.
Cavanaugh, in confirming the hearing, avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"Now it's not appropriate for a schizophrenic, biased man to be in the courtroom and we want to say, 'Isn't that good?'" said Pelosi.
Women need to exercise their powers.
It was a slander of justice, and months, even years, of anger were spreading, and she would not be able to escape without crying.
Steinem 45 years later said to me, "We cry when we're angry.
I think it's normal, don't you think?
She continued, "A woman who gave me a lot of help, she was the head of a company, and she said she would cry when she was angry, but she found a trick, which was that when she was angry and started to cry, she would tell the people she was talking to, and you would know that I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
Then she went on.
I think it's really great.
We use tears to express our anger, partly because we have fundamentally misunderstood our tears.
One of the things that struck me the most was in my early years at a company dominated by men, when I cried out of indescribable anger, and then I was caught in the back of my neck by an old woman (a cold-hearted manager I had always been a bit afraid of) who dragged me into the staircase.
She warned me never to let them see you cry.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad and happy because they've defeated you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, joined Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Hart retired from the race after being involved in a wedding affair on a ship named "Monkey Business Dinner", Schröder was depressed and thought that he himself should practice the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"At that time there were seven other candidates running, and they didn't really need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Little Dwarves.
As she was in the late stages of the campaign, Schröder was lagging behind in raising funds, so she vowed not to run unless she raised $200,000.
This is undoubtedly a losing battle.
She found that some supporters had donated $1,000 to the male candidate, but gave her only $250.
"Do they think I need a discount," Schrod doubted.
When she made the announcement that she would not launch a formal campaign, she began to choke with complex emotions – gratitude to supporters; disappointment with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters rather than representatives; and anger at gender discrimination.
Schröder recalled the media's reaction to her, saying, "You should think I'm psychotic."
"You might think of Kleenex as my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to engrave on my tombstone?
She's crying?
What benefits will the Sino-US trade war bring to Beijing
Professionals say the US-China trade war is raging and that, despite the fact that the war has only just begun, the differences between the two countries may be more beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump warned for the first time that China’s major exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum, were about to be taxed.
The trade war escalated sharply this week, with new tariffs imposing duties on half of China's imports to the United States, affecting commodities worth more than $20 billion (€15 billion).
Beijing has responded in the same way every time, with a recent 5% to 10% increase in tariffs on US goods worth $600 billion.
China has pledged to fight America to the end, and the world’s second-largest economy will never shrink in the short term.
Making concessions to Washington means meeting their demands, but it is far too embarrassing to openly surrender to the US to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nonetheless, experts say, if Beijing plays it right, the US trade war pressure could reduce the degree of interdependence between the two economies and bring long-term positive support to China.
Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher in Asia at the Center for New American Security, said, "If Washington or Beijing make quick political decisions, they could lead to economic chaos in both countries, which is actually more dangerous than previously accepted seat-and-seat arrangements."
Foreign Minister Says Syria "Ready" to Receive Refugees Back
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees to return voluntarily and calls on all parties to help rebuild their homes, which have suffered more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said at the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in Syria were improving.
"As progress has been made in the fight against terrorism, the ground is now more stable and secure," he said.
The Syrian government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists and restore them to normality.
At present, all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees are in place. Refugees who have fled because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods have been forced to flee their homes.
According to the United Nations estimates, more than 550,000 Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the 2011 war.
The remaining six million people in Syria still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomed other countries' assistance in rebuilding its ravaged homeland.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries involved in insurgent activities.
European team wins the Paris Red Cup
At Le Golf National in Paris, France, the European team defeated the United States by a score of 16.5 to 10.5.
The United States has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has never won a Leeds Cup in Europe since 1993.
Denmark's captain, Thomas Bjorn, took the lead in defeating the United States with 14.5 points, and Europe regained the title.
American star Phil Mickelson struggled for most of the game, losing directly to Francisco Molinari after hitting the third wicket in the 16th hole.
Italian golfer Molinari has been a big hit in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was defeated 5–4 by Torbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson, 2–1 behind England's Ian Poulter, is expected to take part in his last Leeds Cup match.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Leeds Cups and is a veteran, has become the most successful European player in history, scoring 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's too hard this year.
Thank you very much for choosing me, trusting me.
I'm glad. I'm glad I got the trophy back.
It's an honour for the whole team and I'm glad to be able to do my best," Garcia said excitedly after winning the European competition.
He relayed the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2–1 in Sunday's singles.
"I've been watching Tiger Woods since I was a kid, and I'm very proud to beat him," said Lam, 23.
Woods lost four games in France, scoring 13–21–3, the lowest record in the league.
For the greatest player in history, the statistics are strange, as he has won 14 major titles after only Jack Nicklaus.
In addition to Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who scored high-quality shots throughout the game, the US team was not upbeat all week.
American captain Jim Furyk, after his team's disappointing performance, said, "I'm proud of everyone, they're fighting hard.
We put a lot of pressure on Europe this morning for a while.
We're done.
To Thomas.
He was quite good as a captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll join the U.S. PGA and the Leeds Cup Committee, and we'll keep moving forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm very honored to be their captain.
We must pay tribute to them.
We were defeated."
Red tide update: Red tide density decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red tide density in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, water quality conditions in more waters such as Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier have improved, indicating a decline in red tide concentrations.
From the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County, a coastline of about 130 miles (210 km) was marked by red tidal waves.

Even as the US Navy is revitalizing its forces to deal with increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the US continues to focus on the Asia-Pacific region – the Pentagon expanding its scope to include the Indian Ocean, Asia, and the Pacific – according to British media, said Deputy Secretary of Naval Operations William Moran.
The United States has named China and Russia as strategic rivals in a new defense strategy it announced earlier this year, according to Jane's Defence Weekly on September 24.
The U.S. Navy then reinstated the Second Fleet in order to counter Russian activities more directly.
The moves have reportedly raised some doubts and concerns among allies and analysts, who fear that the US Navy may move away from the Obama administration's "Asia-Pacific rebalancing" strategy.
But he will say the U.S. Navy still focuses on the Western Pacific.
“No major changes have occurred for us,” he said at a round-table discussion entitled “Facing the Challenge of the High Seas,” hosted by the National Bureau of Asian Studies in Washington, DC, on January 24, 2018.
“The focus is still on rebalancing, shifting focus, or whatever you want to describe it,” said Moran.
He admitted, however, that the United States has close ties with Europe.
“We will continue to focus on growth on the West Coast and balance what we can do,” he said.
Although Moran points out that overall policy on Russia falls within the remit of the US Secretary of Defense, he warns: “The Russians may face demographic and economic challenges, but history shows that if we conflict with them, they will be very tough.”
As part of the US’s Eastern Mountain Restoration against Russia, China, and other competitors, the US Navy is dynamically deploying troops into a “new mode of operation,” which will help enable its opponents to anticipate where US carrier battlegroups or other assets will be deployed at any given time and location, he said.
“Our Navy and Marine Corps support it – the concept of unpredictable warfare, not appearing over and over again in the same place, almost like a haircut – that’s what we do,” he said.
Early deployments of the Carrier Fighter Group Harry Truman included work visits to ports and patrols in areas that normally only pass through, according to reports.
Moran said the U.S. Navy is currently working to ensure allies know that these ships will continue to patrol traditional areas, and is also addressing logistics and family contacts for new deployment procedures.
Royal Australian Navy Commander Michael Nunando also delivered a speech at the event, saying that the Australian army could work seamlessly with the American carrier battle group.
He said the situation would continue as the Royal Australian Navy plans to re-purchase nine escort ships equipped with the Zeus Shield combat system.
Several airlines will raise or restore fuel surcharges as of October 5th. There will be additional fares for flights from next Friday
Yesterday, airlines such as Xiangpeng Airlines and Oke Airlines announced that from October 5, 2018 (the date of departure), each passenger on domestic flights with a fuel surcharge of $20 per flight below 800 km (including) and each passenger on flights with a fuel surcharge of $30 per flight above 800 km will be charged a fuel surcharge.
As of October 5, 2018, starting at 0:00 p.m. (the date of departure), the fuel surcharge for domestic flights of 800 km (including) will rise from 10 yuan/person to 20 yuan/person, and the fuel surcharge for domestic flights of 800 km (including) will rise from 10 yuan/person to 30 yuan/person for each passenger.
Children and police remain at 10 yuan/person; infants continue to be exempted.
According to the airline's representative, the airline had indicated in the notice that the fuel surcharge would be charged on the original date of departure, and that the fuel surcharge would not be refunded or refunded when replacing the ticket.
This means that domestic flights booked before 5 October will not be subject to fuel surcharges under the new standards if they change to 5 October (inclusive).
Since June 5, 2018, several airlines such as National Airlines, Eastern Airlines, Sea Airways, Shanghai Airlines, Spring-Autumn Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Western Airlines, and Oakey Airlines have resumed to charge fuel surcharges on domestic flights for three years, with a standard charge of 10 yuan per person.
This time, Xiangpeng Airlines and Oke Airlines were the first to announce an increase in the fuel surcharge, and as of the press release, they did not see the announcement of the four domestic airlines to follow the adjustment.
It is also known that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Authority provides that airlines may decide on their own whether to charge fuel surcharges by November.
Boeing announced on September 27 that the fuel surcharge would be reintroduced from November 2.
The airline's website indicates that all airline tickets issued or re-issued on or after 2 November will include a fuel surcharge of 652 yuan for long-haul flights to Hong Kong and the Southwest Pacific, North America, Europe, the Middle East and India, and Africa, and 146 yuan for short-haul flights.
The cost applies to all types of tickets, calculated on the basis of each route, and includes the ticket quotation for all direct routes in KMT.
On the eve of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council of China met with the new ambassador to China from 29 countries and regions at the People's Assembly Hall on afternoon 30.
Li Keqiang shakes hands with all the ambassadors in China and talks with them.
Li Keqiang welcomed the delegates to China and asked them to convey their sincere greetings and best wishes to the leaders of the countries and peoples concerned and to the leaders of the institutions concerned.
Li Keqiang positively evaluated China's good relations with countries and regions, stressing that China is committed to enhancing bilateral political mutual trust, deepening pragmatic cooperation, and strengthening coordination and cooperation in international and regional affairs, and hopes to make more visits and visits, and to make a new positive contribution to the development of China's relations with their respective countries and regions in new posts.
The Chinese Government wishes to provide facilitation and support to the envoys.
Li Keqiang pointed out that China remains on the path of peaceful development and is firmly committed to promoting economic globalization.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening-up, and as the world's largest developing country, we wish to achieve joint development with other countries in the further expansion of openness.
Against the backdrop of the rise of protectionism and unilateralism, we would like to work together with the parties to continue to consolidate and strengthen partnerships based on the principles of mutual respect and equality and mutual benefit, to promote the development strategy for the next phase, to work together on the principle of sharing, to promote the construction of the Belt and Road Strategy and the Belt and Road Partnership, to work together to defend multilateralism and free trade, to build an open world economy, and to inject new impetus for the stable and balanced development of the world economy.
The delegation warmly congratulated the 69th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic of China, conveyed the greetings of the leaders of their respective countries and institutions to the Chinese leaders and people, and said that China's development achievements were remarkable and believed that further deepening reforms and expanding openness would bring more development opportunities to the world in the future.
We would like to play an active role in promoting friendly cooperation between our respective countries and regions with China and in achieving better mutual benefits and mutual gains.
Subsequently, the delegations and agencies in China attended the National Day reception at the invitation of Li Keqiang.
State Secretary and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the event.
Japan's Itochu Corporation pledged $1 trillion in depreciation losses on Friday for its investment in China's CBC stock, its largest corporate investment deal, due to trade tensions between China and the United States.
In May 2016, a man walked past the headquarters of Marubeni Corporation in Tokyo, Japan.
Marubeni says the trade war has hit the US grain sector, which has suspended financial transactions in the agricultural sector.
Previously, some Japanese heavy equipment manufacturers and telecommunications companies warned of the impact of trade frictions between the US and Japan when they published their latest results, and now these Japanese traders have joined the ranks.
With the US and China imposing tariffs on each other’s hundreds of billions of dollars in goods, US President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the scope of the tax to more than $50 billion in Chinese exports to the US if the dispute is not resolved.
Tsuyoshi Hachimura, chief financial officer of Ito忠, said the trade dispute could have a greater impact on China's economy next year.
In 2015, I藤忠商事 and the Thai Beech Group invested $100 billion in CBC and acquired a 20% stake in the company.
Hachimura said businessman Ito Tadasu had filed a loss of $1.433 billion ($1.3 billion) for the shares in this segment, believing that CBC shares would not rise again in the near future.
I藤忠商事(I藤忠商事) maintains a profit forecast of ¥5 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
China imposed a 25 per cent import tariff on American soybeans in July to counter China's trade friction.
“Our grain business has been hit by trade friction between the U.S. and China,” said Yanko Marubeni, chief financial officer.
He said he had stopped financial transactions in his own account since September.
Goldman Sachs spokesman Pat Burke said in a statement Friday that the company’s move was “in line with internal policy constraints and a lack of market opportunities.”
He also said the suspension of financial transactions would not lead to job losses.
Marubeni maintains an annual profit estimate of ¥23 billion, supported by pulp and papermaking and electricity generation operations.
On Thursday, Sumitomo announced a 16% increase in profits between April and September, stressing that “the US’s trade problems with China lead to uncertain prospects.”
Mitsubishi Corporation on Friday raised its annual profit estimate to record levels due to an increase in coal production and higher commodity prices such as oil and coal.
Mitsubishi Corporation also announced a new business plan, striving to raise profits from this year’s estimated $6.4 trillion to $9.8 trillion ($79.8 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.
The U.S. midterm election vote has come to a close.
On November 4, President Trump and his Democratic opponents actively “voted” to their core voters.
Both parties point out that voter turnout will be the key to the electoral situation.
It was reported that 48 hours before the U.S. public vote, Trump was busy attending the Republican rally, while former President Barack Obama went to Indiana to stand up for Democratic Federal Senate candidate Joe Donnelly, who was worried about the election, and call out to the public for a final appeal before the vote.
On November 4, Trump arrived in Mekong, Georgia, to stand for Republican presidential candidate Brian Kemp, and said, “You must go to the polling station on Tuesday, you must vote.”
“The contrast in this election cannot be clearer.”
The political enthusiasm of voters has risen to an unprecedented peak, and early voting in some states has gone far beyond normal.
A former U.S. president faces mid-term elections and his party's seats in Congress are often reduced.
The Republicans can benefit from economic assessments and Trump’s strict focus on border security, according to a new poll released by the Washington Post and ABC News on April 4, despite the Democrats’ still-dominating vote in the US House of Representatives.
Polls show that registered voters like the Democratic House candidate more than Republicans, 50 per cent to 43 per cent, but there is still a slight decline from the 14 per cent lead in August.
Another poll by the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) and the Wall Street Journal also showed Democrats still trailing Republicans by 7 percentage points.
"When people don't tell the truth, when words don't represent anything anymore, it's going to have bad consequences," Obama said to the public at Senator Donnolly's rally.
Democracy can’t work when people tell lies on their own.”
“The only way to stop these Republicans from acting now is with you and your vote.”
The Democrats faced the most difficult elections in decades in the Senate, with the Republicans now holding more than half of 51 seats.
But the elections in the House of Representatives were favourable, and the Democrats needed to win 23 more seats to control the 435-seat House of Representatives.
Analysts at five-thirty-eight.com predicted that the Democratic Party would win the House of Representatives by 85%.
Wang Yang attended and spoke at the important ideological seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political Committee of China.
The National People's Political and Decolonization Committee (CCPC) held an important ideological seminar on strengthening and improving the work of the People's Political and Decolonization Committee (PCC) in Beijing from 29 to 30 June.
The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP) and the Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP) Wang Yang attended the meeting and spoke.

Beijing, Nov 5 (China Time) - In the current wave of "people-to-people entrepreneurship, people-to-people innovation," more and more technology companies are starting to pay attention to patent R&D and related protection work, digging deep into the potential value of patents and occupying market dominance.
Similarly, many technology enterprises have encountered a small infringement wave in terms of patent technology authorization and use of patent technology.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, Ho Chhao Hong, and Li Bin from Guangdong Province filed a patent infringement lawsuit against the developers of the "Duck Travel" APP, Beijing Xiao Orange Technology Co., Ltd., the operator of the "Duck Travel" app, and the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Co., Ltd., at the Guangdong Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested that the court order the three defendants to cease immediately to manufacture, sell, promise to sell, and use the patents of the plaintiffs.
On October 30, 2018, the China Judicial Documentation Network published the “Civil Dispute Settlement of First Instance in Infringement of Invention Patent Rights Dispute between Mr. Tam Wei, Mr. Ho Ching Hong, etc., and Mr. Beijing Xiao Orange Technology Co., Ltd., etc.,” which revealed details of parts of the case involving the patent infringement of the drip travel app.
The three plaintiffs consider that the patent holder and inventor of the patent on the "system and method of car-sharing services based on mobile terminals" and the entire operational process of the application of the "swing-wheeler" in the "Dip-trip" APP are in line with the relevant patent protection technical schemes and constitute a patent infringement.
However, during the court's ruling, Xiao Orange Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an adequate defendant, and that it had provided free downloads of the relevant APP "Double Travel" on the Internet, had not implemented the relevant patent method, and that there was no direct or indirect infringement, and should not be classified as defendant in this case.
Secondly, the infringement in this case is not in Guangdong.
According to the legal provisions, the place of infringement of the patent concerned should be the place where the patent method concerned is fully implemented. Therefore, the court's jurisdiction has been challenged, requiring the case to be transferred to the defendant's domicile court, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangdong Intellectual Property Court found that defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the allegedly infringing doughnut travel APP products on its network platform, and the plaintiff listed defendant Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
The defendant's domicile in Guangdong Pacific is within the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The defendant claims to refer the case to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court and, on the basis of insufficient evidence, dismisses the objection raised by the defendant to the jurisdiction of the case and bears the costs for the admissibility of the case.
The other trials in the case have not yet been announced, and reporters will be closely watching the follow-up details of the patent infringement case.
The Chief Executive of the Federal Organization for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia: Significant results of Chinese-Australian scientific and technological cooperation
“China’s science and technology has developed rapidly over the past few decades, and the two countries can work together in the field of science to achieve spectacular results.”
Australian Federal Science and Industry Research Organisation chief executive Larry Marshall said in an interview with China News in Beijing that cooperation in the field of science and technology has shown tremendous potential, ranging from tackling climate change to the Tiananmen Project.
As the largest national research institution in the Australian Federation, CSIRO has achieved a number of world-renowned innovative results in the fields of oceans, energy, biology, materials, and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientific institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
“This is a lasting friendship that includes a tradition of trust and long-term cooperation with partners,” Marshall said.
In May this year, China’s 500-meter-diameter spherical telescope, China’s Sky Eye, installed its first international 19-band L-band receiver.
This is the world's most advanced 19-wave feeder receiver, developed jointly by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said the successful development of the receiver was based on the accumulation of many years of CSIRO technology. Upon its launch, the fast rotation speed would be increased five to six times, while expanding more scientific observation targets.
“This is one of the forces CSIRO has contributed to Fast.”
Besides the above mentioned cooperation, CSIRO also has close cooperation with Chinese scientific institutions in the construction of square kilometer array radio telescopes, research and development of new fuel technology, energy saving and reduction.
“In the past, scientific research has tended to focus on the problems of the next hundred years, and now more scientific efforts are needed to address the problems before us.”
Marshall believes that both Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, while both countries face a series of challenges in their development.
Extreme weather, for example, occurs all over the world, droughts and floods lead to food shortages and food shortages seriously affect human development.
At the same time, demographic explosions, aging, chronic diseases, and other problems are also present challenges.
“In recent years, cooperation between Australia and China has focused mainly on solving these present-day problems.”
CSIRO and the National Laboratory of Marine Science and Technology in Qingdao, the International Southern Hemisphere Marine Research Center, are working to observe the Ernino and La Nina phenomena, to study the relationship between the two and extreme weather conditions, and to establish early warning facilities for extreme weather conditions. CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have jointly developed new varieties of grains that can overcome extreme weather conditions and also help alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather conditions, Marshall said.
“In today’s environment, technological innovation is difficult to achieve on its own, costs are extremely high, and there are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is especially important today.”
Marshall said the closer the cooperation, the more likely it is to make breakthrough progress, which is also the significance of strengthening the cooperation between the two sides in the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.
“Enhanced bilateral cooperation, mainly in the field of technology, is important for us.”
For example, CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method that does not use cyanide, and many countries are hoping to find a less polluting gold purification method because traditional cyanide gold purification methods are very harmful to the environment.
“We are very willing to bring this technology into China, which is one of the results of our Belt and Road cooperation.”
On 29th, 2018 Bao Qi and Silk Road Tourism Promotion and Project Cooperation Encouragement Talk will be held in Urumqi, Xinjiang. Guests will be able to enjoy the local cuisine and experience the rich historical culture while admiring Bao Qi's development results.
During the month preceding the event, Bao Qi launched a series of tourism promotional activities in eight cities along the Silk Road, including Tian Shui, Pingxiang, Lanzhou, Silver River, Suiyuan, Xining, Zhangyee and Hami, and laid a good foundation for the success of the 2018 Bao Qi and Silk Road Tourism Promotional and Project Cooperation Encouragement Meeting.
The city is the second largest city in Shaanxi Province and the second-largest city in Guangdong Economic Zone and the second-largest city in Guangdong Plain Area, an important hub along the Bel Belt and Road Initiative.
In recent years, Bao Chi City has continuously upgraded the five functions of industrial cluster, logistics hub, integrated service, open high ground, and human cohesion, accelerating the pursuit of transcendence and the promotion of the Chinese economy.
At the meeting, the Tourism Development Committee of Baoqi City and the Tourism Bureau of Urumqi signed two strategic cooperation agreements on tourism.
At the same time, several travel agencies in Xinjiang have signed agreements on tourism cooperation with Bao Qi River scenic spots, Fengmen Temple Buddhist culture scenic spots, Tai Baishan scenic spots, Guanshan grassland scenic spots.
"There are some tourist resources in Xinjiang that are complementary to the chicken," said Chen Hongwei, director of the Department of Marketing and Promotion at the Beijing Tourism Commission. "We have come all the way to promote tourism in Xinjiang, mainly introducing the human chicken, the gourmet chicken, the natural scenery, and so on, and we have selected more than 500 photographs to let visitors and businessmen feel the beautiful scenery of the chicken," he said.
The event focuses on tourism resources, tourism projects, tourism routes, etc. By broadcasting tourism promotional films, promoting cultural tourism resources and projects, organizing tourism photography exhibitions, producing promotional prints, disseminating information, and exchanges on tourism cooperation, the event promotes the overall image of tourism, quality tourism products and fine tourism industry projects, consolidates Xinjiang's tourist source market, sings the "Look at China comes to Bao Qi" brand, enhances Bao Qi's influence and popularity in the northwest region, and attracts more Xinjiang tourists to Bao Qi's tourism experience.
Mr Feng Asahi, deputy director of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce and Investment, said: "This event has been an opportunity for all departments, county districts and development zones of Hong Kong to actively discuss and coordinate the implementation of a large number of good projects.
A total of 41 signed projects have been implemented so far, amounting to a total of 2.6 trillion yuan.”
In recent years, Bao Qi has pursued the objectives of building international cities along the Belt and Road ( Belt and Road) Initiative, famous cities for manufacturing equipment, historic and cultural sites, and beautiful and prosperous cities in the region, continuously improving the five functions of industrial clusters, logistics hubs, integrated services, open highlands, and the convergence of humanity, and accelerating the pursuit of transcendence and convergence.
In 2017, the region's total production amounted to $21.8 billion, an increase of 8.7%.
He has been awarded more than 20 national honors, including the National Award for Civilized Cities, the National Award for Ecological Garden Cities and the National Award for Chinese Residential Environment.
As a heavy town on the New Taipei Road on the Silk Road, Urumqi has a special geographical advantage, since ancient times connecting Tianshan to the north and south, communicating Xinjiang and the Mainland, crossing important channels between China and Central Asia, Western Asia and Europe, it is an important window to the west of China and foreign economic and cultural exchange, and has a good investment environment.
This event focuses on equipment manufacturing, logistics, trade and tourism industries, with the sincerity of cooperation to develop good opportunities and cooperation in the common business.
At the pledging meeting, local tourists in Xinjiang signed six projects with the districts of Bao Qi, involving an amount of RMB 322.5 billion.
On the same day, representatives of the Kyrgyzstan Visa Office in Urumqi, Russian New Siberia Law Co., Ltd., representatives of the Tajik Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Urumqi and representatives of the Russian Tatarstan Chamber of Commerce attended the pledging meeting.
Approximately 500 people from various departments, enterprises and media including the Mergers and Acquisitions Bureau, Commercial Bureau, Agriculture and Livestock Bureau, and Tourism Bureau of Urumqi City attended the plebiscite.
The development of the northeast is important for the development of the country.
Industrial enterprises in the northeast region are more important and well-founded than in the northeast, and for the northeast, to catch innovation is to catch development, to catch innovation is to catch future.
Will it be possible to revive and unleash the vitality of the old industrial base, which has attracted the heart of the General Secretary.
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho told the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would deepen North Korea's distrust of the United States and that it would not be possible to abandon nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Lee said that North Korea had taken “very friendly steps” over the past year, including stopping missiles and nuclear tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we haven’t seen any response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t trust the US, we don’t have confidence in our national security, and then we can’t give up weapons alone.”
Although Lee repeated North Korea’s objection to a “stage” denuclearization of the United States, his speech was significant because he did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization, as North Korea had done before.
Lee Yong-ho referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Trump on June 12, when Kim agreed to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged to protect North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States says it must give up nuclear weapons first.
The United States also refused to relax its demands for international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclearization first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its objectives in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue a ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Li said.
The idea that sanctions can make us kneel and beg forgiveness doesn't mean that our people are dreaming.
But the problem is that these continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Lee did not mention the U.S. president's plan for a second special session, which the United Nations had mentioned earlier this week.
Instead, he emphasized Kim Jong-un’s three meetings with South Korean President Wen Jiabao over the past five months, and said, “If the other side of denuclearization is Korea, not North Korea, then denuclearization on the Korean peninsula will not become so rigid.”
China has announced a reduction of 1585 import tariffs for tax purposes as of 1 November 2018.
Since this year, China has taken a series of initiatives to reduce import tariffs.
On May 1, this year, a total of 28 import tariffs will be reduced to zero for all common drugs, including cancer-resistant drugs, and for bioalgae drugs with cancer-resistant effects, as well as for Chinese medicines that are actually imported for tax purposes.
At the same time, the value added tax burden on the production and import of anti-cancer drugs has also been reduced considerably.
On July 1, the tax was reduced for 218 vehicles and parts for tax purposes.
After the tax cut, China's automotive wholesale tax rate has fallen below the average level in developing countries, in line with the actual Chinese automotive industry.
The tax cut will stimulate the adjustment of industry structure and the optimum allocation of resources, accelerate the advantages and disadvantages, and help to improve the quality of goods and services.
On July 1, 1449 items of daily consumption for tax purposes were reduced.
The reduction in the daily consumption tax is closely linked to the need for people to live a better life.
The tax cuts were not only large in number, but also massive, with an average of 56%.
The tax reduction on daily consumption products directly benefits consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
On November 1, 1585 industrial goods, such as mechanical and electrical equipment, parts and raw materials, for tax purposes will be reduced.
The appropriate reduction of import tariffs on some of the much-needed industrial goods in the country can attract more foreign investment, contribute to increasing domestic effective supply, assist industry upgrading, and at the same time help enterprises to allocate resources globally, reduce production costs, and reduce the domestic environmental burden.
The officials in charge of the Office of the Customs Code Committee of the State Council of China explained that the above-mentioned four autonomous tariff reductions and the third step, implemented on July 1 this year as a result of the broadened negotiations on the information technology agreement, would bring China’s total tariff level down from 9.8% last year to 7.5%.
The overall level of adjusted tariffs is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than that of most developing countries, at a moderate or low level, and is essentially in line with the status and development stages of China’s developing countries.
As one of the important indicators of the degree of openness in China's trade in goods, the overall level of tariffs should be adapted to China's economic development phase and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China is the world's largest exporter of goods and already has a further expansion of its open economic base. However, the quality and benefits of trade development are still different from those of developed economies, and the overall level of tariffs should be reduced accordingly.
Tariffs are the protective means of regulation, the level of tariffs should be adapted to the competitiveness of industry, to encourage good competition, overprotection is detrimental to industrial development and improve the quality.
The adjustment of tariff rates should take into account both production and consumption needs.
The focus will be on reducing domestic demand, which will help to improve the commodity tax rate of the industry, and on increasing the import of the specialized advantageous products that are more concentrated in the demand of the people, increasing the sense of enterprises and the public, and satisfying the need to upgrade the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction effort should take into account both the financial income and the industry's ability to bear.
In selecting specific goods and the range of tax reductions, it is necessary to coordinate both domestic and foreign markets, both sides of the economy, both sides of production and consumption, and maintain the steady and positive development momentum of China's economy.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and China's initiative to reduce the total level of import tariffs is a major step in China's own efforts to meet the needs of people living in poverty and hunger. It is conducive to coordinating the use of both international and foreign resources, promoting the improvement of the quality of the domestic supply system and meeting the needs of the people to upgrade their consumption.
This action and initiative demonstrates that China will remain firmly committed to its mutually beneficial and mutually beneficial open strategy, will firmly support economic globalization, will firmly uphold the principles of free trade and the multilateral trading system at the heart of the WTO, will continue to draw developmental momentum from its openness to the world, and will make China's development more beneficial to the world.
Serbia announces top military readiness The president of Serbia will meet tomorrow to discuss the situation in Kosovo
According to reports from the office of the Serbian President, Serbian President Vojislav Kostunica ordered the country's armed forces to enter the highest level of readiness in view of the occupation by Kosovo's ethnic forces of the access to the reservoirs of the Kozovoda hydroelectric power station, controlled by Belgrade, in northern Kosovo.
On 29 September, the Serbian Minister of Defence, Vojislav Bulin, declared that the Serbian army had entered a state of complete readiness.
He stressed that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as the orders issued by Wenceslaus remained in force, and that the Serbian army would respond to any developments.
On 29 September, the Russian daily Russotas reported that he had been briefed on the current situation by all sides, including the U.S., Russia and Europe, and that he would visit Moscow on 2 October to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to seek his support on the Kosovo issue.
When asked whether Serbia needed Russia’s military support, just as Syria needed, Wenceslaus refused: “I don’t want a major military conflict on our territory.”
But it is also a clear warning: there is absolutely no tolerance for any act of violence in Kosovo.
The Serbian army's increased readiness is linked to two major actions on the part of Kosovo.
According to the Serbian side, in recent days Albanians have been extensively arresting generations of Serbs living in the northern part of Kosovo, and those arrested Serbs have not violated any laws.
The army has been escalating the situation in the region, with inhumane arrests and expulsions of Serbs since March 26, when the head of the Serbian government's offices in Kosovo and Metohija, Marko Jurić, was beaten and detained by the Kosovo Armed Forces.
Moreover, more than 100 people, including the self-declared ROSU Special Forces, armed police and snipers of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kosovo, have occupied positions near the reservoir lake at the Katywoda hydroelectric power station, entered ecological and sports centres near the northern levees of the Kosovo region, and have blocked all roads nearby, areas which were originally controlled by the Serbian side.
Mr. Vucich points out that this military adventure by Kosovo was undertaken at the instigation of Western countries, without the prior notification of the Serbian side, in violation of Chapter IX, paragraph 1, of the Brussels Agreement, and in violation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 and the military-technical agreement between the two countries.
Bush has already called on NATO Secretary-General Steinberg to criticize Western rhetoric on the Kosovo issue.
The current source of the conflict is still the centuries-old bitterness between the Serb and Kosovo Serb communities.
Concerning Kosovo's affiliation, the Serbs and the Arabs have different opinions.
Serbia regards Kosovo as the birthplace and cultural cradle of a nation, since Serbia established its strongest state here in the 12th century, and the Assyrians migrated largely only after the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the defeat of the Serbian army in the north.
The Aryans maintain that the primitive tribe of the Illyrians who lived in Kosovo in the 4th and 5th centuries BC were the ancestors of the Aryans, and that Kosovo has been the territory of the Aryans since ancient times.
The subjective political divisions have led to intense conflicts between different ethnic groups, religions and cultures, resulting in intense confrontations between Serbs and Arabs in the Kosovo region.
In 1912, the Kosovars first declared Albania's independence.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanians living on the Balkans moved to Turkey, with the Serbs rising relatively steeply, the practice of "just regaining their own land" seen by the Serbs being seen as the plunder of "great Serbianism", and the conflict between the two communities intensified.
Kosovo has become the Balkans’ “burning bucket.”
In 1999, armed clashes between Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian army and police led to NATO bombings of the Serbian and Montenegrin Confederation, and the Kosovo War broke out.
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.
Although it was later reported that Serbia would normalize relations with Kosovo and sign a global and legally binding agreement, it was not possible to do so because of historical ethnic resentment and geopolitical constraints, and because of multilateral forces such as the U.S. and Russia.
And just a month ago, Bushehr made his first explicit statement in favour of separating Serbs and Arabs in Kosovo, once again exposing the conflict between the two.
Electricity communications still shut down Indonesia's tsunami rescue is in serious trouble
The strong earthquake and tsunami that erupted in Donggala County, the central province of Sulawesi, killed 420 people on 28 July, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency (DRR) on the morning of 30 July.
According to Wilem Rampangilei, director of the Indonesian Disaster Relief Department, the figures are preliminary statistics for the city of Pulu, in the central Sulawesi province, about 80 km from the quake, where many of the hotels, malls and warehouses damaged by the earthquake have not been rescued due to the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery.
On September 29, 2018, at local time, a bridge in Bali, Indonesia, which had been damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into several sections.
Due to severe damage to electricity and communications facilities, the affected county of Kalla and the adjacent Sikkim region are still unconnected “isolated islands” with no statistics on the number of casualties.
According to media reports, Indonesian Vice President Kamala claimed the death toll was as high as thousands.
Power outages, communications outages, road blockages, damage to airports... ...The rescue work after the earthquake and tsunami has been difficult.
Due to power failure, some hospitals and rescue shelters in Paro need to be powered by petroleum.
Roads in and out of the city were blocked by mountain slopes, which made it impossible for large transport vehicles, including tankers, to enter, and fuel supplies were strained.
Indonesia's Social Minister, Mr Agus, said emergency relief supplies such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods had not been delivered to the affected areas due to road damage from the ministry's neighbouring provinces of South Sulawesi and Colombo.
Relief supplies from the capital, Jakarta, are being transported to the affected areas by aircraft.
In view of the damage caused by the earthquake to the control tower and runway of the Paro Airport, all commercial flights to and from military aircraft for the transport of rescue supplies and personnel have been suspended in order to ensure safety and security.
Indonesia's Minister for Policy, Law and Security Coordination, Vilanto, who is in charge of the rescue in the quake area, called for the resumption of power supplies and commercial flight services at airports as soon as possible to ensure the operation of rescue agencies such as hospitals, and for more rescue personnel and volunteers and aid supplies to be able to reach the affected areas.
Severe earthquakes occurred in Donggula County, Sulawesi, Indonesia on 28 July, with a 7.7 magnitude earthquake at 17:02 local time causing severe damage to the city of Pulu, Donggula County, and Sikkim.
BEIJING, Oct 1 (Reporter Yin Liu) The blue sky is clean, the sky is clear, and the sky is full of sunshine ... ... Recently, Beijing continued to open the most beautiful blue sky model, drawing thousands of people on social platforms with flowery sketches and feelings of happiness on a continuous screen, saying "Blue sky under a white cloud, ' drunk' the blue sky line, this is Beijing's best movie."
Since August, Beijing has witnessed the “bluest sky.”
Within the city, you can see people everywhere, either with a smartphone or with a single camera.
On social platforms such as Weibo, Facebook Friends, etc., you can see the palace, Tiananmen Gate, bird's nest, Hutong ... ... various buildings show different beauty under the blue sky.
One of the netizens said that such a "big picture" is Beijing's best city promotional film; another netizen complained that if such a blue sky long-term screen, people with cervical spinal cord disease can be cured; and more netizens hoped "this blue can cross the winter to the spring to the summer, let the sky in Beijing's four seasons blue."
Why do people in Beijing especially love to sunbathe blue sky?
Just because people who lived in the city in the past suffered from the haze, and so longed for the blue sky, Beijing sounded the “war to protect the blue sky,” and after continuing to improve air quality, the haze decreased, the blue sky increased, and the people looked at the eyes with joy in their hearts, and the feeling of happiness gained was especially significant.
On the day of National Day, Beijing has a good weather.
At 8 a.m., the majority of the 35 air quality monitoring stations in the city displayed "green first class".
The "Bluest Sky" theme photography competition created by the public on the social platform is still ongoing.
Why is the sky so blue in Beijing recently?
The average concentration of fine particles (PM2.5) in Beijing was 35 microns per cubic meter in August, setting the best record in nearly five years, according to the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.
The real-time concentration of PM2.5 during September was even higher.
A major factor in the emergence of the Blue Sky is that the weather conditions are generally favourable in the near future. More importantly, Beijing has consistently conducted air pollution management and has been vigorously promoting clean air action plans for the past five years.
Beijing officially launched and implemented the Clean Air Action Plan 2013-2017 in 2013.
According to the plan, officials continued to guide non-capital decommissioning, promote energy cleaner alternatives and pollution reduction, eliminating a total of 4923 coal-fired boilers.
As a result, Beijing became the first major city in the Mainland of China to achieve full-net natural gasization.
Between 2013 and 2017, the cumulative decline in average PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing reached 35.6 per cent; the number of air quality-met days increased by 50 days; the number of first-class good days increased by 25 days; and the number of heavy pollution days decreased by 35 days, significantly reducing the incidence rate.
At the same time as the air quality continues to improve, Beijing officials, based on a new round of PM2.5 source analyses, released in September this year the Beijing Three-Year Plan of Action to Win the War to Preserve the Blue Sky, focusing on key areas of control, such as diesel trucks, dust, and volatile organic matter management, optimizing the adjustment of transport structures, industrial structures, energy structures, and land structures, strengthening regional joint defense and joint control, focusing on urban refinement management, and promoting green development in general.
During the Golden Week of National Day, the city tourism commission, industry, city administration, public security and other relevant departments will strengthen the enforcement inspection of the "one-day tour" market, focusing on the tourist "six-black" disturbances, and the illegal violators will be punished according to the law over and over and over again.
Yesterday morning, the municipality convened a special meeting on the fight against the illegal "day trip" to deploy special actions to further combat the illegal "day trip".
At the meeting, it was revealed that the city has launched a special campaign to crack down on illegal "one-day trips" since July 28, focusing on the "six-black" disturbances of black tickets, black guides, black companies, black cars, black shops, and black net interest chains intertwined.
To date, the city has received 39 "one-day trip" complaints, down 63% year-on-year; since this year, the city has received 270 "one-day trip" complaints, down 62% year-on-year.
Over the past two months, the city has seized 248 "black cars", detected 158 cases of trafficking in tourists, closed 29 shopping "black shops" and performing arts venues, detected 13 "black societies", 27 "black guides", confiscated 260,000 illegal advertisements, demolished 31 illegal "one-day tour" advertisements, 3 fake bus stations, detected 1,789 cases of illegal travelling, and filed 181 cases of administrative departments, fined 48.4 million yuan and detained 111 illegal travellers.
After the remediation, the unlawful "one-day" riots were basically contained, and the "one-day" market order showed a steady and positive trend.
According to the report, in recent years, the city has been steadily increasing the efforts to regulate the illegal "one-day trip".
In 2016 and 2017, the City Tourism Commission received 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints, respectively down 79% and 44% year-on-year.
In particular, illegal street-packers, known as “black ticket vendors,” publish false travel information on illegal websites, known as “black nets,” agencies or individuals engaged in illegal “one-day tours” or without the qualifications to operate them, known as “black companies,” guides employed by “black companies” without a guide’s license or without the qualifications to operate them, known as “black guides,” vehicles used by them without the qualifications to transport tourists, or vehicles with the qualifications to transport tourists, known as “black cars,” which provide tourist services for illegal “one-day tours,” and finally “black shops,” designated tourist shops where they bring tourists.
In this special action, the city has continued to increase the fixed inspection and mobile inspection of illegal "one-day trips", targeting the high frequency of illegal "one-day trips" and influencing the location of large travel routes, and the relevant departments send a day-to-day group of undercover visits to accompany a group of undercover visits, and after discovering the evidence of illegal violations, strictly investigate according to law.
Among them, “black cars” and “black shops” are the two strong focuses of the special action.
Unlawful "one-day trips" are said to be impossible without black cars, which are both easily detected, remembered and detected, and fixed assets of higher single-value.
The relevant departments use road traffic surveillance detectors to increase the supervision of the main "one-day-trip" route tourism buses, using technological and intelligent means such as technical and material protection to detect and locate "black buses" in a timely manner.
Travel shopping "black shops" due to the small number and seated operation, also becomes a strict focus.
In order to strengthen the deterrence and counter-attack against the illegal "one-day walk," each functional department shall be given over and over and punished according to the law whenever it is proved that there is an illegal violation.
In August this year, the city also convened a seminar on legal issues related to the illegal "one-day trip" and discussed measures to combine administrative punishment with criminal conviction.
The city's Tourism Commission said that more regular travel agencies would be encouraged to carry out Beijing's one-day trips in the future, and to increase the supply of regular one-day trips in order to further crowd out the living space of illegal one-day trips.
In addition, the City Tourism Commission is continuously improving the information system for travel group electronic itinerary, ensuring that each team is integrated into the electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a tourist symbol to a digital economic symbol, what has U town experienced these years
As the permanent site of the World Internet Congress, U Town how to accept the summit dividend is a matter of concern.
Since the first World Internet Congress, the changes in U town have been visible for five years.
In 2014, there were only 12 enterprises related to the digital economy and the Internet, and by the third quarter of this year, there were more than 500.
This is a sketch of U town's development of digital economy.
The meeting of the Internet Congress allows local enterprises to accept the digital economy and the digital wave of enlightenment from a distance. The desire of the enterprises to renew and upgrade is very strong. Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased their investments and R&D in machine replacement, intelligent management and so on.
Jiang Wei, the party secretary of U-Zhen, said that U-Zhen will create a new economic empowerment center in the future.
The development of digital economy cannot be supported by infrastructure.
This year, U town launched 5G pilot work based on the realization of 4G communication network and free WiFi full coverage.
At the same time, the city of Tongxiang, where U town is located, as the country's first county-level city to build an international Internet data exclusive channel, also becomes the hotbed of Internet industry development.
Since the first World Internet Congress, Tongxiang has introduced a total of 565 digital economy projects, with a total investment of 377.25 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the core digital economy manufacturing industry achieved a total output of 87.3 billion yuan, an increase of 13% year-on-year.
“U used to be a tourist symbol, but later it became a symbol of drama and culture, and because of the Internet Congress it has become a symbol of the Internet and digital economy.”
The secretary of the Tongxiang Municipality Party Committee, Mr. Mori Yuan, believes that as the profits from the World Internet Congress accumulate over time, there is also a need to build a platform to accommodate the overlapping of talents, projects, technologies and other elements of the parties.
She worked for 20 years abroad and returned to the country to start a business because of her connection to the Internet Congress.
On December 2, last year, he entered the fourth Internet Expo with a high-capacity anti-smuggling digital technology solution, which attracted a number of customers.
Shen Yi chose to start a business in Uzhou not only because of her hometown, “In Uzhou, it is easier to attract people than I imagined, and our applications are rapidly deployed, as are our applications in the Uzhou Smart Parking Project.”
A street of U Zhen, presents the overflow effect of the Internet conference.
This road, which runs north-south of桐乡, is not only a series of tourist attractions, but also an industrial avenue.
With its support, the U-Zhen Avenue Co. created a clustered area that should function.
The journalists learned that in the future, U Zhen Avenue will become the main center of industrial development in桐乡, taking the lead in applying the results of intelligent medical care, intelligent retirement, intelligent administration, etc., gathering industry and many high-level talents that account for 80% of the city's GDP.
The tsunami in Indonesia has killed at least 410 people
The earthquake in the central Sulawesi province has claimed the lives of 410 people, 97 of whom have been identified, according to the public information secretary of the Jakarta Police on Saturday night.
There were 29 missing and 540 injured.
The airport is currently closed.
With positive treatment, the survival rate of early childbirth in China has reached 98% for 29 weeks and above, reaching the level of developed countries.
Shanghai, Sept 30 (China) - The National Center for Children's Medicine (NCMC) at the University of Guangdong's Children's Hospital announced on September 30 that it is introducing Canada's advanced methods in the titled "China NICU Hospitalized Prenatal and Postnatal Quality Improvement Project".
The project results showed that, with positive treatment, the survival rate of premature infants aged 29 weeks and over in China reached 98%, reaching the level of developed countries, but there is still much room for improvement in the survival rate of premature and non-syndromed infants aged very young.
For nearly 20 years, the Chinese government has been concerned about the rescue of newborns.
At present, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai has fallen to 3.71 per cent, significantly below the national average and reaching advanced levels in developed countries.
Through four years of tireless efforts, the quality of life of premature babies has been greatly improved through the "Progress of Improvement of Prenatal Quality in Infirmary Hospitals in China" (NICU).
Professor Cao Yun, director of the Newborn and Emergency Syndrome Surveillance Unit (NICU) at Fudan University's Children's Hospital, told reporters that while improving the survival rate of premature babies, focusing on reducing the quality of survival of premature babies, reducing the incidence of complications, improving the neurodevelopment prognosis, improving the overall outcome of the child, is important for improving the overall quality of survival and population quality of premature babies.
Through four years of tireless efforts, the NICU Hospitalized Prenatal Quality Improvement Project (NICU) has collected tens of thousands of cases of premature babies aged 33 weeks or less across the country, resulting in a reduction of one-third in the premature mortality rate of infants aged and underweight in the country and a significant reduction in the incidence of serious complications in premature babies, significantly improving the quality of life of premature babies.
Through the establishment of a national network of collaborative networks to improve the quality of newborns, introduction of the concept of collaborative quality improvement, and the radiation of 25 collaborative hospitals throughout China, the project establishes a comprehensive, systematic and effective method of collaborative quality improvement to improve the quality of prenatal and postnatal care for newborns, and improve the level of treatment for newborns.
Based on the experience gained from the project, the Children's Hospital of Fudan University is working together with the National Newborn Children's Medical Force to formulate guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of newborn infections and provide guidance and reference for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of Chinese newborn infections.
It is known that in the China Prenatal Preparedness Quality Improvement Project, pediatric hospitals have introduced the EPIQ method into 25 large NICUs in 19 provinces of the country to address the problem of prenatal infections affecting China's nursing homes.
Over the past decade, Canada's national survival rate for early childhood complications has increased by about one-third, making it one of the best countries in the world for early childhood prevention.
The EPIQ method has now been applied to all NICUs across Canada and has been adopted in six countries.
According to pediatric hospitals, the study showed that after two years of EPIQ intervention, the incidence of early childhood infections decreased by 35%, while antibiotic use dropped by 20%.
In the future, the Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote and implement this method throughout the country with a view to reducing the incidence of all complications in early childbirth and improving the quality of treatment for newborns throughout the country.
Nowadays, there are differences and inequalities in the level of rescue in China's regions.
According to Professor Cao Yun, as an important construction unit of the National Center for Children's Medicine, pediatric hospitals will play a leading role in radiation. The study covers several western provinces such as Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu and Shaanxi, with the aim of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of the treatment of newborns throughout the country.
It is understood that the Children's Hospital, affiliated to the University of Fudan, is working together with the national neonatal care force to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the accumulated experience of the project and provide reference and guidance for the standardized diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections in China.
In 2019, the Coordination Centre, located in the China Neonatal Co-ordination Network at the University of Fudan's Children's Hospital, will jointly conduct the next phase of national quality improvements in 63 hospitals across the country, with the aim of promoting the uniformized development of Chinese neonatal care levels, it was revealed.
Shanghai can become a center city in Asia, not only in research, but also in the construction of the entire service system. The quality of service and the results of service should have a place in Asia, thus truly reflecting China's medical standards, said Zhu Yi, director of the Shanghai Health and Welfare Commission.
The "Heroes' Monument" in your heart--written on the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom.
On September 30, on the eve of the 69th anniversary of the Republic, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom. Xi Jinping and other leaders of both parties came to Tiananmen Square to attend the ceremony to pay flower baskets to the heroes of the people.
At this moment, wherever you are, please pay tribute to the hero.
The day of remembrance is warm and awakening.
Overturning the heavy history, every martyr's name behind, is a living life.
They also have a passionate youth, a genuine love, and a family.
However, because they firmly believed that “we believe in the truth of the universe,” they were willing to sacrifice everything to “avoid the suffering of the next generation.”
“One day I will live, one day I will cry for China.”
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual paths, guiding the way forward.
Where do you come from? Where do you go? What kind of person are you?
To commemorate the hero, the most important thing is to build a “hero monument” in your heart.
According to incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wars, about 20 million martyrs have dedicated themselves to national independence, people's liberation, and the nation's prosperity and bravery.
For various reasons, many priests did not even leave a name.
Innumerable heroes poured their ideals with blood, practiced faith with life, remembered their great name, inherited their spirit, which is to guard the roots and souls of the nation.
This "hero monument" will not be damaged or destroyed.
For some time now, history has been flourishing in a dark stream of nihilism, generalized entertainment and so on.
All kinds of distortions of history, devaluation of brave practices, challenge the wisdom of justice, misjudgment of value judgment, cause public indignation and alertness of the whole society.
Greatness cannot be profaned, heroes cannot be forgotten.
The act of touching the bottom line cannot be listened to, must dare to light the sword, defending brave dignity by the rule of law justice.
On 1 May this year, the Hero Hero Protection Act was formally enacted.
From the judicial practice, some cases are judged very quickly, both effectively maintaining the image of heroism and glory according to law, and releasing the right energy of honoring heroes and respecting the prophet.
A nation with aspirations cannot be without heroes, and a nation with ideals cannot be without pioneers.
Commemorating heroes and calling for heroes has become a universal social consensus.
At present, there are over a million memorials throughout the country, and more than a billion visits to the mausoleum every year.
The heart is the most solid foundation.
To glorify the heroes, defend the heroes, learn the heroes, love the heroes, to integrate the heroic spirit into the nation's bloodstream, a "hero monument" will stand high between heaven and earth, deep in the heart.
BRUSSELS, Sept. 28 – After Italy defied EU demands and surprised markets with its massive budget deficit plan, the EU took a non-confrontational stance against Italy on Friday, but the EU may take a more radical stance if Italy sticks to its too bold goal.
Italy’s suspicious European government aims to have a budget deficit equal to 2.4% of GDP over the next three years, indicating that debt cuts have not yet been made to the government alone, which is facing deficit cuts.
“We are not interested in the crisis between the Commission and Italy,” said EU Economic Commissioner José Manuel Moscovici on Friday, taking a cautious response as the EU’s proposals and sanctions may have little impact on Italy.
EU officials and diplomats still hope that market forces will persuade Italy to adjust its budgetary plan before it is formally submitted to the EU board in mid-October.
After the government announced its plans, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two weeks on Friday, while Italian bond yields reached their highest level in three weeks.
If the deficit target remains unchanged before the October deadline, the European Commission's executive board could reject Italy's draft budget, something it has never done to any country.
At a meeting later Friday in Riga, the Latvian capital, the Vice-President of the EU’s Board of Directors, Mr Eastbrovsky, said Italy’s current fiscal plan “seems to be incompatible with the Stability and Growth Convention,” referring to the EU’s fiscal provisions.
But he didn't say what the EU would do about it.
Tenders may submit their applications for participation in this public tender by 26 October this year.
Previously, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture has made China one of the priority markets for Russian agricultural exports.
In May, the Russian Agricultural Supervisory Authority announced that Russia's exports of food to China for the first time in this agricultural year exceeded 100 million tons, an innovative record.
The agency predicts China may be among the top ten Russian food importers.
After defeating Cuba 3–0 in the first round, China's women's volleyball team again won the 2018 World Championships in the group stage on 30 September, defeating Turkey 3–0 in the second round.
But compared to the first war, the Chinese women's lineup is more difficult.
A total of 24 teams participated in the 2018 Women's World Championships, with China in Group B with Italy, Turkey, Bulgaria, Canada and Cuba.
From the world rankings and overall strength of Group B teams, Turkey and Italy are China's main rivals.
After the start of the game, the Chinese team quickly entered the position, and the opening scored the lead, maintaining the overall advantage, in both the throwing and intercepting of the net to the opponent not little pressure, with 25:18 more successfully to take the first place.
The Turkish team, which entered the second half, was very aggressive and had a 6–2 lead at the start of the game, and after the Chinese requested a suspension, adjusted the lineup to keep the score to 7平, and then repeatedly intercepted the net and scored a 7–0 scoring surge; at the end of the game, the Turkish team once kept the score to 15:19; after China scored a point at 24:20, the stubborn Turkish team kept the score to 2 points; after China again requested a suspension, with Zhu Ting's running attack score, they took the second place at 25:23.
The situation in the third round was very tense, with both sides increasing the scores in exchange, one time scoring 19 points.
At the crucial moment, the Turkish team made a mistake, with China ahead 21:19, and scored 24:21 with Zhu Ting's strong shot and Zhang Changning's attack, followed by Turkey's score of 23:24, China's request for suspension, Zhang Changning's attack score, and China's score of 25:23.
Chinese women's volleyball coach Liu Ping admitted after the match that the whole match was not easy.
“We’re better prepared, the nets are good, the Turkish team’s technique is more comprehensive, and we’ve got to reduce errors and try to win through our own initiative.”
Faced with familiar teammates, playing for Turkey's Wakif Bank, Zhu Ting was constrained in the first round of the match that day, and then she made a move, still playing a strong attack.
“We are familiar with each other and are normally targeted by our opponents, but the Chinese team plays extremely well, intercepting nets and attacking well in an improbable situation.”
Next, the Chinese women's volleyball team will take a day off for physical and technical training, and on October 2, they will face their third opponent, Canada, in the group stage.
On September 30, 2018, a ceremony for the central opening of key projects in the Hebei Hebei high-rise district was held.
Six projects were launched that day, with a total investment of RMB 42.9 billion.
On the same day, the deputy mayor and chairman of the board of directors of the municipality announced the opening of the office.
According to Yao Happiness, director of the Hebei Hebei-Hangsu-Guangzhou new district administration committee, the six projects that have been launched today, with a total investment of 42.9 billion yuan, are all industrial projects. Among them, traditional industries have been revitalized and new industries have been brought in. The projects cover a wide range of industries, including military and civilian fusion, cloud factories, food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.
We believe that the construction and production of these projects will provide a powerful impetus for the advance realization of the goal of "building a billion-scale industrial park and striving to create a national high-level new district" in the high-level new district.
The deputy mayor, Yang Shi-kun, who is a member of the Standing Committee of Hengshui Municipality, announced the project's launch.
Yao said the area has successfully launched a series of major activities, including the China-Hangsu International Life Science Summit and the Greater Health Industry Forum, the Hangsu High-end Equipment Industry Summit of Chinese Academy of Sciences members, and the 2018-Hangsu Kyushu Jiao "Two Co-operative" Innovation Forum, to vigorously develop the three strategic emerging industries of new materials energy, the Greater Health and the High-end Equipment Manufacturing.
The US-China stem cell project will be officially launched by the end of the year.

In accordance with the deployment requirements, the regions have actively carried out the work and have lowered the ticket prices of a number of key state-owned scenic areas.
As of September 28, 981 free-to-open or reduce-price sites (74 free-to-open and 907 reduce-price sites) have been implemented or sent to the public, 159 of which are 5A-level sites and 534 are 4A-level sites, representing 70.6% of the total of 693 sites.
Of the 907 scenic spots with reduced prices, 491 fell more than 20 per cent, or 54.3 per cent, while 214 fell more than 30 per cent, or 23.6 per cent.
In Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces, the number of discount scenic spots is more than 100, and the overall decrease is more than 30%.
The government of eight provinces (districts and cities) such as Anhui, Chongqing, and other provinces set prices for 5A-level scenic spots all achieved a reduction in prices.
Reduced prices have been applied to popular scenic spots such as Yunnan stone forest, Dali Three Towers, Yulong Snow Mountain, Guilin Lijiang River, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Hunan Zhangjiajie, Shaanxi Warrior Terracotta, Jiangxi Sancheon Mountain, Xinjiang Canas, etc.
Key state-owned scenic spot ticket prices gradually return to reasonable areas, it is conducive to promoting the tourism industry to accelerate from the ticket economy to the industrial economy, from mass tourism to mass tourism, from scenic spot tourism to regional tourism upgrading, it is conducive to form a positive cycle of optimizing the supply structure of the tourism industry and increasing the demand for tourism consumption steadily, and it is conducive to promoting the sustainable healthy development of scenic spots and tourism industry.
At the same time, the National Development Reform Commission emphasized that the price order of scenic spots should be strengthened at all places, guided to improve the services of scenic spots, and ensured that the price decline is not degrading.
In addition, the State Development and Reform Commission has conducted a special inspection on issues such as the small drop in ticket prices for individual scenic spots reflected in the recent media, and the fact that the price is too low. The commission has called for serious action at all levels to respond to social concerns in a timely manner and implement the price reduction effectively.
Trade Promotion Bureau conducts short- to long-term optimization work in an orderly manner
The Macao Trade and Investment Promotion Bureau has submitted a report on the short- to long-term optimization of work relating to "major investment migrants" and "technical migrants". In addition to stepping up and implementing the work contained in the report, the Bureau has been continuously listening to the views of the community and continuously optimizing the contents of the report and related work.
The Trade Promotion Bureau will introduce the relevant optimization work to the community as soon as possible.
Five of these are short-term measures undertaken in this year; five are medium-term measures undertaken in 2019; and one is long-term measures.
In addition, UNCTAD has undertaken a comprehensive review of its internal management system, as directed by the Director of the Economic and Financial Division, Mr. Liang Viet.
The five short-term measures launched this year include:
1. To carry out the review work. Priority will be given to the review of cases coming to the end of the seven-year period, cases referred to in the ICAC report, and newly renewed cases. If cases of improper conduct or signs of illegality are found, they will be forwarded to the relevant judicial authorities for follow-up;
2. Field visits to projects involving "major investment migrants" have been conducted to the end of September on more than 20 investment projects;
3. A comprehensive review of the current appraisal system. Six principles for analysing investment projects have been re-established in the appraisal of "major investment immigration" applications. In the appraisal of "technical immigration" applications, the relevant approval mechanisms will be improved by clearly identifying elements favourable to the development of the Territory and the conditions for recruiting talent as a priority. At the same time, a list of "five industries and ten jobs" for the annual recruitment of talent has been established to better target the recruitment of talent in line with the policy direction of the Special Territories Government;
4. Increasing transparency of information. Including the phased publication of approval criteria, rating criteria and weighting from the fourth quarter of this year, and further refinement and disclosure of approval data;
5. In order to improve the work of the verification mechanism, prior verification has been requested of the work in O; major investments must be verified on the spot and financial statements submitted.
The five medium-term measures undertaken in 2019 include:
1. Establishment of a mechanism to regularly hear the views of the Committee on Talent Development and the Committee on Economic and Social Development, which had held a working meeting with the Committee on Economic and Social Development in September to discuss the establishment of such a mechanism.
2. Requests the applicant to submit annual financial statements prepared by independent third parties to continue to review the operational status of the investment project;

4. A comprehensive review of the current staffing arrangements to coordinate the implementation of various optimization measures;
5. Intensify the work on the revision of the temporary residence system for investors, managers and specially qualified technicians.
With regard to the long-term measures, to intensify the study on the reform of the law, it is anticipated that the drafting of the relevant regulations will be undertaken in the first half of 2019 with a view to completing them as soon as possible, further clarifying the criteria for approval and review of temporary residence permits, the review mechanism and the confirmation mechanism, and increasing the investigative functions of the Trade Promotion Bureau in order to more accurately approve and supervise applications for temporary residence permits.
The experts of the National Campaign on Non-Membrane Cotton and Research and Exchange Activities walked into the fields to hear the presentations of the team of the Chinese Institute of Engineering's Ming Shun.
Xinjiang Shaya, Xinjiang September 30, 2016 (Gongdandan Wang Xiaojun) A cluster of snow-white cotton is "opening up" and hanging full of branches at the no-film cotton planting test base in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
From 27 to 28 September, a national filmless cotton field visit and discussion and exchange event was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
At the Kwum meeting, reporters learned that the adhesive-free cotton technology system based on "China cotton 619" and its accompanying cultivation measures had initially achieved the goal of adhesive-free cultivation of cotton fields, reduced the pollution of the ecological environment and primary cotton by the residual membrane of Xinjiang cotton fields, and made significant progress in the research and demonstration of adhesive-free synthetic technology.
A member of the Chinese Institute of Engineering, a renowned breeder of cotton, and the chief scientist of the cotton system of the state modern agricultural industry technology system, Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Forestry (Zhejiang University of Agriculture and Forestry, Zhejiang) Zhou Kuomi introduced the growth of non-film cotton.
“The integrated technology that we have developed can completely realize the need to grow cotton without the use of land-based membranes, and can completely solve the problem of residual contamination and green cotton planting,” he said.
A member of the Chinese Institute of Engineering introduced Yu Xuan.
Xinjiang is the most important cotton-producing area in China, and according to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Xinjiang's cotton cultivation area was 35 million acres, accounting for 61% of the country's cotton area.
Since the introduction of soil films into China in 1982, the area covered by all kinds of agricultural crops in Xinjiang region has reached more than 5 million acres, and the annual use of soil films is about 300,000 tons.
Of these, cotton covering rate reaches 100%, and cotton field covering covers about 60% of the use of Xinjiang earth cover.
Measuring the production of non-film cotton, the production of cotton can be achieved from 320 kg to 350 kg per acre.
With the constant increase in the inputs of Xinjiang, the recycling rate of residual film is low, and the amount of residual film in the soil is increasing gradually. The residual film causes a series of problems such as damage to soil structure, and severely affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the soil, but also has a big impact on cotton fiber quality.
At present, more than one-third of the cotton fields in Xinjiang have been mechanized.
In 2017, Xinjiang's cotton production area was about 14 million acres.
In the process of cotton harvesting machine earns a large amount of land surface and cotton seeds crushed film, mixed in the raw cotton crushed film is difficult to clear in the process of raw cotton processing, and in the subsequent textile processing process can not completely clear, severely affect the quality of textile products.
On September 28th, a national filmless cotton field visit and discussion and exchange event was held in Shaya County, Xinjiang.
With the aim of tackling the contamination of cotton fields, simplifying cotton planting techniques, and improving the efficiency of cotton fields, Xiu Xuan led his team through eight years of implementation of the "China cotton 619" non-film cotton planting technology to "add wings" to the green development of Xinjiang agriculture.
He introduced the new Chinese cotton 619 series, which is especially ripe, salt-resistant, low-temperature, and fertile.
"The Chinese cotton 619 has achieved a series of supportive measures in the area of southern Xinjiang without membrane cultivation, such as the application of membrane-free sowing machinery, improvement of sowing depth, shallow burial of the droplet belt under membrane-free conditions, suitable sowing density screening, and reasonable chemical regulation."
At present, a demonstration base of non-woven cotton has been established in Aksu, Kuller and Alar, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
The cotton cultivation without membrane has achieved a high yield, saving cost, environmental protection and improved overall efficiency.
According to Zhang Donghai, an agrotechnician at the Third Division of Agriculture Department of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the production of cotton seeds can be achieved at 320 kg to 350 kg per acre, or even higher, thanks to nearly six years of research and demonstration of cotton-free cultivation technology.
“The prospects for promoting the technology of cotton-free cultivation are great.”
Zhang Dong Hai believes that the technology of non-film cotton cultivation can completely solve the problem of soil residual film pollution, but there is a certain gap between the economic benefits and the ground film cultivation.
“Support for cotton purchase prices will be beneficial for further promotion.”
The next step, he and his team will continue to conduct in-depth research and widespread application of film-free cotton to make the industry bigger and stronger, and to solve the soil pollution caused by the earth's membrane thoroughly, Xu said.
Guangdong Maritime Air Force Actively Responds to National Day's Golden Week Transportation - China Xin Network
September 29 was the seventh day of the Hong Kong high-speed line's official operation, and the first weekend since its opening.
The holiday of National Day Golden Week (October 1 to 7) will come to an end, and the relevant departments of the Ministry of Transportation will learn that the transportation sectors of Guangdong railway, aviation, water transportation, and highways will actively plan, increase their capacity, introduce safeguard measures, and make every effort to ensure the safety and order of passenger transportation within Guangdong during Golden Week.
Guangzhou Railway Bureau Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the Guangdong Railway Group) said it expects to deliver 1,780,000 passengers during the Golden Week of National Day this year, an increase of 150.5 million passengers year-on-year, or 9.2%.

Guangzhou Baiyun Airport is expected to be the busiest airport in the Mainland during the Golden Week of National Day this year, carrying more than 1.4 million passengers and landing more than 9,200 flights.
With the growing number of international flights, the airport is expected to see a significant increase in international passengers this year's Golden Week holiday compared to the previous one.
Singapore, Bangkok, Pyongyang, Jakarta, Colombo, Maldives, Manila, and other popular destinations for this year’s National Day holidays are known to have continued to explode, with some flights “unreliable.”
Some airlines have increased their schedules in particular, such as Shenzhen Airlines with one new Guangzhou–Guangdong flight per day; Iranian Mahan Airlines with one new Guangzhou–De Ha Lan flight per week; Vietnamese Cheetah Airlines with one new Guangzhou–Guangdong flight per week; and Vietnamese Airlines with one new Guangzhou–Guangdong flight per week.
In order to ensure holiday security, Baiyun Airport has increased the strength of security of key positions such as "seat allocation", "baggage security", "value aircraft service" and "passenger safety inspection", and prepared for handling large-scale flight delays.
China's Southern Airlines said the flights to New Zealand, North America and South Korea during the Golden Week of National Day this year were highly explosive, while flights to mainland China destinations such as Hainan, Chengdu, Luzhou, Jiu Huashan, Anshan and Huangshan were more attractive.
Southern Airlines plans to increase 50 flights during the Golden Week, including 10 flights to and from Guangzhou on the Qing Mai Line.
The Guangdong Department of Maritime Affairs said it had conducted a thorough inspection of key vessels such as water tourism boats, cruise ships in the Jiangsu Strait, high-speed passenger boats at the Pearl River mouth and ferry boats in order to ensure the stability of maritime traffic safety during the long holiday period.
During Golden Week, Guangdong Province's traffic is expected to remain at the top of China's rankings.
The Guangdong Transport Group recently issued guidelines for traveling on holiday highways, and expects the highway traffic to increase by about 12%.
The General Administration of Market Regulation recently issued the Notice on the Strengthening of Market Price Regulation during the Mid-Autumn National Day in 2018.The Notice calls for the strengthening of price regulation in housing leasing and real estate, the strict regulation of rent prices, the hoarding of rent sources, the fabrication of false information to inflate rents, the misleading charges by bundling services, the publication of misleading price information, unknown code mark prices, and other price violations.
Notify clearly, to strengthen price monitoring early warning, close attention to market price dynamics.
There is a need to pay close attention to food, meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, salt, and other basic necessities that are consumed by the local population, as well as to the market and price changes of the local people's special holiday consumption commodities, and to strengthen price monitoring and analysis early warning.
Once the tendency of market fluctuations is detected, measures are taken in time to solve the problem effectively.
It is necessary to strengthen supervision and inspection of wholesale retailing of necessities for life, increase the frequency of monitoring and supervision of places closely related to the daily consumption of the masses, such as supermarkets and agricultural markets, and urge operators to adhere to the law and conduct business.
The notice noted the need to strengthen inspections in key areas to create a good holiday consumption environment; to strengthen the regulation of ticket prices for state-owned scenic spots; to focus on the investigation of violations such as non-implementation of price levels or fluctuations prescribed by the government, unauthorized establishment of charging projects, variations in ticket prices, high-priced large discounts, bundled sales, non-compliance with specified clear-code marking, non-implementation of preferential measures, extra-priced pricing, and compulsory substitution of fees for state-owned scenic spots.
Notify requests to strengthen the regulation of prices of essential commodities, especially agricultural products.
Due to seasonal changes, natural disasters and outbreaks of epidemics, some regions have seen fluctuations in the prices of agricultural products, such as vegetables and pork, which are essential for life.
It is necessary to strengthen the price regulation of agricultural by-products in accordance with local realities, coordinate with relevant departments in order to stabilize production and market supply, and organize efforts to carry out market focus inspections and random excavations.
Increase the frequency of inspections of products such as poultry meat, which is subject to supply constraints and prices are rising faster, and seriously investigate illegal acts such as stockpiling, price manipulation, and price hikes.
The notification indicated the need to strengthen price regulation in housing leasing and real estate.
The mid-autumn and national holidays coincide with the peak of the housing leasing and commodity housing sales season, and all parts of the country should pay close attention to the price behaviour of real estate enterprises, intermediaries and housing leasing-related enterprises, tightly regulate the price of leases, hoard the sources of rent, fabricate false information to inflate leases, charge misleading prices by bundling services, publish misleading price information, unknown code marking prices, etc., and intensify the inspection of the situation in selling hot selling flats and real estate intermediaries with clear code marking prices, and investigate the conduct of harming consumers' interests and disturbing the market order by not implementing the "one-size-fits-all" as required, purify the real estate market environment, and create an open and
The notice stated that all parts of the country should effectively supervise prices in other sectors of the tourism industry, strive to standardize the price order in catering, accommodation, shopping, sightseeing, entertainment, parking and other sectors, guide operators to make clear-digit marking of prices, publicizing charges, and seriously investigate all kinds of price violations.

In order to innovate regulatory means and working methods, strengthen the promotion of the laws and regulations on the prices of retail enterprises and e-commerce platforms, urge operators to improve the price promotion schemes, investigate illegal acts such as false original prices, misleading price indications, non-fulfilment of price commitments in accordance with law.
The passenger traffic has grown steadily since the 15th anniversary of the Hong Kong-Shanghai direct train, which has been speeded up three times, and the total number of passengers travelling from and to both Hong Kong and Shanghai has exceeded 1.7 million.
At the same time, Hong Kong and Macau passengers are not allowed to cross the gate for more than 15 seconds.
On October 1, 2003, the State Council approved the establishment of a temporary port for direct trains from Shanghai to Kowloon, the Shanghai Railway Port as the first direct passenger port for Hong Kong long-distance railway in China.
So far, the Shanghai-Hong Kong train has run straightforward for 15 years.
The Shanghai Railway Border Inspectorate, which carries out the task of inspection of direct trains to and from Shanghai-Hong Kong, unveiled on Monday that, since its opening, the Shanghai-Hong Kong trains have been speeding up three times, reducing the daily journey time from nearly 30 hours to 19 hours; the annual flow of passengers to and from Shanghai-Hong Kong has increased from less than 80,000 to more than 150,000 times; and in the past 15 years, the total volume of passengers transported between Shanghai and Hong Kong has surpassed 170,000 grand gates.

Wang Yi, China's State Secretary and Foreign Minister, said in a speech to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Relations on Friday that relations between China and the United States are at a crossroads once again, and that better prospects could be created if both sides were able to take an active and inclusive view of each other, deepen and deepen positive cooperation, and properly manage differences and contradictions.
“China-US relations are our common asset and need to be taken care of together.”
He said he hoped that the wise men from all walks of life of the two countries would take practical action to maintain the healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations and jointly push the Sino-US relations forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also stressed once again that China will surely take a different path to development from the traditional big powers.
This path, characterized by China, has determined that China will not and will not be able to repeat the legacy of the ruling power. It has also determined that China will neither become the United States nor challenge the United States nor replace the United States.
In a speech entitled "Opportunities or Challenges, Partners or Opponents," Wang Yi said the deep-seated problem faced by some American friends was that China would be the dominant country, and even challenge and replace America's world leadership.
“This is clearly a major strategic misunderstanding.”
But this self-imagining suspicion, he said, is spreading and amplifiing the existing contradictions, creating new doubts and making it harder and more obstructive to resolve specific problems between the US and China.
Wang Yi points out that China is on a path of peaceful development.
Chinese have never had an externally extended gene.
We believe that countries can coexist harmoniously and communicate with each other.
Whether in the past, now, or in the future, China will neither follow the foreign model nor demand that other countries copy China’s practices.
Wang Yi, who met with former U.S. Secretary of State George W. Bush in New York earlier this year, said that US-China cooperation would be double-win, and that confrontation would inevitably be double-win.
China has always been committed to developing long-term healthy and stable relations between China and the United States, achieving non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect, cooperation and mutual gain.
The newly established State of China holds a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the White Paper on the facts and China's position on the Sino-US trade and economic friction.
China wants to push bilateral trade in a more balanced direction and hopes the U.S. will also show a positive stance, Deputy Commerce Minister Fu said at the press conference.
The Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a powerful tsunami on September 28 with severe damage to several cities along the coast, and the latest figures show that the death toll has risen to 1,200 people.
It was reported that the nearby town of Donggala, Palau, was hit by two tsunamis, and authorities believe the number of casualties will continue to rise as the "golden 72 hours" of rescue go by.
On September 30, 2018, rescuers picked up an earthquake survivor who had been rescued from the ruins of a restaurant in Pulu, Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Disaster relief officials said the waves brought about by the tsunami were 6 meters high, and the extent of the earthquake and tsunami impact exceeded previous estimates.
It was reported that hundreds of people were celebrating the holidays on the beaches of Palau when the earthquake and tsunami occurred, and many were killed by the waves.
Officials said the tsunami hit the shore at 800 kilometres per hour, destroying many buildings and infrastructure.
Thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and the tsunami-induced mudslides cut off a major road in Palau, he said.
A bridge across the coastal river collapsed in Sulawesi.
On September 30 at local time, Indonesian President José Ramos-Horta visited the city of Sulawesi in the aftermath of the earthquake.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the area on September 30, saying he had sent troops to assist in the search and rescue and appealed to the people to be patient.
Saco pointed out that rescue operations were difficult due to the lack of heavy machinery and personnel.
He noted the lack of food, water and fuel supplies in many of the affected areas, as well as the closure of many businesses after the earthquake and the deployment of aircraft to deliver supplies.
He appealed to the victims to be patient and to stay in their original positions and wait for rescue.
Paro search and rescue workers said they heard a call in a collapsed hotel in the city, but were unable to remove the rubble without heavy machinery, and some people needed helper.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami could eventually rise to thousands, Indonesia's Vice President, Mr. Karla, said, as electricity and communications were cut off in some areas causing a lack of communications.
The courts in Liaoning province have severely cracked down on non-execution during the six-month-long storm campaign, transferring 241 people for non-compliance, and maintained a high level of pressure to combat non-compliance.
It is understood that, according to the uniform deployment of Liaoning High Court, from the beginning of April to the end of September, the Liaoning Court conducted a six-month-long "storm" battle to resolve basic implementation difficulties, gathering the superior forces and launching a comprehensive general offensive against basic implementation difficulties.
At the same time, the provincial courts organized according to law the "five batches" of fines, detention batches, restrictions on consumption batches, distrust punishment batches, and transfer of denied conviction batches.
At the beginning of the campaign, there were more than 13.2 million unsolved cases in the province's courts, and by the end of July the cases had been cleared.
In all, the provincial courts fined the executed persons $106.07 million, detained 4146 people, restricted consumption 162844 people, punished 51,528 people for failure to pay their debts, and transferred 241 people for refusing to pay their debts.
Between January and October of this year, the Liaoning Court received 297,438 execution cases, an increase of 13.28 per cent; executed 226,558 cases, an increase of 83.18 per cent; and executed 31,336 billion yuan, an increase of 74.94 per cent.
" Where can I get a taxi, please?
We'd like to see the national flag raising ceremony in the Golden Purple Tree Square. "
In the morning of October 1, the Song family, travelling by plane from Ningxia to Shenzhen on the first day of National Day on the Guangdong-Hong Kong High-Speed Railway in Shenzhen, received a visit from a reporter at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong.
On the morning of 1 October, to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region held a solemn flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Purple Square.
As of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via the West Kowloon railway station has exceeded 300,000, according to the Immigration Control Station statistics.
On the occasion of the 69th anniversary of the birth of the motherland, the West Kowloon Quarantine Station is expected to have a peak of passengers visiting Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
At 7 a.m. on January 1, reporters were allowed to visit Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Hall. Many Mainland tourists boarded high-speed trains to visit Hong Kong during the Golden Week of National Day.
Mrs. Song, who walked lightly, told reporters that the National Day holiday is a difficult long holiday in the year. She has always wanted to see the flag raised in Hong Kong's Golden Lily Square, and she feels especially happy and excited to be able to achieve that wish on National Day.
However, the flights from Ningxia to Hong Kong are currently inconvenienced and can be operated on the Hong Kong section of the high-speed railway. Mr. Song checked the timetable of the train and found that the first train could arrive at 7:3 a.m. to connect the city's transportation to the Jinqiang Square, which was just fine.
He exclaimed to reporters: " The high - speed railway is really convenient and fast and on time! "
The daily short-distance trains to and from southern Guangzhou, northern Shenzhen, Fuda and West Kowloon operated by 70 trains in one hour greatly facilitate the arrival of residents in the Hong Kong and Macau Great Bay Area.
Mr. Liu, a resident of Shenzhen, is preparing to visit his Hong Kong friends at the top of Mt.
Mr. Liu said: " The mainland and Hong Kong are on holiday on National Day. We're going to challenge ourselves and see if we can finish the 50 km of Hong Kong Island Trail! "
He explained that if the high-speed railway had not been opened, it would have been convenient and timely, and they would not have been able to try such long-distance hiking.
Mrs. Yang, from Dongguan, brought her 10-year-old son to Hong Kong on a high-speed train to participate in the piano competition. She proudly told reporters that her son had been learning to play the piano for three years and that it was meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She had been on a bus before coming to Hong Kong, but it took a lot of time, and she was worried about affecting her son's condition. She came through Shenzhen on the high-speed train, which was convenient and half-time-consuming, and the journey to Hong Kong was even more impressive.
At 6:44 p.m. on 23 September, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed train departed from Shenzhen North Station and ran along the way. A few minutes later, the train entered the Hong Kong section of the Guangdong-Hong Kong high-speed train, the first officially operating high-speed train for the Hong Kong section.
The Hong Kong section of the national high-speed rail network, which runs directly to 38 long-distance stations across the country, also welcomes mainland passengers from different provinces in southern and northern China.
Mr. Ho told reporters when visiting Hong Kong from Changsha on a long-term vacation that he was very happy to be able to eat lunch with his children at home by taking the high-speed train to the north of Shenzhen, and then to cross Hong Kong via the subway to get around the city.
He said the “one-stop-shop” procedure was more convenient than anyone could have imagined, “within 10 minutes, both gates were closed.”
The nearby West Kowloon station, which connects the airport and air traffic, is also the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Ms. Wu, from Fujian Prefecture, is preparing to spend the Golden Week with her sisters from Hong Kong to the Philippines. She pushes her luggage at the gate in West Kowloon and says to the reporter: " I was afraid I couldn't catch the plane, I didn't think it was so fast, and there's plenty of time! "
The new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, announced Monday, will retain President Donald Trump’s ability to implement a 25% tariff threat on imports of cars while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks, and car parts imported from Canada and Mexico, according to the trade agreement’s subsidiary arrangements.
If Trump imposes the so-called “232-chapter” tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada would each have 260,000 tax-exempt fares to export to the US each year.
Pursuant to the subsidiary arrangements, packets produced in the two countries will be fully exempted from duties.
If Trump imposes auto-tariffs, Mexico will receive an annual tax exemption of $1.080 billion for auto parts, and Canada will receive $324 billion.
Both quotas are much higher than the two countries' current production levels and provide room for growth for both countries' exports.
LET'S GO Washington/Mexico September 28 – After several days of debate, the government of US President Donald Trump and Canada are making tangible efforts to resolve trade-policy differences, with the expectation that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will remain in the form of a tripartite agreement, Mexico said on Friday.
Despite the lack of details, the above-mentioned obvious progress is sufficient to prompt the Mexican and US Governments to suddenly stop announcing plans for the text of the bilateral trade agreements and give Canada more time to join the agreements.
In Mexico, Mexico's presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, told reporters that the U.S. government had put forward new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and that he would continue to push for all three countries to join NAFTA.
Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said the time for submitting the text of the bilateral trade agreement to Mexico's and US legislation was delayed because the Canadian and US governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
“In the next 48 hours, we will know whether we have reached a text of a tripartite agreement or whether we have to publish a text of a two-party agreement,” he said.
Guajardo said his US and Canadian counterparts "specially requested" that the text be postponed.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative Office (USTR) did not comment on the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico and on the consultations between the U.S. and Canada.
Officials from the Office of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs have not responded to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
In a conservation centre in the suburbs of South Africa's capital, Pretoria, two lion cubs are playing together. It's hard to see anything unusual, but they're not the only ones, foreign media reported.
The University of Pretoria declared: “This is the world’s first pair of young lion born artificially.”
The school's scientists are working on the reproductive system of the African lion.
The two young lions, one female and one male, born on August 25, are quite healthy and normal, said Ganswent, director of the Institute of Mammals at the University of Pretoria.
After 18 months of intensive testing, his team finally achieved this breakthrough.
“We collect semen from a healthy lion,” Ganswick said in a press interview.
The researchers then artificially fertilized the lion when the hormone content in the lion reached the appropriate level.
“Luckily, the result has been successful,” Ganswick said.
He said the researchers “went through several attempts, but surprisingly, they didn’t spend too much effort.”
He said the breakthrough could be replicated and that scientists hoped to use the technology to save endangered large cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that lions have been extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of wild lions that have survived has declined sharply by 43% over the past 20 years, with only about 20,000 left.
The African lion is listed as an endangered animal by the organization.
“If we don’t do something about these animals, they’re going to be extinct,” Ganswick said.
This new technology, he says, doesn't have to feed the lion, but simply injects sperm into the fertile mother lion, just like it has been done with elephants in North America and Europe.
South Korea's September export decline was the largest in more than two years, but analysts blamed the decline on fewer working days and said global demand for South Korean goods remained strong despite rising trade tensions between the US and China.
Indeed, South Korea's exports increased on a daily basis last month.
Additionally, the earlier-released preliminary figures show a doubling in exports in the first few weeks of September prior to the long holiday.
South Korea’s exports declined by 5.7 per cent year-on-year in September, the largest since July 2016, in line with the 5.7 per cent decline forecast by Reuters’s 11 analysts.
Initial figures released Monday showed exports in September amounted to $506 billion, down from $512 billion in August.
Despite growing concerns that US-China trade disputes could harm other export-dependent neighbors, South Korea’s exports to China grew by 7.8% in September, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
South Korea’s exports to the United States fell 11.8%, owing to a decline in oil sales.
Overseas sales of Korean memory chips and petroleum products grew by 28.3% and 13.5%, respectively, despite market concerns that the so-called chip “super cycle” may have reached its peak.
“However, the impact of trade conflicts will be difficult to avoid, as South Korea’s exports rely heavily on US and Chinese markets.”
Imports fell 2.1 per cent to $40 billion, less than the 3.1% growth projected by the Reuters poll.
In September, the trade surplus initially stood at $97 billion, up from $69 billion in August.
The industry ministry says global manufacturing will remain flourishing thanks to the US and EU countries, which is a favourable factor for South Korean exports.
The statement noted that “the increase in export prices caused by rising oil prices will also benefit exports in the second half of this year.”
“However, the continuation of the US-China trade conflict, coupled with increased market volatility following the US interest rate hike, are negative pressures on exports.”
Exports increased to $226 billion per working day on average in September and $221 billion in August.
South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 24-26, so September has only 19.5 working days, down four days from the same period last year.
South Korea's exports grew by 4.7% in January-September compared to the same period last year.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, South Korean manufacturing activity picked up in September, but was backed up by domestic orders, as orders from China and Japan declined, threatening to cloud other export prospects.
North Korean media criticizes US for failing to ease sanctions against North Korea
In a September 30 commentary in the Korean newspaper Labour News, he criticized the US's failure to relax sanctions on the DPRK while seeking dialogue with the country, calling it a "self-contradictory" approach.
The article said US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on 14 April that “the key to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the implementation of sanctions against the DPRK,” stressing that the United States remains committed to the implementation of the UN sanctions resolution.
In the Singapore-US Joint Statement, the two sides pledged to establish new relations with the United States in line with the aspirations of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.
The United States, on the one hand, is demanding more sanctions and more pressure, and on the other, dialogue, which is undoubtedly contradictory.
If new relations are to be established between the two countries, a permanently consolidated peace system is to be established on the Korean peninsula, and a complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is to be achieved, trust should be placed first, starting with what can be done and resolving it step by step.
The article also said the US should understand that sanctions against North Korea do not work.
The article said that even the "Northern Vancouver" before the "Kazan" made the U.S. admiration.
The National Interest magazine quoted the US Navy’s view: “We’re going to face a powerful potential rival. Just look at the North Devonsk submarine.”
The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. Navy in Europe, Commander-in-Chief Fugo, also paid tribute to the North German submarine.
“The submarine is impressive,” he said, “and if you look at the development of the Russian Navy and how it uses its resources, the main effort it makes in research and development is first and foremost to strengthen its fleet.”
But the National Interest magazine still believes that the United States holds an advantage over Russia in this area.
“I believe that the West still has asymmetric advantages,” Fogo said.
It was previously reported that the Russian Navy would deploy the Kazan submarine in 2019.
Kazan, New Siberia, Krasnoyarsk, and Arkhangelsk multi-purpose submarines were upgraded to the White Wax Tree-M, with a discharge capacity of 13,800 tons and a dive depth of 520 metres.

Not long ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping was invited by Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend the Fourth Eastern Economic Forum.
It was his first time at the forum.
Disregard the threat of the United States!
The EU or to reach a crude oil procurement agreement with Iran
The U.S. government recently announced it would reintroduce a new round of sanctions against Iran in November, and even urged other countries to reduce imports of Iranian oil.
But America's allies seem not to have listened.
Despite threats from the United States to sanction any country doing business with Iran, Tehran is approaching an agreement with the EU on crude oil sales, the New York Times reported on 29 October, when Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif was interviewed.
The core purpose of the agreement is to attempt to establish a new payment mechanism, i.e. to replace dollar transactions with easy-to-use or currency-based valuations.
The aim is to circumvent the United States and prevent the United States from obstructing financial transfers.
Meanwhile, while the EU is committed to facilitating the agreement, some French and British officials are also concerned that if it is implemented, it will be the most open confrontation between the EU and the US, which opposes the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.
Zarif's words sounded more optimistic than they have in recent months in one hour's interview, media reports said.
Because the agreement has the ability to “deprive” America of its traditional allies, it effectively breaks the US’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.
“This will ensure that we sell oil and profit,” Zarif said, arguing that countries have the legitimate right to trade with Iran under the 2015 agreement.
“No sovereign state or organization can accept others to decide who it can trade with,” EU foreign policy chief Federico Mogherini said earlier.
She also predicted, however, that US leaders could take a series of financial measures aimed at banks, traders and states with business ties to Tehran before the US government launches its next sanctions in November.
In May this year, the US government unilaterally declared its withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, citing its flaws, and said that the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iranian oil and other commodities from operating in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to withdraw from Tehran and the Iranian currency plummeted.
Companies such as Airbus and the French oil giant Daul have cancelled billions of dollars in investments in Iraq.
British and French officials have said that the US government may be “overtaking.”
Indeed, according to a recent Turkish media report, US sanctions do not appear to have had a significant impact on Iran’s oil exports.
No other country except South Korea has stopped buying Iran's oil, Iran's oil minister Zangger said earlier.
Both Zarif and Iranian President Ruhani believe that a series of US actions are aimed at “seducing” Iran to violate the agreement.
Zarif is also dismissive of a series of verbal attacks by the US, and when asked whether the US will overthrow the current Iranian government with ever-increasing fiscal pressure, Zarif even laughed: “It’s a strategy of regime change, and that’s what the US really wants.”
"Retour Cannon Memorial" : Xiamen Huli Mountain Cannon Cultural Tourism City Opens
In the same year, the first broadcaster of the Fujian front-line radio station, Mr. Chen Feifei, came to the canoe to recall the history of the canoe.
The famous scenic area of Xiamen Huli Mountain cannon area, separated from Jinmen one water, was once the home of the People's Liberation Army establishing the "front line radio station".
On the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the front-line broadcasting station, the scenic spots will host the "Revisit Canton Memorial" event, inviting a number of witnesses to the history of the front-line broadcasting station to talk about the changes in the history of the canton and witness the development of relations between the two sides.
Witnesses of the former station's history tell the story of the artillery.
This is one of the activities of the second series "Xamen Huli Mountain Cannon Cultural Tourism City Collection" of Huli Mountain Scenic Areas.
Earlier, the first event was successfully organized here to create a specialized cultural tourism brand that includes a collection of cultural tourism IP, creative city collection and traditional folk culture experiences.
On the same day, the second edition of the "Old Canoe / New Era" cultural tourism festival, organized by the Xiamen City Travel Commission and the Xiamen Huli Mountain Canoe scenic area, officially opened its doors. The six-day event will be based on the Mid-Autumn and National Day "Journey Round" and will allow visitors to visit and experience the rich Minnan spirit in multi-dimensional "eating," "living," "buying," and "entertainment."
The "Listen to the Sound of the Sea" concert has become one of the main sights of the Canterbury Cultural Tourism Festival.
Wang Yuan, director of the Huli Mountain Cannon Control Office, said the "Retour Cannon Memories" event, which was held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the front line broadcasting station of the Huli Mountain Cannon, invited several old broadcasters to tell the history of the cannon to remind people of the old days.
In addition, this year's tourism city collection series also includes 40th anniversary of reform and opening of the country choral concert activities, old photos selection activities, 2018 Strait Cross-Strait "Hare Little Queen" large monolithic art equipment public exhibition activities, etc.
Among them, the "Listen to the Sound of the Sea" concert as a major point of view of the Cantonese Cultural Tourism City Festival, is a special cultural brand activity created by the scenic spots, invited Xiamen City Youth Palace Phoenix Flower Women's Choir to help the effort, singing the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening of the Cantonese in Yingshan accompanied by the sea, showcasing the collision of "Cantonese" and "New Era" fusion.
The large-scale public-private exhibition of single-body art installations, "Haun Xiaofei," on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, was held during the National Day in the canyon area, focusing on creating an "eye-ball effect," attracting a large number of tourists and citizens to visit, filming, transferring friends and family, filming shaking, and adding a "net red" factor to Xiamen the city.
And the "Xamen, 40 years, you and me," – the selection of old photographs, sets up an exhibition of award-winning works within the scenic area, through a photograph with a temperature, deeply digging into those moments of happiness and emotion.

"Green Water Blue Mountain is Gold Mountain" was first written into the legislation of Fujian Province. Throughout the ordinance, it became operational and enforceable.

In order to further encourage foreign investors to invest in China, the Chinese Ministry of Finance and other four ministries jointly notified that from January 1, 2018, the profits allocated to foreign investors from enterprises resident in China will be used for the purposes of the temporary suspension of the pre-taxation policy on domestic direct investment, extending from foreign investment-encouraging projects to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
According to a related notice posted on the Treasury website, foreign investors who are temporarily exempt from the imposition of pre-paid income tax must meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investments by foreign investors for profit-sharing, equity investments by foreign investors for profit-sharing, new investments, equity acquisitions, and so on, but excluding new investments, transfers, and acquisitions of listed companies' shares (except for strategic investments that meet the conditions).
It also includes interest-bearing investment income such as dividends and dividends generated by the dividends and dividends earned by overseas investors belonging to residential enterprises in China that are actually distributed to investors.
Where the profits of foreign investors for direct investment are paid in cash, the relevant amounts shall be transferred directly from the accounts of the profit-sharing enterprise to the accounts of the invested enterprise or the transferee of equity, and shall not circulate in other accounts outside the territory of the State before the direct investment; where the profits of foreign investors for direct investment are paid in non-cash forms such as tangible assets, valuable securities, and so on, the ownership of the relevant assets shall be transferred directly from the profit-sharing enterprise to the invested enterprise or the transferee of equity, and shall not be held or temporarily held by other enterprises or individuals on their behalf before the direct investment.
Notification shall also be given that foreign investors, by transferring, repurchasing, liquidating and so on, shall actually recover the direct investments benefiting from the temporary non-imposition of the proposed income tax policy treatment and, within seven days of the actual collection of the corresponding amount, shall declare to the tax department the delayed payment of the tax in accordance with the prescribed procedure.
In order to encourage overseas investors to continue to invest and operate in China, the four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce, jointly issued notices at the end of 2017 that, from 1 January 2017 onwards, the profits allocated to overseas investors from enterprises resident in China will be invested directly in investment projects in the encouraging category.
Last week, the Standing Council of the State Council of China decided to extend the scope of the provisional income tax exemption for reinvestment of foreigners from encouraging foreign-investment projects to all non-prohibited projects and areas, further strengthening intellectual property protection.
The National Health and Health Committee has learned that the incidence of malnutrition among children and adolescents in China has decreased compared to decades ago, while the incidence of overweight obesity has increased significantly.
Experts have pointed out that maintaining healthy weight is the most important idea, “do not get sick,” and vigorously promote scientific fitness and rational diet.
The key to maintaining a healthy weight is a reasonable diet and scientific exercise, according to the National Health and Safety Commission’s recently published China Youth Health Education Core Information and Interpretation (2018).
Overweight, obesity and blind weight loss are not good for health.
The health hazards behind the "small fat pier" should not be ignored.
The Center for Disease Prevention Control, Nutrition and Health, China, said that overweight obesity harms the normal growth and development of adolescents, has adverse effects on their psychology, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and can even lead to high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and hyperglycemia in children.
At the same time, overweight obesity in adolescents is likely to continue into adulthood, which will increase the risk of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in adolescents after they reach adulthood.
According to the 2010-2012 nutrition and health survey of Chinese residents, China's overweight rate among children between the ages of 6 and 17 is 9.6%, obesity rate is 6.4%, and the two add up to 16%.
At the same time, the characteristics of overweight obesity among children and adolescents are that boys are more obese than girls, and urban areas are more obese than rural areas.
How do teenagers cope with overweight obesity?
Zhang Liang, deputy director of the research center for scientific fitness and health promotion of the State General Administration of Sports, said that the main reason for obesity among teenagers is over-intake of heat and lack of physical activity.
For this simple obesity, attention should be paid to scientific exercise plus reasonable diet control.
Zhang Liang pointed out that maintaining a healthy weight is the most important idea of "treatment without disease," an important part of which is to provide school, parents and students with all-round co-education, disseminate the dangers of overweight and obesity, and raise the awareness of teenagers to prevent.
Adolescents should undergo regular physical examinations, monitor growth and development indicators such as height and weight, and early discovery and scientific determination of whether overweight and obesity problems occur, in order to take timely intervention measures.
For adolescents who are already overweight, Dr. Ding recommends that in addition to the active scientific arrangement of diet and exercise, adolescents are at a special physiological stage, and should avoid using hunger or semi- hunger therapy to control and reduce weight, and should not blindly take weight loss drugs.
Reuters, September 28 - Facebook (FB.O) said Friday that hackers stole digital login codes to access nearly 5 million user accounts, an unprecedented and most serious security vulnerability in its history.
Facebook's monthly users, over 2.2 billion, said they had not yet determined whether the attacker had misused any accounts or stolen personal information.
The company has not found the location of the hackers and is not sure whether they are targeting specific victims.
Its preliminary analysis showed that this was a large-scale attack.
At a press conference, Executive Director Zackberg called the incident “very serious.”
A spokesman for the company said his account and the account of operator Sheryl Sandberg were also affected.
Facebook shares fell 2.6% on Friday, dragging down major Wall Street indices.
U.S. lawmakers said Friday that the attack could boost the voice of outside legislation on data privacy.
“This is also embarrassing evidence that Congress needs to take action to protect the privacy and security of social media users,” Democratic Senator Mark Warner said in a statement.
Robert Chopra, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), said on Twitter that he hoped to find answers to Reuters's report on the security vulnerability.
September 30 is China's fifth martyrs' day.
On such a special day, family members of veterans of the Shonan War, representatives of members of the People's Revolutionary Party, representatives of the Hunan Veterans' House, and others from all walks of life came to the Tang People's Longevity Garden/Anti-War Theme Garden in Changsha City to participate in the 2018 Shonan Veterans' Day Collective Burial Ceremony, where 10 veterans and four veterans' companions were buried.
“The veterans of the war are witnesses of the war in China, and they are a real, vivid, and clear textbook of patriotism.”
Liu Xiao, former vice-chairman of the Hunan People's Political Committee, said that the courageous and fearless anti-war veterans and my patriotic spirit are precious spiritual treasures for the contemporary people.
In a speech, the Vice-Chairman of the Changsha City People's Coordination Committee and the Chairman of the Changsha Municipal People's Coordination Committee, Zhu Jianjun, said that in recent years, the "Caring for the War Veterans" project has become an excellent brand in the work of Changsha Citizens' Coordination and Social Services by providing care services to the war veterans through life support, free pensions, free burials, etc.
He believes that only by keeping history in mind can the anti-war spirit be passed down.
At 11 o'clock in the morning, in the solemn and heavy sound of music, the people who came to participate in the activities stood up.
The members of the Chinese ceremonial team, dressed in costumes, embraced flowers, and marched in an orderly line to send 10 other anti-war veterans and 4 anti-war veterans' companions.
The participants offered flowers to the veterans, and many children joined their parents in paying homage to the war heroes.
The first national memorial garden with an anti-war theme was created in 2014 by the Changsha Municipality of People's Movement and Hunan Tang People's Universal Garden Co., Ltd.
The first phase of the memorial garden covers more than 2,000 square meters and consists of sections such as the "Heroic Monument", "Victory Square" and "Anti-War Heroes Memorial Garden".
The "Warrior Heroes' Cemetery" is a free cemetery for Shonan war heroes, and has been hailed as "the last camp of the war veterans."
Each year, before and after the National Day, the cemetery hosts large public ceremonies and burials.
Since 2015, there have been seven mass burials of anti-war veterans, and 102 anti-war veterans and their companions have slept there.
The newly revised Regulations for the Regulations for the Navigation of the Three Gorges-Guzhou Dam Water Resources Network (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations for the Navigation) will be officially implemented on October 1st. Three Gorges helicopters will be officially scheduled with the port gates after two years of pilot operation.
On the first day of implementation of the new regulations, traffic in the Three Gorges-Guzhou Dam waters is in good order.
The Yangtze River Three Gorges Administration issued its first safety inspection plan at 21pm on 30 September and inspected 160 ships, with 124 ships certified for safety inspection.
At 14 a.m. on 1 October, the navigation department arranged the first crossing plan after the new regulations were implemented.
Following the implementation of the new regulations, the safety inspection plan is issued once a day at 9:00 and 21:00 respectively, and the dam crossing plan is issued once a day at 14:00 and 20:00 respectively, allowing ships to flexibly arrange the dam crossing plan.
The Ordering Regulations add the principle of "classification control" to the ordering of ships crossing dams. The priority order of ships crossing dams is specified according to the positioning of the gates and lifts respectively, and the short-line passenger ships crossing dams are adjusted to the same priority order as the demonstration ships and honest ships.
This is also the two-year anniversary of the elevator's trial operation, and is formally scheduled in unison with the gate.
For the first time, the demonstration vessels of the River Gang and Three Gorges Reservoir Area and the new power vessels have been placed on the priority list.
Meanwhile, the Adjustment Regulations adjust the "adjustment management waterway" from the previous 180 km of dam waterway to 541.8 km of Yangtze River bridge from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishuo River Bridge, and divide it into "core waterway, dam waterway, control waterway, adjustment waterway."
This move is beneficial for the shipowner to choose suitable water area for locking and reduce the accumulation pressure of dam area for locking ships.
In accordance with the current characteristics of ships crossing dams and waiting for gates, the Regulations also put forward measures to restrict the integrity of ships that violate the regulations by cancelling declarations and delaying the crossing of dams for 24 hours.
After the storage of water in the Three Gorges, the conditions of navigation in the reservoir area were improved, which promoted the rapid development of the Yangtze River shipping.
According to the data, the annual cargo throughput of the Three Gorges and Guzhou Dams increased from 34.3 million tonnes in 2004 to 1.38 billion tonnes in 2017 and 1.4 billion tonnes in 2017.
The three-channel helicopter was tested for two years, passing through 5767 ships, carrying 16.2 million passengers, and carrying 17.2 million tons of cargo.
According to Chen Huangyuan, deputy director of the Three Gorges Transportation Authority, the Regulations have a positive role to play in promoting trustworthy over-locking management, maintaining the order of traffic between the two dams' hubs, removing the pressure on ships in the dam area and increasing the capacity for traffic.

With the approval of Premier Li Keqiang, the State Council issued the Decision on further reduction of industrial product production license management catalogues and simplified approval and approval procedures.
The Decision proposes to further reduce the directory for the management of industrial product production permits, to abolish the management of 14 categories of industrial product production permits, and to assign the authority for the management of 4 categories of industrial product production permits to the quality and technical supervision departments of the provincial people's governments.
Following the reform, industrial product production license management products will be reduced from last year's 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The Decision explicitly implements simplified approval and approval procedures for products in the catalogue.
First, the product inspection prior to issuance by the organization of the issuing authority is replaced by the product inspection conformity report issued by the inspection inspection body with qualifications submitted by the enterprise at the time of application.
Secondly, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the licensed products implemented by the quality technology supervisory department (market supervision and supervision department) of the provincial people's government shall be subject to post-site inspection.After submitting applications and product inspection certificates and making commitments to guarantee product quality safety, enterprises may obtain a production license through formal inspection and then undertake on-site inspection within the prescribed time.
Thirdly, in accordance with the principle of "one enterprise, one certificate", when applying for a new permit or applying for a replacement permit, the enterprises shall review the issue of a permit together.
The Decision calls on the regions and relevant departments to step up their efforts to reduce the catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the efforts of enterprises to publicize their commitments and carry out on-the-spot inspections, strengthen credit supervision and constraint measures, implement enterprises' primary responsibility for quality, and revoke production licenses for false commitments and non-compliance with requirements.
With regard to the abolition of the management of production permits for industrial products, the supervision of products involving public health and safety, environmental protection, etc. should be strengthened in practice. Products can be converted into compulsory certification, positive lists should be made available to the public, standards of certification should be harmonized, testing projects should be rationally reduced, and the cost of compulsory certification should be borne by the system at all levels.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification, promote the establishment of brands and expand the market.
To standard international advanced standards and promote industrial product quality improvement.
Fully play the role of third party social organizations to ensure the safety of industrial product quality.
To maintain industrial product production license management products, it is necessary to improve the standard system, play the industry supervisory advantage, strengthen the "who approves and who supervises" responsibility, dynamically evaluate the safety risks of product quality, timely reduce the catalogue, defer approval and approval authority or turn to certification management.
China's overall PMI rise in September Manufacturing's PMI dropped.
In September, China’s combined PMI output index stood at 54.1%, up 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points from last month’s and the same year’s average, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on 30 September, indicating that Chinese firms’ overall production and operational activities remained stable.
During the month, the manufacturing output index and non-manufacturing business activity index, which constitute the integrated PMI output index, fell one-up one-down, respectively, by 53.0 per cent and 54.9 per cent.
Among them, China’s manufacturing PMI was 50.8%, down 0.5 percentage points from the previous round.
Zhao Qingcheng said this month's manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
First, the basic aspects of manufacturing are generally stable.
Among the 21 industries surveyed, PMIs in 14 industries were located in the expansion zone, with manufacturing PMIs in medicine, specialty equipment, electrical and mechanical equipment, among others, running at a higher level of 53.5 per cent and growing faster.
Secondly, there is a slight fluctuation in supply and demand.
The production index and the new order index were 53.0% and 52.0%, respectively, down 0.3 and 0.2 percentage points from last month, while supply and demand remained economically stable, but expansion slowed slightly.
The new export order index and import index were 48.0% and 48.5%, lower than last month's 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively, and the economy fell to its lowest level in the year.
Fourth, the cost of enterprise raw materials procurement increases.
The acquisition price index for major raw materials was 59.8%, up 1.1 percentage points from the previous month, and the factory price index was 54.3%, the highest in the year compared to the previous month.
Fifthly, large enterprises are running well, and small enterprises continue to improve their operations.
PMI for large enterprises was 52.1%, up from last month, which has always been in the expansion zone of 52.0% or more since this year, and the rise in both the production index and the new order index cycle this month was the main driver of continued expansion in manufacturing; PMI for medium-sized enterprises was 48.7%, down from 1.7 percentage points last month, in the contraction zone; and PMI for small enterprises was 50.4%, up from 0.4 percentage points last month, rising for two consecutive months.
That month, China’s non-manufacturing business activity index rose by 0.7 percentage points from last month to 54.9%, a two-month rise.
Zhao Qingcheng believes that non-manufacturing in general continues to maintain steady and positive development momentum.
The business activity index of road transport, securities, real estate and other industries continued to be below the critical point and the total volume of business decreased.
LONDON, November 5 (LETA) - Japan's central bank, which is aware that long-term super-easy monetary policy could squeeze financial institutions' profit margins and undermine the stability of the country's banking system, President Hideo Hideohiko said Monday.
But he said that, given the sluggish inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank needed to maintain its massive stimulus plan while paying close attention to the pros and cons of its policy.
“The Bank of Japan fully recognizes that the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected by continued monetary easing,” Mr. Hida said in a speech to business leaders in Nagoya.
If financial institutions take risks more actively to compensate for the effects of years of low interest rates on profit shrinking, he said, the banking system could be in turmoil once a serious negative impact occurs.
“While these risks are not great at present, central banks will closely monitor developments and encourage financial institutions to take the necessary measures,” he said.
Earlier Monday, a record of the meeting of the Bank of Japan showed that at its September meeting, the Policy Committee discussed the rising costs of long-term easing.
If the economy continues to expand, “there will be more policy flexibility in the future,” one member said, according to meeting records.
Another member said the committee should discuss how long the ECB could sustain its stimulus policy, given its limitations over the policy's duration, according to meeting records.
The central bank will assess the financial risks arising from the austerity policy, while also considering uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic outlook, which could affect global demand due to trade frictions between the US and China and rising protectionism, Mr. Hida said.
“The impact of such problems on Japan’s economy is temporarily limited,” said Mr. Hida.
“However, the impact on the Japanese economy may be greater,” he added.
“It is necessary to pursue a strong monetary easing policy in a sustained manner, while taking into account positive and negative effects in a balanced way,” said Mr. Hida.
Despite a growing number of drawbacks to the radical stimulus plan, such as long-term low interest rates eroding financial institutions’ profits, low inflation has forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained monetary policy last month; in the face of the risks posed by the end of the global trade war, Hideo Hideo has ruled out the possibility of a near-term interest rate hike.
On June 1, 2018, Cardiff, U.S., marked Tesla's electric vehicle.
Under a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors and its CEO, Mark, have agreed to each pay $20 million in fines to financial regulators, and Mark will step down as chairman of Tesla Motors but remain CEO.
The settlement will mark a two-month period of turmoil for Tesla.
Investors will be relieved by the securities fraud allegations settlement agreement released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday.
Investors were initially worried that the long-running legal battle would only further hit the still-losing electric car company.
The SEC on Thursday sued Mack for fraud, saying its August 7 deductions mislead investors.
It is speculated that he is considering privatising Tesla for $420 a share and has been financed.
The SEC says these speculations are in fact unfounded and have caused market turmoil to the detriment of investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts say the deal could strengthen Tesla, which has been hit hard by recent moves in Moscow.
Steven Heim, head of Boston Common's asset management, said the settlement agreement should give Maxk more control, without taking "destructive" measures to get him out of Tesla.
The asset management company holds shares in Tesla's battery maker Panasonic.
Under the proposed agreement, Tesla would have to appoint an independent chairman, two independent directors, and a board of directors to develop control over Moscow's external communications.
“The matter will be resolved quickly in accordance with the agreed terms, in the best interests of our markets and our investors, including Tesla shareholders,” SEC Chairman Clinton said in a statement.
The allegations on Thursday caused Tesla's market value to evaporate to about $70 billion, down from $45 billion for General Motors on Friday.
Securities and Exchange (SEC) in the settlement agreement withdraws the demand that Mack be removed from the company's seat.
Many investors say the punishment will be catastrophic.
“I think it’s the best possible outcome for all those involved,” said Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners, who gave Tesla a “neutral” rating and called the SEC’s punishment “from light punishment” to Marks.
“He’s still an important CEO for Tesla.”
Marks and Tesla neither acknowledged nor denied the SEC's allegations in the settlement agreement, nor immediately responded to the review request.
The settlement agreement still needs to be ratified by the courts.
Beijing Morning News (Reporter Wang Ping) The Beijing Morning News reporter learned from Beijing Construction Group that one of the core building blocks in the 2019 Beijing World Gardens Park, the Beijing World Gardens Performing Arts Square Project, will for the first time use multicoloured ETFE pictorial membrane structures. The 5440 square meter membrane structure will be in six colors: deep red, deep green, orange, blue, red, and green, and will show "butterfly wing" patterns under the stretch of the lasso steel wire.
According to Liu Changbo, the project manager of Beijing Construction Five Construction Group, the construction area of the Performing Arts Square project is 4,500 square meters, installed with a total steel consumption of 1,182 tons, and the steel structure roof is supported by a suspension steel truss with 26 umbrella-shaped padding.
“From the sky overlooking the Performing Arts Square, the colourful roofs look like flowering and dancing butterflies, and the colours do not fade away with time and frost and snow.”
Previously, monochrome ETFE membrane structures were widely used in bird nests, water squares, etc., but multi-coloured ETFE membrane structures are the first in the country.
Journalists learned that because there are few suppliers worldwide with the ability to produce multi-colour membrane structures, every inch of membrane structure material is “precious.”
Liu said that in order to avoid problems of overlapping and "fighting" at the end of the socket, he will also innovate by using a "double fork" socket structure to ensure that the "fighting" socket converges in the right position by means of a special fixed plug.
The construction of the 2019 Beijing World Gardens Park is currently underway.
Among them, the International Museum Project has completed the suspension of all the umbrellas.
The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of October.

Shinzo Abe proposes to leave Ghandi as the Liberal Party's chief minister Cabinet restructuring and other discussions have come to an end - ChinaNet
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has entered the final phase of discussions on the two-day cabinet restructuring and the party's top-level personnel adjustment, the Associated Press reported on Monday (October 1).
Coordination is currently under way to get Abe to become the party’s four most important candidates for election as chairman of the counter-measures committee or chairman-in-chief of the general affairs committee, in charge of former economic regeneration for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Political figures reportedly disclosed the news on 1 January.
Abe held talks with the leader of the Kuomintang party, Natsuo Yamaguchi, at his office in the afternoon.
Yamaguchi demanded that the land transportation minister from the Kuomintang Party, Mr. Ishii, remain in office.
Abe said he would “discuss.”
Yamaguchi revealed this to the media.
Abe met at his official residence at noon on January 1 with the Liberal Democratic Party vice-president, Masahiko Takamura, to ask for a constitutional amendment “with the hope that help will continue in the future.”
Gaomura is currently the party's special adviser for the constitutional advancement of the headquarters.

Shanghai, Sept. 30 (LETA) - The revised Companies Regulatory Guidelines (CSR) were officially released on Sunday, focusing on strengthening the constraints on holding shareholders, actual controllers and their associates, paying greater attention to the protection of small and medium-sized investors, and playing the role of a protective body for small and medium-sized investors, while actively drawing on international experience to encourage institutional investors to participate in corporate governance.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notes that the revised guidelines cover the basic philosophy and principles of the governance of listed companies, the composition and operation of shareholders' meetings, boards of directors and supervisory boards, the rights and obligations of directors, supervisors and senior managers, the incentive and constraint mechanisms of listed companies, and the codes of conduct of holding shareholders and their associates.
The new guidelines also include the participation of institutional investors and related institutions in corporate governance, the basic requirements of listed companies in respect of stakeholders, environmental protection and social responsibility, as well as disclosure and transparency of information.
The revised guidelines require listed companies to implement the philosophy of innovation, coordination, green, open, and shared development in corporate governance, increase the requirement for party formation of listed companies, and strengthen the leading role of listed companies in environmental protection and social responsibility.
Strengthen the role of the Board of Directors' Audit Committee and establish the basic framework for disclosure of environmental, social responsibilities and corporate governance (ESG) information.
In addition to responding to the concerns of the parties, the new guidelines also put forward new demands on the stability of control over the governance of listed companies, the performance of independent directors, the high evaluation and incentive constraint mechanism of the board of directors of listed companies, and the strengthening of disclosure of information.

China's President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China's open doors will not close only the bigger they go, and that the steps towards higher levels of openness will not stop.
Expanding imports is not an equity measure, but a long-term perspective, with Chinese imports of goods and services expected to exceed $30 trillion and $10 trillion in the next 15 years, respectively.
Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the first China International Import Expo, saying that China would further reduce tariffs, speed up the development of new industries such as cross-border retailers, continue to liberalize market access, promote the opening up of services, and liberalize foreign equity ratios in areas such as education and health care, where the domestic market lacks a large gap.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign enterprises.
He said that China would press ahead with studies to propose a step-by-step approach to the establishment of a free trade port policy and system in Hainan, accelerate the exploration of the process of building a free trade port with Chinese characteristics, add new zones to the Shanghai Self-Trade Zone, set up a committee board at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and launch a pilot registration system to support the integration of the Yangtze River Delta region, and elevate it to a national strategy.
"China's economy is a sea, not a small pond.
When there is calm and wind, there is a storm,” Xi said. “A storm can overwhelm a small pond, but it cannot overwhelm the sea.
Having experienced countless storms and thunderstorms, the sea is still there!
After 5,000 years of hardship, China is still there!
Looking to the future, China will always be here! "
He pointed out that economic globalization was hit by a wave, multilateralism and the free trade system were hit, instability and uncertainty remained high, and risk challenges were exacerbated. Open cooperation was an important driving force for strengthening international economic and trade cooperation, and countries should insist on open integration, expand mutually beneficial development space and strengthen macroeconomic coordination.
He stressed once again that China's open doors will not close, but that the bigger they go, the higher the pace of opening up will not stop.
China will stimulate import potential and take more active and effective measures in line with the trend of domestic consumption upgrading to promote the increase in income of residents and foster high-end consumption growth points.
China will respect international business practices and treat all types of enterprises registered in China equally and equally.
China will protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-invested enterprises, resolutely punish violations of the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-invested enterprises in accordance with law, especially violations of intellectual property rights, improve the quality and efficiency of intellectual property review, introduce punitive compensation system, and significantly increase the illegal cost.
Speaking about the outlook for China's economy, Xi said that economic growth, employment, prices, international receipts, corporate profits, fiscal revenues, labor productivity, and other key indicators were in reasonable range and laid an important foundation for achieving the targets for the year.
Compared to other major economies, China's economic growth remains at the forefront of the world.
“There has been no change in the basics of China’s economic development and health and stability, in the conditions of the production components that support China’s economy, and in the overall trend toward good in the long term.”
Xi said everyone can be optimistic about China's economic development prospects.
Xi said that China's macro-regulatory capacity has been steadily strengthened and has many favourable conditions for maintaining the long-term healthy and stable development of the economy. China's current economic development has also encountered prominent contradictions and problems, and measures are being taken to actively address them, and the results have already and are showing.
“We believe that China’s economy will be able to accelerate its transition to a better-functioning economy as long as it maintains its strategic stability, opens up its markets and addresses the outstanding contradictions and problems that exist under atmospheric pressure,” Xi said.

Indonesia's death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis rose to 420 without reports of Chinese civilians
The death toll from the massive earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia, has risen to 420 people, according to the Indonesian government's Disaster Management Department's Wilem Rampangilei, who was quoted as saying at midnight local time on 29 November.
The official said it was only statistics from the city of Palo, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, which did not include the Donggala county and the nearby Sigi area, where communications were still interrupted and reports of casualties had not yet been received.
As many roads in the city of Palau were severely damaged, heavy machinery was difficult to enter and the search and rescue work was very difficult.
In order to ensure rescue, all commercial flights were suspended after the airport reopened on the night of 28 and the flights from Jakarta to Paro were cancelled that night.
Following the earthquake and tsunami, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia was able to verify the situation of Chinese citizens in the affected areas through various channels.
So far, no reports of civilian casualties have been received.
"The ultrasonic project is being carried out as planned by the International Group and under a contract signed with the Ministry of Trade and Industry," said Sergei Sepalov, president of the Russian Central Institute of Aerodynamics in Yugoslavia.
We believe it will take two to three years to demonstrate the technology, and another 10 to 15 years to achieve mass production of civilian aircraft.
The current problem facing Russian scientists is how to combine the economics and safety of aircraft, said Serpalo.
He said ultrasonic aircraft are characterized by huge noise impacts.
The institute is working with the Moscow Academy of Aviation and the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop a full range of civilian ultrasonic aircraft, including public and large-scale passenger aircraft for commercial transportation, he said.
The Chinese government has made a very important speech at the private enterprise symposium to inject firm confidence into the broader stage of the private sector economy.
Emphasizing that "Let entrepreneurs unload their burdens of thought and lighten their suits to move forward," the Chinese Prime Minister urged strong sympathy among the large number of entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market dynamism comes from people, especially from entrepreneurs, from the entrepreneurial spirit.
In the course of 40 years of reform and opening-up, there are tens of millions of entrepreneurs entrepreneurial innovation stories, the entrepreneurs' group has grown enormously, constantly pushing the Chinese economy to the brink of bankruptcy.
For some time now, there have been people in society who have spoken out against and questioned the private economy.
Misconceptions such as the so-called “private-economy off-the-field” and “new public-private partnership” have raised doubts and concerns among some entrepreneurs.
Recently, some private enterprises have encountered many difficulties and problems in their business development.
For example, changes in the international economic environment have had an impact on some exporting enterprises; rapid adjustment of demand structures has brought pressure to restructure; some policies are inconsistent with each other, policy effects overlap with each other, or the way things work is simple, resulting in some initially good policies having the opposite effect, and so on.
Various factors are intertwined, the private sector economy is facing difficulties, some private enterprises are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Against this background, correcting the misunderstandings, removing the burden of entrepreneurs' thinking, giving enterprises a focus on development, the government a focus on promoting development, and concerning market confidence and development expectations have a particularly profound practical significance.
This symposium once again emphasizes the important conclusion that "three have not changed": "The status and role of the non-public-owned economy in our country's economic and social development has not changed!"
In recent years, the Party Central Committee has given an unprecedented amount of attention to entrepreneurs and institutional safeguards, ranging from profoundly promoting the simplification of administration and the establishment of a list of powers system to creating the rule of law environment to protect the legitimate and legitimate rights and interests of entrepreneurs, creating a fair competition market environment, and creating an atmosphere of respect for entrepreneurs throughout society.
Moreover, the symposium explicitly proposes six policy measures to support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and launches a series of practical actions dedicated to the "lightweight march" of SMEs.
These all give great encouragement to the entrepreneurial community and give the community more expectation.
The fog is cleared, the direction is set, and the key is to implement.
We must constantly create a better development environment for the private sector economy, help private enterprises to solve the difficulties of development, and help to realize the restructuring of the Chinese economy; we must make entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legitimate operations, feel respect in social life, stimulate innovative dynamism and create potential.
China's economy needs more entrepreneurs to show ambition in the process of moving towards China's new economy. It also provides more space and stage for entrepreneurs to play their creative role.
We have reason to believe that with further deepening of reforms and removal of obstacles, the private sector economy will have better prospects for development and opportunities to move towards a wider stage.
Online Verification of 46 Regulatory Certificates for Inner Mongolia Import and Export - China New Network
Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (China Customs and Excise Department) - Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (China Customs and Excise Department) - Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (China Customs and Excise Department) - Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (China Customs and Excise Department) - Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (China Customs and Excise Department) - Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department
The enterprises in Inner Mongolia can declare the relevant documents to the Customs in paperless manner, avoiding the past on-site rush, paper application, duplication of submission and so on.
It is well-known that the preparation time for the various kinds of certificates required for import and export before the declaration of trade is a major factor that affects the overall time of trade. In order to reduce the time of trade and reduce the cost of trade, it is necessary to reduce the time of trade.
Previously, there were 86 types of regulatory certificates required for customs inspection and verification in the import and export sectors, covering 19 departments.
According to the report, according to the principle of "can be cancelled, can be merged, can be withdrawn from the port inspection, can be withdrawn from the port inspection", based on the "Single Window" platform for international trade, the Customs and other 16 issuing agencies' systems of interconnection and data interconnection, achieved data multi-track, enterprise small-track.
The Customs said that in the past, enterprises had to come back and forth to departmental offices to submit paper applications, the process was long and could not track the audit status in real time.
Business users can now login directly to the Single Window portal website and apply online.
After the certification department has passed the examination, the electronic data of the certificate is transmitted to the Customs, and the customs reporting data is automatically matched and intelligently verified. The results of the examination are unified by means of "single window" feedback to enterprises, and the entire process of the supervision certificate declaration, audit, customs and feedback is handled on-line.
Korea's chicken soup exports to China surged 20 times over 4 years or related to an increase in the youth of empty nests - China-China.net
South Korean chicken soup exports to China increased 20 times in 4 years Analysis: Increase in the number of empty nest youths
South Korea's exports of chicken soup to China last year exceeded $1 million, nearly 20 times as high as in 2013 four years ago, the Korean news agency reported on Friday.
Analysts believe that this increase is related to the increase in the popularity of convenience foods in China and to the increase in the attention of young people to nutritional foods.
The data was released by the South Korean Agricultural and Aquaculture Food Distribution Corporation (aT) on May 5.
Last year, South Korea’s exports of chicken soup to China amounted to $10.039 million, weighing 21.59 million kilograms, an increase of 2094% and 366.8%, respectively, from 2013.
According to the analysis, the increase in sales of Korean sausage soup in China is related to the increase in the popularity of convenience food among empty nest youth, as well as to the increase in young people's attention to nutritional foods.
As of this year, China’s households have surpassed 200 million outlets and are expected to grow to 30% of the total population by 2020, and local food companies are aiming to introduce convenience foods to the “single food family.”
In addition, the analysis also indicates that avian flu is the biggest obstacle to the Chinese mainland market for chicken soup.
According to aT, an outbreak of avian flu in South Korea between November 2016 and April last year resulted in a total ban on exports of chicken soup to China, resulting in a sharp drop in exports.
In 2016, chicken soup exports to China reached $8.4 million, while last year exports plummeted to $1 million due to avian flu.

Celebrating National Day with Flag Raising Ceremony at Kawaguchi Port on the China-China Border
“It would be more shocking to see such a magnificent ceremony on the frontier than to watch a ceremony on the mainland.”
Mr. Zhang, who travelled from Sichuan to the Yunnan River mouth at the border with China and Vietnam, and more than 500 soldiers, residents and foreign tourists attended the flag-raising ceremony to celebrate the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
River mouth is the largest port in the Yunnan section of the border between China and Vietnam, located in River mouth county of Red River province of Yunnan province, opposite the river in Vietnam's Old Street city, and belongs to a class of state ports.
As China connects Southeast Asia with one of the most convenient channels, the flow of entry and exit from the river mouth ports has grown steadily with the deepening of the National Belt and Road Strategy.
At 7:30 a.m., the sun had just turned a corner, and the Kawaguchi port-limited area gathered early to watch the flag-raising ceremony of Kawaguchi locals and foreign tourists.
At 7:45 p.m., the flag-raising ceremony started on time, and the members of the National Gate Guard troops at the Kawaguchi Border Inspection Station shivered, taking a steady step to escort the flag to the flag-raising platform.
After the command was given to raise the flag, the flag-raiser stretched out an arc with his arms, and the bright five-star red flag, like the Eagle's Wings, spread out its face, slowly rising with the melodies of the national anthem.
“The flag-raising ceremony of the National Day at every significant time, such as New Year’s Day, Spring Festival, and National Day, not only shows China’s image, but also inspires patriotic feelings among the peoples of the border regions.”
The soldiers of the army who attended the ceremony of raising the flag said so.
It is reported that the flag-raising team responsible for the Kawaguchi port ceremony is composed of more than 40 soldiers from various positions at the Kawaguchi border defence checkpoint, ranging from a three-man flag-raising team to a large-scale flag-raising team, which has experienced more than 60 years of history and has performed more than 70 times the national foreign affairs service mission since its formation.
The newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusts the standard of assessment for Chinese residents' taxpayers of personal income tax to 183 days after the end of the year.
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new Personal Income Tax Act will be to consider continuing to make preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong and Macau, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation said on 30 July.
The person in charge said that the current Ordinance implementing the Personal Income Tax Act provides special preferential provisions for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived there for more than five years, and whose income comes from outside China, may pay personal income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
Parts paid outside China do not need to pay personal income tax within China.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the State Commission for Development and Cooperation, and the Ministry of Commerce of China also issued notices extending the scope of application of the policy of not levying advance income tax on foreign investors to distribute profits from direct investments.
The profits allocated to overseas investors from enterprises resident in China shall be used for the purpose of applying the policy of temporarily not imposing pre-taxation on domestic direct investment and shall be extended from foreign investment-encouraging projects to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and areas.
During the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive information on the Korean Peninsula.
South Korea’s President Wen Jiabao has reaffirmed the North’s “unreversible” resolve to abandon nuclear weapons and said US President Donald Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end of this year.
The U.S. State Department subsequently said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would visit North Korea in October to promote the implementation of the promises made by US leaders in Singapore.
Since the beginning of this year, the DPRK has broken the deadlock in opening the way for dialogue, the leaders of the DPRK and the U.S. have met, the trend of calming the situation on the peninsula has continued, and the principle of dialogue in resolving the peninsula problem has been upheld.
First, “the essence of the peninsula problem is a security problem.” The key to peace on the peninsula is a proper, balanced solution to the legitimate security concerns of the good parties, rather than one-sided pressure on each other and one-sided emphasis on one’s own claims.
Second, in the dialogue to achieve the denuclearization of the Peninsula, the steps and modalities for achieving denuclearization of the Peninsula differ widely, and, owing to the long-standing lack of political trust between the US and the US, the “who wins first and who loses second” game mentality remains strong.
At the Council’s open-ended meeting on the Korean Peninsula, held at UN headquarters in New York a few days ago, different voices around the issue of sanctions against North Korea have once again highlighted that the two “unchanged” points on the issue have not changed.
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Russian Foreign Minister Vladimir Lavrov, meanwhile, emphasized the principle of “response to action by action,” stating that “the weakening trend of sanctions should be in line with the pace of North Korea’s gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons.”
There is no doubt that the parties concerned should continue to implement the Council's interim resolutions in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner, but pressure is not an end in itself, and the implementation of sanctions and the promotion of political settlements are all requirements of the Council's resolutions, neither of which can be overlooked nor chosen.
As China's State Secretary and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the current positive developments in relations between North Korea and the United States, China believes that it is necessary for the Council to consider the timely launch of reversible clauses, thereby encouraging North Korea and the parties concerned to take greater steps towards non-nuclearization.
Recalling the past, every progress in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires sufficient political courage on the part of the parties.
At present, in the face of the increasing expectations of the international community to promote the political settlement of the peninsula problem, the parties concerned, in particular, should show political courage, make political decisions, implement their commitments, resolve difficulties, continue to move in a positive direction, promote the process of denuclearization of the peninsula and establish the peninsula peace mechanism, and jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
The people's government of Ji County, Linfen City, Shanxi Province, reported on Monday that the Huangcheng Waterfall scenic area in the county will maintain relatively high water levels during National Day and will not have open conditions.
To ensure safety, the scenic areas are temporarily closed during National Day.
Yellow River Pothole Waterfall is the second largest waterfall in China and the largest yellow waterfall in the world.
The stone walls on both sides of the Yellow River are steep, and the mouth of the river is narrow as a pothole, forming the appearance of "one pothole of the Yellow River a thousand miles away".
According to reporters, June–October is the Yellow River flood season, starting from July 12, 2018, because of the high water level of the Yellow River, Shanxi Yellow River Kingkou scenic area began to close gradually, so Kingkou scenic area closed cumulatively for nearly a month.
“This is the longest continuous high-water level in the Yellow River for nearly 20 years,” said Niu Feng, general engineer of the Kokkou Scenic Area Authority, to the media. “We closed the flood season in 2017 for four days, and this year for nearly a month.”
It is known that in order to meet the Golden Week of the Eleventh, the Shanxi Huang River Waterfall Scenic Area had already put in place an advance staffing arrangement and vehicle maintenance, and even temporary staffing.
According to the "Notice Concerning the Prevention of Floods in the Yellow River during National Day", issued by the Office of the Directorate-General for Drought Prevention and Control of the Yellow River Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is requested that Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Provinces do their best to prevent floods in the Yellow River during National Day.
Currently, the flow of the Yellow River dry river is large, the flow of the upper river is maintained at 2000–3000 square meters per second, the flow of the middle river is maintained at 2500–3500 square meters per second, and the flow of the lower river is maintained at 3000 square meters per second.
Health Centres and Health Stations provide flu vaccination services especially on National Day Holidays
This year, the HA has ordered 150,000 doses of flu vaccine for 2018-2019 at four-year prices. In order to facilitate the availability of flu vaccine during public holidays, the HA Health Centres and Health Stations provide immunization services from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on National Day Holidays (October 1 and 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, after the introduction of the scheme, the Health Bureau's Health Centres and Health Stations have extended the time for vaccination from Monday to Friday to 8:00 p.m., and as of 4:00 p.m. on September 30, 4,158 people have been vaccinated, up from 3,714 in the same period last year.
The free vaccination targets include Macao residents aged 6 months to 18 years, 50 years and over, pregnant women, all chronically ill persons, including obese persons (i.e. those with a body mass index BMI of 30 or more), and staff in institutions, kindergartens, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, all health workers, and Macao residents working in gambling establishments.
At the same time, other persons considered necessary for vaccination, including the public sector, will be arranged by the Centre of Health after contacting the relevant agencies for a list.
In order to facilitate vaccinators and reduce waiting times for vaccination, the HA will dispatch medical personnel to Hong Kong Secondary Schools, Primary Schools, Kindergartens and Nursing Homes from October to December this year to collect influenza vaccines for infants, junior and junior high school students, teachers and staff. In addition, the HA will arrange for staff to collect vaccines for elderly people and disabled persons in institutions, larger public sectors and other institutions.
Students and infants unable to participate in a collective vaccination may take their Macao resident identity card, Health Bureau user card, influenza vaccine vaccination card (if any), student card, employee card or professional certificate to the Geneva Integrated Hospital vaccination station or Health Centre from 3 December 2018.
The Health Bureau reminded residents that those who had taken the 2017-2018 influenza vaccine between September 2017 and August 2018 would still need to take a new seasonal influenza vaccine from September 2018, as the influenza antigens contained in the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine have been updated to address the Northern Hemisphere 2018-2019 winter and 2019 summer seasonal influenza.
The peak of influenza in Macao usually occurs between January and March of each year and is later than in temperate regions (such as northern China and Japan). The WHO calls for early vaccination of those at high risk of complications and those in frequent contact with those at high risk, such as elderly people, children, pregnant women, obese people and chronic patients.

The total number of deaths could rise to thousands, said Indonesia's Vice President, Kamala.
When the waves hit the coast at midnight on Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate the holiday, and many were swept away by the waves, destroying everything where the waves arrived.
TOKYO, October 1 (LETA) - Japan's central bank on Monday released a short-term quarterly survey showing that confidence among large Japanese manufacturers reached its lowest level in more than a year in September, owing to rising raw material costs and a series of natural disasters affecting production that put firms under pressure.
The survey shows little to show that rising global trade friction is undermining confidence among large manufacturers.
But the risk of a full-scale trade war hits businesses' business prospects and may threaten their capital spending.
Active capital spending is a bright spot in the Japanese economy.
The survey questioned the Bank’s view that steady economic expansion would help drive inflation to accelerate to the 2% target, despite signs that firms are gradually transferring costs to customers.
“In a context of concern over the global trade war, confidence among manufacturers has stagnated as exports slowed and factory production weakened,” said Nan Wuzhi, a senior researcher at the Sino-China Joint Research Institute.
“Confidence is still high, and I don’t think confidence will continue to decline as profits are improving and prices are rising,” he said.
A short-term survey showed that the large-scale manufacturing sentiment index in September deteriorated from positive 21 to positive 19 three months ago, for the third consecutive quarter.
The market's estimated average value is positive 22.
For the first time in eight quarters, the large non-manufacturing sentiment index deteriorated from 24 percent in June to 22 percent in September.
The Reuters investigation was positive 22.
The survey showed that both the large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing indices were expected to remain stable in December.
Investors are not worried about the downturn in the short-term business sentiment index, as the Nikkei index .N225 rose to its 27-year high Monday, as the continued depreciation of the yen helped improve the export profitability prospects of Japanese firms.
Capital expenditure is stable.
Despite a decline in corporate confidence, the latest snapshot highlights firm capital spending plans that benefit from capacity upgrading and increased investment in robots and automation to address the labor shortage caused by population aging.
The central bank’s short-term survey shows that large-scale enterprises plan to increase capital spending by 13.4% as of March 2019.
The previous short-term survey was 13.6%.
Mr. Nam said all corporate capital spending plans for this fiscal year grew by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan's bubble economy.
“In view of the profit estimates for small-scale enterprises from now on, there is room for further growth in capital expenditures,” he said, “but this largely depends on the impact of the trade war on corporate confidence.”
An encouraging sign of Japan's progress in countering deflationary efforts is the short-term survey showing an increase in the ability of firms to transfer costs, with the output price index of large firms at positive 7, the highest in a decade.
Measuring the employment situation of large enterprises, the index hit a negative of 23, the closest level since 1992, highlighting the convergence of employment markets.
Benefiting from strong corporate spending, Japan's economy has recovered in the second quarter from a slump in January-March of this year.
But the escalation of summer trade friction and the disruption of supply chains by natural disasters have clouded the prospects for Japan’s export-dependent economy.
In dollar terms, service imports and exports grew by 16.4%.
The Ministry of Commerce's website quoted the head of the Customs and Trade Division as saying that the total volume of new services imported and exported in August-August exceeded $1 trillion and grew faster than the total.
Among them, the total import and export of emerging services grew by 29.9% to $11,383.9 billion, up 10.4 percentage points from the total growth in services import and export, and the share of emerging services increased by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service exports, services exports continued to grow rapidly this year from August 1 to 8, with exports growing by 5.7 percentage points faster than imports.
The top three areas of growth were telecommunications computer and information services, personal cultural and entertainment services, and insurance services, with growth rates of 61.1%, 38.8%, and 26.5%, respectively.
The head of the Trade and Services Division also pointed out that the import share of emerging services increased gradually in the month of August-August.
In the month of August-August, the import of emerging services grew rapidly, accounting for 23.6% of the import of services, up 1.6 percentage points from the same period last year.
Of these, imports of financial services, intellectual property usage fees, telecommunications computers and information services grew by more than 20 per cent, 47.1 per cent, 23.3 per cent and 23.2 per cent, respectively.
Messi substituted as a substitute and scored three assists in a three-game loss to Barcelona.
Last night in Barcelona's 7th-round home game against Bilbao, Demas scored a goal in the first half to lead the home team, Messi substituted in the second half to assist Munir, and both sides finished in a 1–1 draw.
The match was rescheduled for Messi and Busquets.
In the second half of the game, he was replaced by Messi.
Barcelona, which had escaped a snatch, had already lost three league rounds, neither in Real Madrid nor in a victory, and still ranked first with a net goal advantage, but only one point behind third Seville.

Happy People's National Day!
Oil prices or the "three-fold rise" National Day rides can be filled with oil in advance.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A new round of crude oil price hikes will open on September 30 at 24 o'clock in the morning, coinciding with the National Day holiday.
Several agencies have predicted a sharp rise in oil prices, leading to a “three-fold rise.”
Planning self-driving car owners can fill up their cars before the price increases.
According to the data of the Longhua Information Measurement, it is estimated that the corresponding increase in domestic crude oil is around 190 yuan/tonne; the increase in the Tableau Information Measurement is 220 yuan/tonne.
In September, oil prices had already been raised twice: on September 3, gasoline was raised to $180/tonne and diesel to $170/tonne; and on September 17, gasoline was raised to $145/tonne and diesel to $145/tonne.
Domestic oil prices are linked to international oil prices, and since the round's price cycle, international oil prices have surged, and Brent crude oil continues to rise after breaking the $80 cap.
As of September 28, the U.S. WTI crude futures rose $1.13 to $73.25 a barrel.
Brent crude futures rose by $1.0 to $82.72 a barrel.
“From the international point of view, tensions such as US sanctions against Iran have overwhelmed, and oil prices have been on the rise as a whole, followed by a clear refusal to increase production at the OPEC Conference, giving markets confidence that oil prices will move up steadily.”
Zhang Wen Gang, an oil analyst at Chongqing Information Products, said.
In the retail sector, gasoline prices at Beijing Central Oil and Petrochemical Fuel Stations 92 and 95 are 7.66 yuan/litre and 8.15 yuan/litre, respectively.
According to Li彦, an analyst at Longchang Information, the discount promotion strategy for gas station retailing has not changed much. Currently, the discount rate for major gas stations such as Petrochemical is more than 0.5-0.7 yuan/hour, while the discount rate for private gas stations is more than 0.5-1.2 yuan/hour.
“This round of retail prices is about to go up three-fold, with an increase of around $0.14-0.16, and private car owners are advised to fill up before the National Day holiday,” Li said.
Elementary school students are punished by teachers for wrong questions Disqualification of the school involved in the year - ChinatownNet
In response to the incident involving the teacher's corporal punishment of an elementary school student who made a mistake, the official microblogging message issued yesterday by the administrative board of the new district of Kawadong, Suning City, said that after investigation, the situation of the foreign language elementary school teacher RoXX corporal punishment of the student was true and had been removed from the teacher's post, and the school involved canceled the annual "Best Rating" qualification.
Parents have reported that a sixth-grade girl in Zhongning Primary School has been beaten by a class math teacher in school for doing wrong problems, causing widespread concern.
Subsequently, the social affairs bureau of the newly-established Handong district of Zhenning City established an investigative team to visit schools to investigate and inquire about relevant personnel, collect evidence on the spot, and dismiss teachers involved.
Yesterday, the official microblogging news release of the Xinjiang City River East New Area Board said that the situation of foreign language elementary school teachers in Zhejiang province RoXX corporal punishment of students has been verified.
Based on the study, the year-end assessment of foreign language elementary schools in Suzhou "one vote against," cancels the year-end "qualification of the best."
It also noted that the administrative classes of foreign-language elementary schools in Suzhou had been held to hold collective cautionary conversations, and that the management leadership and classroom supervision had been handled according to the relevant provisions; that the involved teachers had been dismissed from their teaching positions and had been treated seriously according to the relevant provisions; and that the foreign-language elementary schools in Suzhou had been ordered to carry out a thorough inspection, and to carry out activities to build up the teaching ethics of teachers, and to take practical measures to prevent such incidents from occurring again.
At the same time, the school should actively communicate with the students' parents and properly handle the follow-up work.
Opening of the 69th International Astronautical Congress in Germany - China New Net
The 69th International Astronautical Congress opened on October 1 at the Bremen Exhibition Centre, Germany, with more than 6,300 astronauts, representatives of space agencies and enterprises, experts and young students from around the world attending.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, the president of the International Aeronautics Federation, Jean-Yves Leclerc, said that the global space industry is no longer a small group of countries and institutions and that the number of attendees this year has risen dramatically from the previous one, indicating that more and more institutions and individuals are joining it.
He appealed to all countries to strengthen cooperation and innovation and jointly promote the development of the space industry.
The Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information, Secretary of State for Space, Mr Zhang Keqiang, introduced China's space programme during the exchange and said that China would expand international cooperation in the space field and contribute to the human space cause.
The meeting was attended by representatives of China Aerospace Technology Group Company, China Aerospace Engineering Group Company, etc., as well as some private enterprises, and showed the latest achievements of China Aerospace, including various types of rockets, satellites and applications of aerospace technology.
The International Astronautical Congress has been held annually since 1950 and is the world's largest aviation event.
The conference, which will be held for five days, will be jointly hosted by the International Aeronautics Federation, the International Academy of Aeronautics, the Center for Applied Sciences and Microgravity at the University of Bremen, and the International Society of Space Law.
BEIJING, November 5 (LETA) - China's Centre for Foreign Trade (CTC) published a press release on Sunday that showed that China's foreign trade situation remains complicated and severe, with 80.6% of enterprises expecting exports to be better or on par for the whole of 2018.
But taking into account the continuing rise in the cost of integrated elements such as domestic raw materials and labor, and the increased external environment with the impact of trade frictions between China and the United States, the exhibitors also believe that next year's export situation is not optimistic.
Speaking at the closing press conference of the 124th GATS, Xu Hye, Deputy Secretary-General of the GATS, spokesman for the press and deputy director of China's Centre for Foreign Trade, said that the number of overseas buyers attending the GATS and the volume of export transactions fell slightly year-on-year.
This year, 189,812 buyers from 215 countries and regions attended, down 1.11% year-on-year.
Export transactions amounted to ¥2,064.94 billion ($298.6 billion), down 1% year-on-year.
From a market perspective, transactions increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2%, and 2.5% respectively for Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, the “BRIC Four”, and South Korea, while traditional markets such as the United States, Australia, Canada, and the European Union fell by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3%, and 0.8% respectively.
In industry terms, transportation tools, mechanical equipment, construction and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods and information products, bathing equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0%, 15.1%, and 7.6% respectively, while textile clothing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Mr Xu said that as a sign of good weather for China's foreign trade, this year's WTO buyers' meetings and export transaction data show that China's foreign trade development will still face many uncertain uncertainties next year.
But with the deepening of structural reforms on the supply side, as well as the recent policy measures such as the "six-seat" have been adopted at national and local level, China's foreign trade development is accelerating the accumulation of new dynamics and the diversification of enterprise markets is making new progress. These are important foundations and strong conditions for foreign trade development.
"It is expected that China's foreign trade and imports and exports will continue to grow steadily throughout the year, with further improvements in quality and efficiency," Xu said.
The Chinese Customs Department announced a 14.5% increase in exports in September, 14.3% increase in imports, and a trade surplus of $316.9 billion in September, the highest since February.
Despite the escalation of trade frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September remained well above expectations, and strong external demand, corporate rush to export before tariffs were imposed in the United States, coupled with the devaluation of the renminbi's exchange rate, or other major supporting factors, showed some degree of resilience in China's foreign trade. But the impact of the trade war between China and the United States on confidence and on the chain of industries cannot be overlooked, and analysts believe that the challenges for China's foreign trade may emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
A Reuters survey showed that U.S. fund managers in September suggested raising cash holdings and continued to be cautious, as the US and China began the latest round of reciprocal import tariffs and there was no sign of a slowdown in the dispute.
But, according to the 12 fund managers involved in the survey, North America’s asset allocations rose to their highest since June 2017, while stocks in the UK and the eurozone, especially emerging markets, declined.
Global equity allocations averaged 56.6%, and bonds 35.5%, which is essentially the same as last month’s survey.
The most obvious change is that the cash ratio has risen to 5.1%, the highest since December 2014.
“Some economic data have brought confidence to the markets,” said a fund manager at a large fund company, “but trade wars are still the biggest concern, so it’s best to be ready to go when the markets are down.”
But fund managers still favoured stocks in September, especially US stocks, even though US stocks were considered too high.
Today, China’s open-air Shanghai exhibition, the world’s first large-scale national exhibition on imports – the China International Import Expo – officially opens in the eye of the public.
An exhibition is like a window that allows the world to better understand a city and a country.
Through this “window” of the Expo, one sees a higher-level “opening up” of China; through this “window” of the Expo, one welcomes the world’s mutual gains with China’s “restarting from reform and opening up.”
“For a country, openness is like breaking cocoons into butterflies, which, though painful for a while, will be reborn.”
In his conclusions on the road to openness, Xi Jinping gave an important reason why China can.
Recalling the 40 years of reform and opening-up, China has dared to enter the world market in the ocean of whirlwinds and waves, but has always faced all the risk challenges in an open stance, constantly releasing the intrinsic dynamics, constantly improving the competitive ability.
It can be said that China uses its own real achievements to emphasize the value and significance of openness.
Standing on a new historical starting point, organizing an exhibition with the theme of imports is a major decision taken by China's central party, which is centered on Comrade Xi Jinping, to promote a new round of high-level openness to the world. It is a major initiative of China to open up the world's markets. It is a concrete step in China's support for economic globalization and trade liberalization.
And national exhibitors are eager to sign up for the “one-size-fits-all” booth, which is China’s greatest affirmation and best response to developing an open economy in a broader, broader, and deeper sphere.
More importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crossroads.
Some countries have built up high walls of trade protectionism and retreated from the old path of unilateralism, raising international concerns about the prospects of free trade and adding uncertainty to the global economy that is warming.
Against this backdrop, the event on the Huangpu River reflects China’s defence of free trade, allowing the world to see open markets, share China’s confidence in the future, and China’s responsibility.
Walk fast, walk far.
China’s open-hearted embrace of the world has not only strengthened its own development, but has also brought tremendous “China’s opportunities” to the world and regions.
In recent years, China has been advocating and promoting the creation of the Belt and Road corridor, the establishment of sub-investment banks, and the establishment of the Silk Road Fund. China has provided a series of international public goods, providing real export markets, development opportunities, and jobs, and enabling enterprises to take advantage of China’s “fast-track” and “fast-track” developments.
Expo is also such a public product, a great platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
Over this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions, with each characteristic high-quality products and services shining on the scene, take a new step in the Chinese market.
In addition to national enterprises, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building this platform of "best choice best way forward," it provides a high-quality supply of many channels for the upgrading of consumption, satisfying the individualized, diversified and differentiated consumption demands of the people.
With the opening of China's doors, the flow of goods, the use of goods, and the steps towards a better life will be firmer.
From a more macroscopic point of view, the meaning of the Expo has gone beyond the economic and trade spheres. Instead, it focuses on the future, conveying the idea of openness, inclusiveness, welfare, balance, and mutual win, and forming a consensus to jointly address today’s challenges.
The world is good, China can be good; the world is good, China can be better.
We expect the Expo to bring the world a wonderful and fulfilling experience; we look forward to a higher level of "opening China" and a brighter future for the world to work together to build a common body of human destiny.
Foreign Media: The United States has reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The agreement included the opening of Canada's dairy market to the U.S. and the suspension of U.S. tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
The U.S. and Canada have reached a framework agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement, a Canadian news source said late on September 30, local time.
The agreement, it was revealed, included the opening of Canada's dairy market to the U.S. and the suspension of U.S. tariffs on cars produced in Canada.
The United States and Mexico announced a preliminary principled agreement on the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement on 27 August, but the United States and Canada were unable to reach an agreement before the August 31 deadline set by the United States to extend the negotiations until 30 September.
Earlier, a spokesman for Canada’s Foreign Minister, Frank Fleming, said Canada would only sign favourable agreements, “focusing on the substance rather than on the timetable. We will continue to consult in the hope of reaching agreements that are in Canada’s national interest.”
More than nine percent of Brazilian women say that the presidential candidate did not consider women's needs.
More than 90 per cent of Brazilian women do not think that the presidential candidate takes women's needs into account, according to data recently released by the Brazilian National Geographic Institute (IBGE), according to the South American diaspora news network.
It is reported that the number of women in Brazil has now reached 1.7 billion, and that if all Brazilian women were to be assembled into one country, the country would be ranked 13th in the world, more than twice the population of Spain.
In Brazil, women constitute 52 per cent of the total electorate and men 48 per cent, although women constitute a very high proportion of the electorate, but in Brazil's Congress, women constitute only 10 per cent.
Among 193 countries in the world, Brazil ranks 154th in terms of women's participation in politics, ahead of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years of struggle for rights, Brazilian women have still not succeeded in gaining the rights they deserve.
Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori points out that the phenomenon exists because of the co-operation of ancient patriarchal societies, racism, and capitalist values.
“Politics should have been a nation that advocated citizenship, identity, public goods, and consisted of multiple social groups, but Brazil’s politics belonged to a monopoly group and the majority of the population was not represented.”
A previous study by Locomotiva also found that 94 per cent of Brazilian women did not feel that elected politicians represented their rights, 90 per cent disagreed with politicians' decisions, and 93 per cent disagreed with current government policies.
“We need to reverse the problem of insufficient representation of women in parliament, and Brazil’s political system is still affected by inequality, with serious gender, class and racial discrimination still occurring in Brazil’s political field so far,” said Natalia Mori.
Despite the lack of women’s rights, most Brazilian women still believe in the power of democracy.
The survey showed that 76 per cent of women believed they could play a role in democratic elections and 72 per cent were interested in politics.
Moreover, 55 per cent of women believe that democratic politics is the best way to make women suffer less prejudice.

Zhang said the Chinese nation is now closer than ever to achieving the great goal of national renaissance and closer than ever to the center of the world stage.
“Our missions, responsibilities, and work are more glorious, challenging, and burdensome than ever before.”
Zhang Xiang emphasized that we should not forget the heart, remember the mission, push China-Hungary to build the Belt and Road Strategy and go far and deep, and draw a more beautiful construction of the Belt and Road Strategy, and devote all our strength to the development and construction of the motherland and the friendly cooperation of China-Hungary.
The T2 Terminal at Guilin Zhuang International Airport in Guangxi was officially opened on 30 June.
According to Zhao Lei Qin, secretary of the Communist Party of Guilin, the new terminal building will meet the demand of 12 million passengers per year, and will create a new advantage for air transport in Guilin. It is of great significance to further improve the modern three-way transport pattern of Guangxi River and sea linking, sea and rail linking, land linking, and airport linking.
Guilin is expected to receive more than 90 million visitors this year.
The expansion of the T2 terminal building of Guilin Zhuang International Airport and the station area is a major public utility project for the 60th anniversary celebrations of the establishment of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and a landmark project for the construction of Guilin International Tourist Destination.
The project was launched in December 2015 with a construction area of 10 million square meters and a total investment of RMB 32,58 billion.
On that day, more than 200 flights took off and landed at the T2 Terminal at Guilin Zhuang International Airport.
The design of the new station building is inspired by the mountain waters of Guilin. The view from the distance is like a "mountain waters of Guilin crown," the view is similar to the "long ridge ladders" landscape and the roof of the northern residence of Guilin overlapping with the mountain waters of Guilin.
According to the information, the new terminal building at Guilin Airport will meet the peak traffic of nearly 4,000 people entering and leaving Hong Kong every hour. Smart Airport technology such as intelligent baggage pick-up system, security integrated platform and facial recognition will be used to cover various business areas such as catering, wholesale goods, duty-free and leisure entertainment.
As growth in Europe, Asia, and emerging markets is mostly unencouraging, the US is increasingly the main engine of global economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container ship landed in the port of New Jersey, United States.
But the U.S. economy is also receiving close attention as current growth benefits from the time the fiscal stimulus gains from tax cuts.
“As the US recovers from full employment, a slump in the economy is inevitable.”
The only question, he says, is when it will happen, and in his opinion, it may only be ahead of schedule and not behind schedule.
Despite his optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy before the end of this year, the bank admits it will be more difficult to predict for much longer.
“In the absence of more sustainable investment growth to boost the potential for economic growth, the current growth driven by fiscal policy will be difficult to sustain,” the Buckley economist said in a study.
“At a time of lack of investment growth, the risk of a hard landing in 2020 will rise,” they said.
A series of enterprise surveys will show that the major economies are in the economic cycle phase at the end of the third quarter.
The eurozone and U.S. manufacturing surveys scheduled for next Monday will be of concern, followed by the services survey on Wednesday.
But the focus next week will inevitably be on U.S. non-agricultural employment data to be released next Friday, which will provide clues as to whether the tight job markets are pushing up wages sharply.
Its importance, not only because it is important for business profitability and consumer purchasing power, but also because of rising wages or triggering overall inflation, may cause US Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve/FED) officials to be anxious.
"Salaries will be of concern as they may rise again sharply in the same period as last month.
The September rise may not exceed 3% compared to the previous year, but we can fully expect it next month,” economists from the Dutch International Group (ING) wrote in a study.
At a time when holidays in China and other parts of Asia are causing the region to lose sight of data next week, European politics may be the source of market fluctuations.
In spite of the Italian government’s previous financial commitments to the EU, other EU member states will have to quickly determine whether they are resolutely opposed to Italy’s decision, which Trias does not support and wants to comply with EU rules.
With Brexit negotiations at a critical juncture, the British Conservative Party’s annual meeting in Birmingham is likely to spark fire.
Meanwhile, fears about emerging markets are unlikely to diminish as Brazil holds its expected presidential elections next weekend.
The vessel will be delivered to the Eastern Sea Branch of the National Oceanic Administration of China after its completion, said Chen Cheng, Director of the Oceanic Warning Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources, China. The launch of the vessel will be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
On 29 September, China's first 3,000-ton class large-scale floating vessel, the Yangxiang 22 Ship, was sunk by China's Wuhan Group.
The ship's construction will break the current bottlenecks in China's equipment for large-scale floating, submerged, recycled, and repair work.
"To Yang Rong 22" is mainly used for floating/submersible regular inspection maintenance, regular discharge and recovery, floating/submersible emergency discharge, recovery and repair, and has the ability to carry out comprehensive marine investigation tasks such as fracture surveys.
The new vessel was 89 metres long, 18 metres wide, and 7.2 metres deep, with a continual power of 10,000 nautical miles.
Wang Weiling, deputy general manager of武船集团, said: “To Yang Rong 22 is China’s first large-scale float-operating vessel and the only vessel in the country that has the capacity to carry up to ten meters of large-scale float-operation.
It is understood that the vessel will be delivered to the Eastern Sea Branch of the National Oceanic Administration of China after its completion, and Chen Cheng, Director of the Observation Department of the Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Natural Resources of China, said that the launch of the vessel would be of great significance for the development of China's offshore ocean observation system and the advancement of global ocean observation.
"The vessel is equipped with large-scale floating stock maintenance operations as well as comprehensive marine survey capability and is the first comprehensive vessel in China dedicated to floating stock operations and comprehensive marine surveys in the Middle and Far Sea.
With such a float-operating vessel, our ocean observations and ocean surveys will have a powerful advantage in the future.”
The first day of the 2018 International Extreme Sailing Series, scheduled to start on September 30, will be postponed until October 1, and a meeting will be held at the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center prior to the race, with the captains of 12 water-winged double-hulled sailboats from six countries and regions making their appearances.
In the aftermath of the storm's reverberation, strong winds continued in Hong Kong's pond, with maximum winds reaching as high as 24 knots, and the signal was delayed nearly 90 minutes from 1 p.m. at 30 p.m., while the winds remained unchanged, and the tournament's referee, Anne Middleland, announced the cancellation of the first day of the tournament and the delay until 1 p.m. on October 1.
“The strong winds blowing from the shore are continuing, and the sea conditions are too severe.”
“In this case, no one knows when the wind is blowing at the race boat,” Mr. Middleland explained.
Closer to the city’s stadium is the wisest option, given the current weather conditions, to cancel the game.”
There was still some disappointment for the crew who were all ready.
“The race boat is ready to stop and we are in good shape.”
“But I know that the rescheduling is the right choice, and I hope that today’s wind will be less and we’ll be able to show off,” said Qingdao’s steward, Max Richardson.
" Losing a day of time makes the game more interesting," said Olympic hopeful Europa Wilkinson of the New Zealand team for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
Because today's game will be increased, and there are only two days left to play.
Everybody must be working very hard.”
Although the winds were fierce, French ABM skipper Pierre Ives Durand spoke at a meeting before the race about his warm relations with Qingdao, the venue of the race: Five years ago, he was accidentally injured and broke his muscles, thanks to the treatment of the local medical team, and he was able to stand on the field today five years later.
The International Extreme Sailing Series was founded in 2007 as part of the World Sailing League, which is known for its competitions such as the World Volleyball Championship, the Americas Cup, and the World Sailing Tournament.
The Qingdao station competition will be based on Flying Phantom.
2018 was the eighth year of the series' launch at Qingdao, and Qingdao Station was also the opening battle for the series.
Despite continuing global financial market turmoil, the Hong Kong Financial Authority said Monday that foreign exchange funds' investment income in the third quarter of this year fell by 97 per cent year-on-year, but did better than in the previous quarter, as overseas stocks rose sharply and foreign exchange losses shrank sharply in the wake of the Sino-US trade war.
According to the Bank's latest data, foreign exchange funds recorded investment income of HK$1.6 billion in July-September 2018, significantly lower than the year-on-year figure of HK$61.8 billion, but better than the revised HK$100 million in the second quarter of this year.
At the Legislative Council meeting, Chairman Chen Delin said that the Hong Kong and emerging markets stock indices were backwards from the U.S. stock indices at the beginning of the Sino-US trade, and that market sentiment began to reverse after the U.S. stock indices reached their peak in late September and early October, as investors realized that the trade was also detrimental to the United States.
“Changing market sentiment is a good thing,” he said, “and it’s not much help to solve things if trade wars have only a one-sided effect.”
But he also pointed out that “if the Sino-US trade war is not resolved, financial-market volatility will continue to rise.”
In the third quarter of this year, foreign exchange funds lost overseas equity investment in Hong Kong by 8 per cent to HK$47 billion, while overseas equity investment earnings increased by 172 per cent to HK$128 billion, with foreign exchange losses of HK$162 billion and bond earnings of HK$97 billion falling by 24 per cent and 31 per cent respectively, largely reflecting a general rise in the dollar against major currencies during the quarter and a 3 per cent rise in the US interest rate in September.
Foreign exchange funds are mainly used to support Hong Kong dollar.
Hong Kong has had a linked exchange rate system with the dollar since 1983.
For Hong Kong's current financial situation, Mr Chen said, economic and asset market uncertainty has increased and downside risks have increased, but Hong Kong's financial system is stable and well-defended and has a strong earthquake-resistance capability.
“Hong Kong’s international investment position is well-balanced, with a net foreign asset value of $1.4 trillion, equivalent to four times GDP, more than 2.5 times Singapore’s and 0.6 times Japan’s, leaving ample room for downward cycles or reversals.”
Recently, Hong Kong bonds have continued to fall and expand with the dollar interest rate differential, Mr Chen said. The exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar had risen by more than 400 basis points on September 21, and the market generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise in Hong Kong bonds. Afterwards, the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar against the United States dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84.
But he believes that as the Hong Kong banks' interest rate hike cycle begins, and as Hong Kong's interest rate normalizes, future interest rates will be lower than those of the US dollar.
“Hong Kong’s interest rates will be more consistent with those of the US dollar, and people will need to be more careful about managing risks and preparing for market fluctuations.”
As Hong Kong's money was abundant, the three-month rate fell 0.9 per cent to 2.08179 per cent on Monday, expanding from 46 base points to 51; the one-month rate was a new five-month low, expanding from 120 base points to 127.
Between May and September, the current exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar was closer to $7.85 to $1 for most of the time.
During the period, due to factors such as the withdrawal of funds from equity offerings and the completion of large-scale equity offerings, the weak party's convertible guarantees were triggered several times in May and August, following the first trigger in April.
To maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate, the gold management board purchases and sells dollars at the 7.85 level under the linked exchange rate system.
A total of HK$ 521.2 billion was purchased by the Bank in May and August under the weak party exchange guarantee mechanism.
Are there any advantages for foreigners under the new tax law?
To maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new Personal Income Tax Act will be to consider making preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong and Macau, including those from Hong Kong and Macau.
A reporter asked that the newly revised Personal Income Tax Act adjusted the criterion for assessing personal income taxable residents in China from one year to 183 days.
Will there be any preferential arrangements for overseas persons, including those from Hong Kong and Macau, when the law is implemented?
The head of the department responded that the current Ordinance implementing the Personal Income Tax Act has special preferential provisions for the taxation of persons outside China. Individuals who have no residence in China but have lived there for more than five years and whose income comes from outside China may pay personal income tax only on the part paid by units or individuals in China.
In order to maintain policy stability, the next step in implementing the new Personal Income Tax Act will be to consider making preferential arrangements for persons outside Hong Kong and Macau, including those from Hong Kong and Macau.
There are no thresholds for the Moon Center: quality certification promotes quality improvement.
With the rise of the two-child economy and the boom in the market for mothers and babies, monthly meetings of various kinds have sprung up all over the country, spreading from the north to the three- or four-way cities.
The current hot moon will satisfy the consumption needs of the masses, charges ranging from tens of thousands of dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, but at the same time is embarrassing, the agency so far has no thresholds, regulation still exists a vacuum.
The State Administration for Market Regulation recently launched the 2018 nationwide "Quality Month" series of activities, reporters visited a five-star Lunar Center in Tianjin City to visit the mother and baby care service certification experience.
General maternity centers provide services such as nursing, nutritional meals, postpartum restoration plastics etc.
At the Lunar Center, reporters saw nurses check infants' breastfeeding every day and specialist nurses provide delicate nursing services such as bathing, touching and so on.
At the same time, in order to meet the needs of new mothers, from early wound care in the uterus, to beauty care in the middle and late uterus, provide Chinese medicine treatment beauty and other nursing programs to help mothers to restore their beautiful appearance.
A new mother living there told reporters that she had been planning for the monthly party eight months earlier.
Menstrual services directly affect the comfort and physical recovery of the pregnant woman during her period. Some small-scale menstrual services are limited to simple services, there are unregulated disinfection and hygiene, and there are risks of cross-infection, and the diet alone is not scientific.
The head of the Lunar Center said they are the only one in Tianjin City that has a B-level service certification.
“While some customers initially did not understand the meaning of the B-level certification, it is important for the long-term development of the enterprise to benefit from the process management through certification that forces firms to be strictly standardized,” he said.
"Accreditation of services is a new type of certification system based on customer perception and focus on organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics. It is an important part of the quality infrastructure of the country and has a positive role in increasing the ratio of quality service delivery and enhancing China's international competitiveness in services," said Mr. Pan Lifeng, Deputy Director of the Certification and Supervision Division of the State General Administration for Market Regulation.
Starting in 2004, after more than 10 years of development, the service certification project has undergone from non-existent, gradual development process, emerged such as financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, product after-sales service certification, e-commerce service certification, health service certification, etc.
According to the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification agencies in China, more than 2,000 service certification personnel, and nearly 8,000 valid certification certificates.
Pan Lifeng said that the development of service certification should be further guided and promoted, with the gradual expansion of the coverage of service certification in health, education, sports, finance and consumer goods sectors, thus contributing to the reform of the service supply side and the improvement of quality.
LONDON, Nov 5 (LETA) - Hong Kong's housing prices have been falling for two consecutive months since they hit their peak, Hong Kong Financial Authority (FMA) President Chen Delin said Monday.
Mr Chen also said that if the price hike were reversed, the first people to be affected would be those employed at the peak of the housing market, but it is expected that there would be a sharp fall in property prices, such as in the Asian financial storm of 1997, and that there would be much less opportunity for the public to cut property prices substantially.
At the Legislative Council briefing, Mr Chen Delin, chairman of several senior management boards, said that measures could be relaxed in due course if the housing markets were confirmed to be in a downward cycle.
“But now that we’ve seen just a few weeks of data, relax, it’s still too early to see whether the housing market is going into the downward cycle.”
Since October 2009, the Bank has implemented eight rounds of reverse-cyclical measures to tighten mortgages for various types of properties, including reducing the number of mortgages, requiring mortgage applicants to undergo rigorous stress tests and so on, to improve bank risk management and earthquake-resistant capacity.
With Hong Kong officially entering the interest rate hike cycle, the whole of Hong Kong's private housing index plummeted for two consecutive months in August-September, and the month-on-month decline expanded to 1.4% in September.
But the cumulative increase for the first three quarters of this year remained 10.2%.
In the second quarter, the proportion of homeless households in Hong Kong was 66 per cent higher than the average of 60 per cent in 2009-11; the average number of newly issued mortgages and the ratio of newly issued mortgages to payments and income was 47 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, with a significant improvement from 64 per cent and 41 per cent respectively in 2009-11, according to the Bank's data.
However, Mr Chen said the high seismic resistance does not mean that already-located residents will not be harmed by the economic downturn, as property valuations will fall and those who buy buildings in peak periods will be the first to take the risk.
While the Bank has tightened its lending to mortgage lenders, homeowners can also obtain high rates of mortgage loans through mortgage insurance or through the provision of mortgage loans by developers.
According to Mr Chen, 85-90 per cent of borrowers now have mortgages, along with mortgage loans provided to developers, and negative assets (i.e., the value of property has fallen below the level of the total unpaid mortgage loans) would occur if the price of the building fell by a hundred per cent.
However, Mr Nguyen, vice-president of the Banking Authority, noted that the authorities estimated a high percentage of the total amount of loans provided by developers, accounting for only 2-2.5 per cent of the total amount of bank loans, and that the proportion was still low.
At its peak in 2003, Hong Kong had more than 100,000 cases of negative assets, accounting for 22% of its housing providers.
As of the third quarter of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative assets for seven consecutive quarters.
Beijing, Oct 1 (China News Agency) - E-commerce retail and export enterprises are experiencing another wave of negative tax benefits on October 1, involving value added tax, consumer tax exemption and so on.
The Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Commerce and the General Administration of Customs have jointly issued a clear statement to test the VAT and excise duty exemption policy for goods exported by exporting enterprises in the cross-border e-commerce integrated test zone that have not obtained valid import certificates, while complying with the following conditions.
First, e-commerce export enterprises are registered in the review area, and the integrated service platform on the cross-border e-commerce line registers the date, name, unit of measurement, quantity, single price and amount of exports.
Secondly, the export goods are to be declared by the Customs of the place where the review district is located.
Thirdly, export goods do not belong to the Ministry of Finance and the General Administration of Taxation under the State Council's decision to explicitly cancel export refund (exempt) duties.
Notify clearly that the General Administration of Customs regularly transmits electronic information to the State Administration of Taxation on the list of electronic commerce export goods declaration.
The tax authorities of the review districts shall strengthen the tax-free management of export goods by means of electronic information on the list of export goods declared pursuant to the clearance of the State Administration of Taxation.
It is noted that the specific administrative measures for tax exemption are formulated by the provincial tax department, the commercial finance department and the commercial department.
The offices of the lead committee for the construction of review districts and the competent departments of commerce should coordinate to promote communication and coordination between departments and implement relevant policies, speed up the establishment of the export statistical monitoring system of e-commerce, and promote the rapid development of cross-border e-commerce health.
A man in Liaoning Province murdered his lover and threw him to the ground, then fled to Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, due to disagreements over the distribution of money and property.
On 5 May, the police department of the East Zheng District of Ordos City, Inner Mongolia, reported that the man was successfully arrested after a joint investigation by the two police stations.
On 26 June 2018, a woman disappeared in Anshan City, Liaoning Province, and her family reported to local police.
According to the police investigation, this is not a simple case of population disappearance, the missing person white is very likely to be killed by Valentine Wang, the police immediately set up a special investigation team to further investigate.
On October 30, the Special Task Force discovered that the suspect Wang may be hiding in the Dongxiang District of Ordos, and the Dongxiang Police immediately organized a full-fledged police force to cooperate with Liaoning Police to investigate the case.
After five days of investigation, the civilian police finally figured out the point of the king's footsteps, and made a detailed composite of his relatives.
On 4 November, two local police units arrested suspect Wang at a digging machine accessories store in Dongxing District.
According to Wang, he had a love affair with the victim, White, because White's sister had a large amount of money that was temporarily held by White, and the two decided to take the money for themselves.
On June 22, 2018, King and White broke up a disagreement over controlling the funds, killing White in a rented apartment, and decomposing the body.
At present, the suspect Wang has been transferred to Liaoning Anshan Police.
The Green Development in Action theme train of the Five Great Developments of Good Anhui has been launched
The second theme train of the "Five Great Developments and Good Anhui"—the theme train of "Green Development in Action"—was officially launched on May 5.
In order to showcase the magnificent achievements of the construction work of the "Five Great Developments and Good Anhui", the Hefei City Railway Company and the Golden Cuckoo Media Technology Company jointly designed and produced the "Five Great Developments and Good Anhui" series of thematic trains.
The first train, the “Innovation in Action” theme train, was officially launched on October 1 on Line 1 of Hefei railway.
This time the theme train chose the main tone of blue and green symbolizing mountain water, reflecting the birth machine, vitality and pure feeling.
The contents of the publicity showcase the core idea of the "Five Great Developments for Good Anhui" as well as 18 representative examples of green development results in the province, including the Jianghuai Canal Project, the Forest Management Project, the Yangtze River Economic Zone Protection Project, and the 10 million acres of forest growth project.
In addition, three thematic trains – “Coordinate Development in Action”, “Open Development in Action”, and “Share Development in Action” – will be launched in the near future.
On the first day of the Mainland National Day "Golden Week" and the last day of the public holiday of the National Day of Hong Kong, many residents of the Mainland used the holiday to travel abroad for leisure and shopping, and many of Hong Kong's inhabitants returned to Hong Kong on the same day.
According to the data provided by the Shenzhen Border Control Headquarters, as of 16 pm, the number of people entering and leaving Shenzhen ports reached 42.9 million people, and the number of transportation vehicles reached 16.8 million (ships, shelves, columns) times.
It is understood that the number of tourists who travel to Europe and Southeast Asia for holiday shopping on National Day holidays is continuing to increase due to many advantages such as the increased number of countries that provide the Chinese citizens with a visa-free travel policy.
Early on the 1st of the day, the arrival and departure directions of ports such as Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Hong Kong, and Fuda will see the peak of passenger traffic, including the peak of passenger traffic at Luohu from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and the peak of passenger traffic at Shenzhen Bay from 6:30 a.m. to 13:00 p.m.
According to the information, in order to cope with the peak flow of passengers and vehicles, the Shenzhen border checkpoint will be deployed in accordance with the uniform deployment of the National Immigration Authority to initiate the mode of work during the peak flow of passengers and vehicles, arrange overtime security to support the line of work, open the check-in corridors in advance, guide passengers and vehicles to orderly check-in, ensure that Chinese citizens are not queued for up to 30 minutes at the entrance and exit checkpoints, while taking into account the efficiency of foreigners' check-in, strengthen the maintenance of order in densely populated areas, and ensure the security and order of the check-in.
At the same time, the Shenzhen Border Control Station reminds the passengers to pay attention to the validity period of their documents, visas and signatures before travelling, to make reasonable arrangements for travel, to avoid the peak time of traffic, and to choose the appropriate time and port to travel.
Passengers travelling to Hong Kong on the Guangdong-Hong Kong High-Speed Railway shall be required to have a valid Immigration Certificate and a Visa Signature. High-speed Railway tickets are valid only as a Passenger Certificate and cannot be used as an Immigration Certificate. If they are unable to leave Hong Kong for reasons such as lack of documentation, they should follow the directions of the Border Patrol Police and wait for the Hong Kong Railway Company staff to bring them to the designated location to complete the journey back to the Mainland.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic suspicious disease that involves multiple organs, and was previously considered “untreated.”
The mechanism of its occurrence is unknown, it is difficult to diagnose and treat, and there are no effective treatment methods.
Recently, a joint team of researchers at Tsinghua University School of Life Sciences, Liu Wanli, and the director of the Humidity Immune Center at Beijing University People's Hospital, Cheng Qing, discovered that human immune globulins exhibit molecular mutations that increase the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus, and these mutations are involved in regulating immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in humans is an important cause of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to one of the authors, Sun Xiaolin of Kitadai People's Hospital, the team collected nearly 2000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and conducted research. It was found that the incidence and severity of inflammatory diseases such as kidney inflammation, arthritis, pulmonary inflammation, vascular inflammation and other diseases were significantly increased in patients with immunoglobulin deficiency.
Through a variety of research methods, including immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli and his team discovered that this immune molecule activates the pathway of immune signals and promotes the pathogenic mechanism of B cells secreting various antibodies of their own.
The journalists learnt that the two teams are strongly combined to fully realize their respective advantages and realize the close combination of basic research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli's team is dedicated to the immune identification and immune activation of B lymphocytes, while Kuri's team has long been engaged in the clinical study of systemic lupus erythematosus.
“This is one of the results of years of collaboration between the two teams, and the first time the academic community has recognized that immunoglobulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, laying a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted treatment.”
It's not about short-term protection, it's about doing things according to law.
Lawyers carrying axes to court proceedings?
The news was really exciting at first, and it also set the boilerplate for the legal circle.
A fine of $500 was subsequently imposed on the lawyers involved and a written recommendation was made to the Quanzhou Bar Association to investigate and deal with the case.
According to the New York Times, the two lawyers were not involved in violations of the law and were not punished according to the law.
According to many reports, the treatment of the Quanzhou Covenant was not short-sighted or confrontational, but received the approval of the Quanzhou Central Court.
An incident that might have caused tensions within the legal community was eventually resolved.
The reversal of the situation stems from a more complete truth: the axe carried by the defendant's lawyers is the same type and type of weapon as the defendant's, but without a blade, and serves only as auxiliary evidence at the testimony stage, and has no intention of intimidating or "threatening the security of the court".
There are four very important details that need to be taken into account in deciding whether the conduct of the lawyer involved is illegal or unlawful: First, the local court held two previous hearings, showing only a photograph of the axe, and from the defence point of view showing that the original axe was necessary; Second, the axe was purchased one hour before the hearing, and the lawyer was not willing to seek the judge's consent, but was objectively unable to contact the judge; Third, the entire axe was not abused or improperly used; Fourth, the lawyer involved publicly admitted his mistakes at the earliest opportunity and expressed his apologies to the court.
Combined with these events, it can be seen that the lawyers involved did not have anything to do with bringing an axe to court, but only to defend themselves.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Covenant did not push the boat, but overcome the pressure and made the decision not to punish.
This decision has also been tested by facts and by law.
It is indeed easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding as to the fact that the ax used as a control knife is brought to court without the court's permission.
For reasons of safety and caution, the Quanzhou Central Court's previous fines and judicial recommendations are also inadequate.
In order to preserve the dignity of lawyers and prevent individual courts from blaming lawyers, the Supreme Court issued the Judicial Police Security Inspection Rules of the People’s Court in 2014, establishing the principle that lawyers are not required to carry out personal security inspections in court.
Since the rule's promulgation, a large number of lawyers have acted as a rule and few cases have occurred where security breaches have jeopardized the security of the courts.
In exceptional cases such as those in Quanzhou, misunderstandings can easily be eliminated by communicating in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.
As an autonomous organization of the legal profession, the Bar Association has a dual mission of punishing wrongdoing and ensuring legality.
In the past, individual law-enforcement organizations have been criticized for focusing on punishment rather than guarantees.
And the decision of Quanzhou Co-operative, whether from the process or the result, is commendable, sets an example for more Co-operative properly.
As of October 1, what tax benefits will affect our purses?
Xinhua, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The new Personal Income Tax Act will come into force on January 1, 2019.In order for the general public to benefit from tax reduction benefits at the earliest possible date, the taxpayer's actual earnings will be deducted at the starting point of 5,000 yuan per month from October 1, and the new tax rate table will apply.
What are the benefits that the new government will bring to the pockets of the masses?
Benefit One: The tax reduction on wages and salaries is noticeable
Taxpayers who receive salaries after October 1 can deduct the basic reduction of 5,000 yuan/month and apply the new tax rate table. Most taxpayers have different levels of tax reduction, especially for middle and low-income taxpayers.
According to the tax reduction tables for different income groups, those with monthly incomes of 8,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan deducted from the "Three Risks One Month" were taxed at 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 159 yuan, and 9090 yuan, respectively, after the tax change, and the corresponding rate of tax reduction was 73.9 per cent, 61.1 per cent, 49.0 per cent, and 18.8 per cent, respectively, compared to the monthly starting point of 3,500 yuan.
It should be noted that, due to holidays, the wages paid by the units at the end of September in accordance with the law, which should have been paid in October, may be applied to the new basic deductions and tax rates table.
For this purpose, the deduction client software used by the tax department for unified promotion has provided the corresponding tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still has to be declared and paid within the statutory declaration period.
Benefit Two: Low tax rate range significantly increased
In addition to raising the collection point, the new rate table will apply from 1 October.
The seven-degree tax rate on wages and salaries remains the same as before, but the tax rate range has changed significantly, with the 3%, 10%, and 20% three-degree low rate ranges significantly expanding, the 25% tax rate range shrinking, and the 30%, 35%, and 45% three-degree high rate ranges remaining unchanged.
It is worth noting that the tax law also adjusted the tax rates for each type of production and operation, of which the maximum rate of 35% was raised from 10 million yuan to 50 million yuan.
This means that individuals, businesses, and private equity partnerships will all benefit from the tax changes.
“From the preliminary calculations of the personal tax cuts for taxpayers in Shanghai, taxpayers will fully feel the benefits of a tax reform, especially the significant tax cuts for middle- and low-income groups.”
Lan Min, head of the Personal Income Tax Office of the Shanghai State Administration of Taxation, said.
Benefit 3: Tax service is more convenient and optimized
Since the promulgation of the new Personal Income Tax Act, the Shanghai Tax Department has undertaken a series of comprehensive and extensive tax campaigns.
On the one hand, policy counseling for key tax sources and key enterprises is conducted "one-to-one, one-to-one".
The newly-established State Revenue Department visited large enterprises such as Apple Trade (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Payment宝 (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Red Star Mei Kailong Home Group Co., Ltd., which had a large number of employees, large amounts of deductions and payments, large amounts of taxes, and the tax department actively advised and responded to suspicion; the State Revenue Department visited the large labor enterprises in the area, such as China Intellectual Financial Advisory Co., Ltd. and China Intellectual Shanghai Economic Technology Cooperative Co., Ltd., and collected the concerns of the enterprises in time, responded to their complaints, and resolved their difficulties.
On the other hand, to the general public taxpayers, to carry out "all-round, multi-dimensional, three-dimensional" tax policy.

The annual Yangcheng Lake crab culture tourism festival kicks off on the 30th day, according to Ba Town Party Party secretary Tan Wenhua of Yangcheng Lake crab's town, the town's annual economic output is nearly 3.8 billion yuan and net income exceeds 6.8 billion yuan.
The crab is also known as the golden crab of Lake Yangcheng, because it does not have clay on its body, and is known as the "King of the Crab" because it has a white shell and a thick, creamy flesh.
The golden autumn crab diet has become a conventional practice.
Big Crab is the most well-known image representative of the city of Ba.
Cut the crab shells, suck the crab legs, pick the crab meat, dip the crabs, the eater feels the beauty of being in Jiangnan.
This year, more customers will spend more time in Ba City, enjoy the fun of catching crabs and enjoy the slow-paced countryside life by watching eagles and enjoying the sunset west of Lake Yangcheon, says Jin Wei, a crab farmer.
Due to the widespread introduction of large-scale seedlings in Ba Town, this year the heads of large crabs out of water are much larger than in the past.
Nearly 20 years ago, Chinese crab farmer Chen Zhenhua was planning to export crab seeds and breeding technology from Lake Yangcheng to Thailand, allowing the country's cuisine to cross borders and fostering cultural exchanges with overseas cuisine.
The town of Qunqing is a cultural landmark of the city.
At present, Ba City has built crab gardens, fishermen lanterns, spring and autumn water city, Liu crab city, Zheng Yi Bai crab market five crab market and a street of food, around Yangcheng Lake big crabs do catering business of large and small restaurants up to 1,300 houses, scaled crabs of different colors are eye-catching, and at the peak of the passenger flow, the car water trolley becomes a unique scenic line.
A crab attracts nearly three million tourists in and out of the sea every year, and it also forms the vibrant, two-sided, two-way street of the city.
A number of tourist products such as the Kunku theme post office at Baxi Railway Station, a collection of drawing concept books, an image museum of a pink ink baby theme, a Kunku theme guest house, an embroidery shop, a flag-clothes shop, etc. were introduced, and a number of famous studios such as Kunku scholar Yang Mori松, the master of flute, Chen Dongbo, the famous Kunku Xiao Zhou Yuu Lin, the master of bamboo engraving crafts, Ni Xiao Zhou, the inheritor of folk songs Lu Zhenryo, etc. settled in the old street became the cultural core of the "Kinku town" of Baxi.

The signing of a tripartite trade agreement in Mexico will bring new opportunities for 500 million people.
The United States, Canada, and Mexico have reached a trilateral trade agreement, to be known as the USMCA, according to a joint statement by Canadian Foreign Minister Franklin D.C. and U.S. Trade Representative Leith Hesse, published on the Canadian government’s website.
Previously, Canadian TV News quoted senior U.S. officials as saying that Canada and the United States had resolved their differences and reached an agreement on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources who were familiar with the situation as saying that the agreement reached between the United States and Canada on September 30 would retain the North American FTA as a trilateral trade agreement and that the three leaders would sign a new agreement within two months.
“Today, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have agreed on a new trade agreement, the USMCA, which will provide high-standard trade agreements for our workers, farmers, and companies, which will lead to more free markets, more fair trade, and more sustainable economic growth, which will strengthen the middle class, create high-paying jobs, and create new opportunities for some 500 million people,” the statement said.
It is reported that the current North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994 by the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Trump announced after taking office that he planned to reconsider the agreement and sign a new one.
The three countries launched the negotiation process in 2017.
An early Okinawa Governor's election was held on the morning of Monday morning, after the death of former governor Yuan Chang-oshi, and the election result was announced.
The vote was counted on September 30, and the final result showed that Tama City received 39.62 million votes, the highest in the history of the Okinawa County Governor's election, with more than 80,000 more than its main contender, Jun Saki.
A total of four candidates participated in the election, with a voter turnout of 63.24%, down 0.89 percentage points from the 2014 Okinawa County Governor's election.
The results of the election showed that the county people did not want to waste Mr. O'Neill's efforts before he died, and that he would inherit his will and continue to work with the Japanese and U.S. governments to oppose plans to relocate U.S. bases and shut down U.S.-based bases, Tama City told the media on Monday.
The U.S.-Japanese government had previously agreed to move the U.S.-Japanese military base to the old-growth area of Banno Bay, Okinawa County, but the Okinawan people strongly opposed it, hoping to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
As for the relocation plan, which was strongly opposed by county residents, and the demand for the withdrawal of permits for the reclaiming of land along the ancient coast, Tama City said he had not initially taken a position of opposition and division with the central government, and hoped that the two sides would exchange views fully and show their willingness to settle through consultation.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also told the media on the morning that he would take the result seriously and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa and alleviate the base’s burden.
The government's approach to moving U.S. bases as soon as possible remains unchanged, Japan's Chief of the Housing Department, Yoshio Suga, said at a press conference on Monday.
At the same time, he also expressed his hopes for talks with玉城.
Tama City will be officially appointed governor of Okinawa County on 4th of this month.
Since the mid-2000s, as China's demand for oilseeds has grown, American farmer Paul Thomas in North Dakota has grown more soybeans on his land.
This shift reached its peak this year, when he planted 1,600 acres of soybeans on 5,000 acres of land at an unprecedented scale.
But Thomas and many farmers like him plan to plant corn and wheat as the staple crops in the pre-2019 U.S. agricultural zone.
American farmers have grown more soybeans than corn this year, for the first time in 35 years.
The reason for the replanting of other food crops is that American farmers are facing difficulties selling soybeans in the context of US President Donald Trump’s trade war against China.
China usually buys about 60 per cent of American exports of soybeans, but the trade war has led to nearly zero purchases of American soybeans in recent months, pushing soybean prices down to a decade low.
Thomas plans to grow more wheat next year, hoping to make more money by reducing his dependence on crops that depend on China.
Thomas says soybean prices “bring us a painful blow.”
Without China's demand, he said, soybeans are available at $7.10 per potato ear near his farm and $8.50 for cover costs.
American farmers have recorded soybean cultivation this year, and the yield is expected to be record high.
They faced a trade war at a time when it was easy to be hit.
In response to Trump’s tariff increases on Chinese goods, China imposed tariffs on American soybeans in July.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will issue its first forecast for next year's crop area, expected to include considerations of tariff implications.
It is expected that the estimate will confirm the expected reduction in the area planted with soybeans by civil society.
According to a Reuters report, Informa Economics predicted on October 19 that corn cultivation would increase by 4% to 9.27 million acres (3.7 million hectares) in 2019, and soybean cultivation would decrease by 7% to 8.3 million acres.
Informa also predicts a 4% increase in American wheat cultivation.
The area of soybeans planted before the imposition of retaliation tariffs rose to 89.6 million acres this year, up from about 15.5 million acres 10 years ago.
Corn has grown from less than five million acres in 2008 to 8,910 million acres this year, while wheat has grown to 4,780 million acres, the lowest level in nearly 100 years.
Aron Carlson, president of the Illinois Corn Cultivation Association, owns a total area of 3,600 acres, and this year he plans to use nearly half of it to grow soybeans, but plans cuts in the future.
He said his farm in northern Illinois could increase corn cultivation by up to 20%, the largest soybean-growing state in the United States.
Soybeans yield less than corn per acre, but require less fertilizer, making soybeans generally less expensive to grow.
If farmers switch to end-of-life corn, the cost may rise, but it will benefit some businesses, including Anderson Inc fertilizer distributors.
Peter Bowe, executive director of Andersons, told Reuters that he expects corn transplantation to be beneficial for fertilizer use.
Bayer is also expected to benefit from corn transfers by farmers.
Thailand's director for airport management, Mr Sutilawa, apologized for the shooting of a Chinese citizen at the airport and said Thailand welcomed Chinese tourists and that the authorities would step up management and raise service awareness to avoid similar incidents.
On 27 July, the airport security officials reportedly clashed with a Chinese man refused entry.
The airport authorities have suspended him and established an investigative committee to investigate the matter in accordance with the procedure, which will resign the security if the facts are true, Mr. Sutilawa said.
Currently, the Thai Immigration Bureau has arranged for the man to return to China by plane.
She expressed regret at the incident, which damaged Thailand's image, and said Thailand attached great importance to the incident and would do its utmost to reduce the impact of the incident on tourists and would send an apology letter to the parties through the Chinese Embassy in Thailand.
He said the airport is willing to facilitate Chinese tourists to Thailand, and the Immigration Bureau of Thailand has set up special immigration channels for Chinese tourists at five major international airports in Bangkok, including Suvarnabhumi, Korman, Chiang Mai, Phugyu and Ai.
The next step, he said, would be for the Airport Authority to reform the ground-signing area, clarify the cost of ground-signing, and improve the quality of service and communication capabilities of staff.
When the Chinese Embassy in Thailand learns of this, contacts the parties first and understands what has happened.
At the same time, the Thai Immigration Bureau, the Airport Authority, and the Department of Tourism and Sports have been consulted, requesting Thailand to investigate the incident and to punish the perpetrators severely, and will continue to maintain close communications with Thailand to deal with the matter properly and to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties concerned.
New China International Times: Defending multilateralism, China knows how to unite.
International rules and multilateral order are being undermined in the current moment of a reversal of unilateralism.
To some extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism is entering a critical period.
As a responsible major power, China, with the principles of embracing power, embracing common roads and taking firm and vigorous action, will work together with the international community to maintain and promote multilateralism.
Faced with new challenges in the new situation, China has made a loud voice about the direction and path of multilateralism.
As Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in his speech at the 73rd General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly, a new era of multilateralism should be guided by the goal of cooperation and win-win, rule-based order, equity and justice, and effective action.
At the same time, China calls for the establishment of a global development cooperation pattern with the United Nations as the core, with North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-South cooperation as complementary, and calls on all parties to work together to build a community of human destiny.
China's thinking and voice reflects the mainstream voice of the international community.
As the 73rd President of the United Nations, José Ignacio Espinoza, put it, in the current situation, “the United Nations needs more than ever to promote multilateralism and maintain a rule-based international system.”
The international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, adhere to international trade rules and resolve differences through consultations, said IMF President Richard Lagarde.
In recent years, with the adjustment of global economic and political forces, a number of emerging markets and groups of developing countries have emerged, playing a greater role in the major international multilateral mechanisms, providing new impetus for the development of the multilateralism that has been hit by the winds.
Taking this dimension into account, the multilateralism philosophy advocated by China, such as building large families rather than patching together small circles, insisting on co-operative construction rather than making the winners eat and drink, in line with the current trends, is the inevitable choice to address global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common appeal of most countries in the world.
Have advanced ideas and more solid action.
China's Belt and Road Initiative has become the largest international cooperation platform.
China’s international and regional cooperation initiatives, such as building the Belt and Road Corridor, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the 16+1 Cooperation, promote regional international cooperation, perfect the existing international system and order, bring innovative dynamism to multilateral cooperation, and contribute to the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction.
As a guardian of international order and a practitioner of multilateralism, China's actions are increasingly powerful on this multilateral stage of the United Nations.
Good offices in international hotspots, tackling climate change, participating in peacekeeping operations, heavily reducing poverty and helping other countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
China has become an important pillar of multilateralism, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Guterres, has said.
As the world’s “confidence deficit” grows, as populist and polarization trends rise, it is precisely when the world’s need for multilateral cooperation is most pressing.
At this historic juncture, the international community needs to step up its efforts to translate consensus into action, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of a community of human destiny.

The report reads as follows: 30 September is the fifth anniversary of the country's martyrdom.
At 10 a.m. on the same day, Xi Jinping and other party leaders attended a ceremony to pay flower baskets to the heroes of the people and commemorate the heroes.
This is our country's first martyrs' commemoration day after the implementation of the heroic martyrs protection law.
Five years ago, when the Memorial Day was established on the eve of the National Day, to demonstrate the great journey of the Chinese nation from suffering to glory, we should always wake up: “Where do we come from, and where do we go?”
The Chinese head of state has emphatically pointed out that “abandoning traditions and losing them is tantamount to breaking one’s own spiritual veins.”
“Never forget history to open the future.”
Our worship of heroes and martyrs is always to remember history, to continue the spirit of heroism and to consolidate the strong positive energy of national revival.
The quick review points out that bravery is the backbone of the nation.
Honoring the martyrs, the martyrs of sacrifice, is to make the martyrs of our hearts a noble, holy, powerful and eternal memory.
According to incomplete statistics, about 20 million martyrs sacrificed their lives for national independence, people's liberation and the country's prosperity and people's happiness.
Every pioneer who donated his body to the country will be remembered, and every spirit of devotion to the country will be admired.
The establishment of National Remembrance Day for them and the organization of various forms of commemorative activities are intended to pay tribute to them in the name of the country, to deeply remember their great achievements and to learn to inherit their precious spirit of love for the motherland, loyalty to the people, selfless dedication and daring to sacrifice.
The governments of the Party committees at various levels have perfected the system of preferential pensions and improved the level of pension treatment, and the Party and Party have practiced the veneration of heroes through practical action.
Every year, countless people look back at the mausoleum, let us experience the deep feelings of the people's remembrance, feel the revival momentum rising in the bloodstream of the nation.
Honoring heroes, defending heroes, studying heroes, caring for heroes has become popular throughout society.
In conclusion, in today's new era of Chinese socialism, we can comfort the heroes who have been sleeping underground: a strong China is rising in the East, and the dream of the great revival of the Chinese nation is being realized in our hands.
Let us push forward with brave spirit and strive for great goals!

The Fifth "Disability Speech Month" Comes to Focus on Sexual Education Issues of Disabled Teens - ChinaNet
In recent years, the topic of sexual education of teenagers in China has been discussed extensively, but the challenge for sexual education of disabled teenagers is still very difficult.
Recently, a symposium on the challenges and practical strategies of comprehensive education for people with disabilities was held in Beijing.
How to provide sexual education to disabled children and young people is an important topic of this seminar.
The report on gender-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours among children with disabilities and youth in China, published at the conference, showed that the proportion of children with disabilities who suffer sexual harassment and sexual abuse is higher than those who are healthy.
For children with disabilities and adolescents, more attention is given in society to "sexual protection".
The seminar is aimed at promoting comprehensive education for children and young people with disabilities in China in three areas: family support, school education and institutional services. It is intended to provide support to children and young people with disabilities from the outset and to enable them to enjoy the right to love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public's understanding of people with disabilities has remained on an insufficiently profound level.
The comprehensive education of people with disabilities, especially children and young people with disabilities, in China is not sufficiently comprehensive due to factors such as traditional ideas.
But in recent years, with the support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and public-interest organizations, sexual and reproductive health education practices and paths for the full cycle development of disabled people in China have developed satisfactorily.
The report shows that children and young people with visual, auditory, intellectual and physical disabilities, although more difficult than ordinary people to acquire sexual knowledge and to understand intimacy, have generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
The Symposium on Strategies for the Challenge and Practice of Comprehensive Education for Persons with Disabilities, organized by the Shanghai People's Trust Foundation, is co-sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Federation for the Assistance of Persons with Disabilities (French) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and aims to explore the practices and pathways of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for persons with disabilities in the context of the Great Strategy for Health in China, and to promote the understanding of international policies on comprehensive education and the health rights of children and young people with disabilities by stakeholders such as policy makers, educators, researchers, social services organizations, and parents.
BEIJING, Sept 30 (LETA) - The Central Bank of China (CBC) announced on Sunday short-term net foreign-exchange asset forecasts showing that as of the end of August, foreign-currency reserves for long-term and futures contracts in the country were zero for 12 months in a row, compared to less than one in a month.
As of the end of August last year, the central bank held a total of $60.44 billion in foreign currencies for long-term and futures contracts, which remained unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, with a total of $42.76 billion in SDRs, according to the central bank's preliminary data.
Since then, the central bank’s foreign-exchange long-term headline has been zero.
The central bank first released the data at the end of March 2016, with figures showing that foreign currency transactions with the central bank at the end of February 2016 amounted to $24.38 billion in long-term and futures contracts and $29.8 billion in short-term contracts.
The September figures, released at the end of October of the same year, showed for the first time a net increase of $164.01 billion to $453.01 billion.
Earlier, the central bank had said that the foreign currency's long-term and futures headline mainly reflected the central bank's long-term foreign exchange operations with commercial banks to meet the demand for foreign-currency liabilities bonds and would continue to provide long-term hedge products on the principle of real demand, and that the central bank's long-term operations had little impact on future foreign exchange reserves.
On the evening of September 20, this year, on the K158 train, Zhengzhou high school student Joe took a ride to Cranewall.
A gentleman on the train bought a ticket without a seat, but took her seat: “Take it, take it.”
After two hours, the conductor advised him that an hour was still ineffective.
Eventually, a man in the same carriage couldn't see down to pull him up.
From the public’s point of view, although the ultimate outcomes were mostly public condemnation, administrative punishment by the public security department, and even inclusion on the blacklist of integrity, the public still did not “resent”: Why not punish the hegemon on the spot?
Why not stop their immoral or even illegal acts on the spot and punish them afterwards?
And for the irrational behavior of the "Head Lord," how could it be that only a male passenger "walked unfairly" and dragged him away?
The main reason for this is that only long-distance trains are equipped with guards, and short-distance trains generally do not; even with guards, guards are more concerned about the possible unreliable reaction of the hegemony and do not take compulsory evacuation measures.
The repeated occurrences of hexagonal events have made people realize that it is necessary for the hexagon to be forced off the scene and even punished in order to act as a deterrent.
This demands that our train drivers should dare to take strong measures in time, and that trains without drivers should be deployed as soon as possible, in order to maintain timely stopping and combating illegal acts.
On October 1, the first day of the National Day holiday, vehicles increased rapidly through Sichuan North River Qiang Autonomous County to Songpan in Mao County.
At 1:00 p.m., police officers in Kitagawa received a call for help, saying that their family had been involved in a traffic accident in Songpan.
At the same time, the North River Tangjiashan堰塞湖环湖路 implements one-way traffic control, wants to ask the traffic police to release 120 ambulances.
After receiving the call for help, the CIVPOL quickly reported the situation to the brigade. Captain Huang learnt of the situation and immediately arranged for the CIVPOL to contact the applicants at the control point and requested them to do their best to carry out the escort work.
“There were more than 1,000 vehicles entering the control road at the time, and we arranged deployment immediately after contacting 120 ambulances, which were expected to arrive in Kitagawa at about 15 o’clock.”
In order to prevent double rows of vehicles that have already entered the section of the road from running in parallel, the policeman introduced the sectional control of vehicles at three points at the beginning, middle and end of the road one hour earlier, and reminded all passing drivers to leave the side of the road for the wrong vehicles for the ambulance.
Subsequently, the CIVPOL Troops temporarily stopped vehicles entering the controlled roads and lined up 120 ambulances that were about to arrive.
At 15 a.m., a river U-licensed ambulance entered the territory of Kitagawa, and the Kitagawa policeman sent a police car to the road, escorting the ambulance all the way back into the controlled section.
As it is known, only one vehicle passes through areas of Lake District Road, and the civilian police conducted temporary controls on these areas in advance, ensuring that 120 ambulances passed smoothly.
When they arrived at the village, there was a road that could not be left open, so the police contacted the village's two commissions in advance, borrowed the village's village road and banned social vehicles from entering the village.
“It took only 40 minutes to get 120 ambulances from the Kitagawa traffic police to the normal 302 provincial road.”
As usual, the entire passage of time takes four hours, he explained.
“This arrangement has secured a valuable time for the patient.”
It is reported that at 17:20, the critically injured patient was rushed to Mianyang for treatment.
The confirmed death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen rapidly to 832, with authorities fearing that the figure could rise as rescuers find it difficult to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact.
Particularly worrying is Donggra, a population of 300,000 in the area north of Baru, which is close to the earthquake.
Two other areas have lost contact with the outside world since Friday.
"We have not yet received reports from the other three regions.
Communications and electricity are still interrupted.
Nugroho said the missing included five foreigners, three of whom were French, one Korean and one Malaysian.
The earthquake and tsunami killed 832 people.
The death toll could rise to thousands, said Indonesia's Vice President, Mr. Karla.
Earlier, Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the disaster area and appealed for patience.
LONDON, November 4 (LETA) – The weekly British Daily Telegraph reported that Britain's departure minister, Dominique Raab, privately requested Britain's right to withdraw from Ireland's "safeguard" arrangements three months later.
The request was made to Irish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney at a private meeting in London on Tuesday, the report said.
The report noted that the request was “obviously contradictory” to the statement made three days later by British Cabinet Office Secretary David Lidington when he visited Dublin.
The UK departure ministry said it would not comment on private meetings.
At 8:05 a.m. yesterday morning, two suspected pickpocketers were arrested when they were pickpocketing at the 20th Street bus station from Yongchang Gate to Pearl City Gate.
The two thieves broke the passengers' coat pockets and stole $800 cash from them, leaving a policeman who had already squatted by to catch him.
This was the first pick-up by the Beijing police during National Day.
At more than five o'clock yesterday morning, the Beijing Public Security Mobile Investigation Team anti-pick detectives arrived at the prescribed location.
Based on past experience, the areas where traffic is concentrated, the bus hubs, and the bus lines, including Tiananmen Square, are the focus of their work.
In the flow of people, the civilian police in their uniforms observed the crowd calmly.
More than seven o'clock in the morning, detectives who were squatting at the bus station found two suspected men following a male passenger on a 20-lane bus from Yong Chengmen station.
In the car, two suspected men, left and right, locked the male passenger in the middle, one trying to cover up the other.
But they did not know that their own moves had already fallen into the eyes of the civilian policemen who watched.
The policeman, who was dressed as a policeman, waited for the men to steal. The policeman stared intently at the men who were preparing to steal, and was caught by the detective just after they had done so.
The police seized $800 in cash from the suspected thief, a reporter for the Beijing Morning Post observed.
"They took the money out of the passenger's pockets."
The police said, pointing to a broken coat pocket: “They cut it off and stole 800 yuan from a Beijing visitor, and when we caught them, the money had just been packed into their own pockets.”
The reporters learned that in order to catch the two men, the policeman walked for an hour and finally captured them at the time of the crime.
Two suspects are currently under police examination.
The question is simple for the civilian police, who can doubt in the crowd, told reporters.
“If you catch a thief more often, you’ll find that they’re different from ordinary passengers in their eyes, in their minds, and in their backpacks and pockets, and they’re more likely to dive into crowds than to hide from people.”
The police also told reporters that suspects often have no purpose in waiting for cars, preferring to wander around the stations, only after finding the pickup objects to follow them.
"It's all a matter of experience, and you'll know when the clothes are too dry and too long," he said.
In addition, the civilian police advised, “It’s the most convenient and the easiest to steal.”

On September 30, Xinhua News Agency (China News Agency) reported that three people were killed in a drunken driving accident in Tong Liao, Xinjiang province, after officials from the Tong Liao People's Democratic Party's propaganda department issued a message via Weibo, saying that the Standing Committee of the Tong Liao People's Democratic Party's Left-Central Flag Committee and the Minister of Publicity, Han Baie La, were involved in the accident.
On the afternoon of 29 September, the 52-year-old Korean Left and Chinese Flag Committee Standing Committee and Minister of Publicity Han Bai Ying-e-la, driving a small ordinary passenger car and an electric three-wheeler motorcycle in a traffic accident at the Victory North Road Racetrack, 1 km south of Tong Liao City Development Zone, caused the deaths of two people on the spot, one seriously injured, and died ineffectively by rescue.
It is understood that the suspected perpetrator, Mr. Han Bai-e-La, has been detained by the public security organs and investigated by the supervisory committee of the Liao City Committee of the Communist Party of China.
The case is currently under further investigation.
On October 1, the Transportation Authority of the Ministry of Public Security of China informed reporters that traffic flows on the periphery of major cities and highways rose sharply on the first day of National Day holiday. As of 17 o'clock on the day, there were no traffic delays except for a few intersections.
On the morning of the day, the traveling peak was generally observed in various parts of the country, and traffic flows on the periphery roads and highways of major cities rose significantly. Because of overflow, bottlenecks in the roads, scraping accidents, and other reasons such as toll stations, service areas, bridges, tunnels, intersections, and other intersections, the phenomenon of delayed queues of vehicles occurred to varying degrees.
It is known that on the first day of the holiday, the national police officers launched the holiday traffic safety wartime work, with a total of more than 190,000 people and 70,000 police vehicles, strict patrol control, strict traffic order, timely evacuation of traffic, rapid handling of accidents, widespread publicity tips, guidance, more and more arrangements, and all efforts to ensure the road safety smoothly on the first day of the holiday.
It is expected that traffic flows in and out of city highways and provincial roads will continue to run at high levels over the next two days, while traffic flows in tourist attractions will increase significantly, causing traffic congestion and increasing safety risks.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday called on her party to unite in support of her withdrawal, and directly urged critics to support her, saying the free trade agreements they hoped would be at the heart of her withdrawal.
On 30 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham.
At the start of the Conservative’s fierce annual meeting, Theresa May’s plan was once again attacked by two former cabinet ministers, including former foreign minister Johnson, who called her plan “flawed.”
But she also received strong support from other ministers who supported Brexit, who “praised Theresa May as one of the most polite people,” and from International Trade Minister Fox and Foreign Minister Hunt, who pointed their anger to the EU.
Theresa May’s already fragile leadership has come under further pressure this month, owing to the EU’s rejection of parts of the so-called “Chicks” plan.
But Theresa May has taken a positive view of these consultations, saying she is prepared to consider EU concerns.
“My message to my own party is, let’s work together to find the best deal for Britain,” said Theresa May.
Former British Foreign Minister Johnson called Theresa May’s plan “flawed” and attacked her lack of confidence in withdrawing from Europe.
He and former UK departure minister David Davis are pushing for a Canadian-style trade agreement with the EU.
Theresa May said the proposal would force Northern Ireland to implement different tariff provisions, splitting Northern Ireland from Britain.

Macron pushes France to declare itself a "long stick bread" Protect French Techniques - China New Net
Following Belgium's beer and the slices of Naples, Italy, France plans to apply for sticky bread to be included in the UNESCO's list of non-material cultural heritage, according to Reuters.
It was reported that the plan was spearheaded by French President Jacques Chirac and supported by the French Confederation of Bread and Cakes.
They pointed out that the breads sold now, many of which are made from large-scale frozen flour mixtures that incorporate ingredients other than flour, water, yeast and salt, are gradually becoming micro-manufactured, hoping to be included in the list of world-renowned French techniques.
UNESCO will hold an annual meeting in Mauritius in late November to review the list of non-material cultural heritage.
An illegal migrant ship sank in the Turkish Aegean Sea, killing five people.
A tanker loaded with illegal immigrants capsized in Turkey's Aegean Sea on September 30, killing at least five people, according to Turkish media.
The tanker, which was supposed to sail to an island in Greece, sank near Enez in the northwestern Turkish province of Edirne on the same day, and the cause of the sinking is unknown.
At present, it is not clear how many illegal immigrants are loaded on tankers.
Since it is estimated that there are still people trapped at sea, the search and rescue operations are still ongoing.
The Aegean Sea was the first choice route for illegal immigrants to the mainland of Europe through Turkey.
Turkey has significantly reduced the number of smugglers through the channel since it was brought under control under an agreement with the EU signed in March 2016.
But since this year, there has been a rebound in the number of smugglers on the channel.

Chinese tourists were beaten at Tai Airport: The shooter was fired The president of the airport was sacked.
A video of Chinese citizens being shot at Bangkok's Korman Airport has sparked widespread attention, according to a Thai newspaper.
At 2 p.m. local time, Su Linwa, president of the airport company Korman Airport, explained to the airport security officers about the incident and apologized.
On the other hand, Thailand's deputy prime minister, Mr. Ba'ath, reportedly attached great importance to the matter, ordered the dismissal of the airport staff responsible and dismissed the director of the airport.
At the time, the Chinese tourist was dissatisfied with the refusal to enter, unwilling to obey management and wait in the repatriation-limited area, and thus clashed with security personnel, said the director of the airport's administration.
Currently, the airport authority has suspended the security.
The incident has had an impact on Thailand's tourism image, and the airport has expressed its deep apologies for the incident. In an effort to compensate for the loss, the next airport will communicate its deep apologies to the attacked Chinese tourists through the Chinese Embassy.
Finally, Su Linwa, the airport's president, said the airport still welcomes Chinese tourists to Thailand, and has now provided more assistance and convenience to Chinese tourists entering Thailand, including the opening of a special Chinese passport service at the time of entry, including the opening of 18 airports, 21 airports in Kuala Lumpur, 18 airports in Phuket, 8 airports in Chiang Mai, and 10 special Chinese tourists at Ai Airport.
Thailand's top news portal The new Director General of the State Immigration Bureau of Thailand, former Deputy Director General of the State Tourism Police of Thailand, Lieutenant General Suen Lache, has been informed that the deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, Mr Ba'ath, has attached great importance to the matter, has ordered the dismissal of the airport staff responsible, and has withdrawn the investigation of the director of Korman Airport.
In recent years, there have been many instances of campus plastic runway failures.
To this end, the Ministry of Education has issued a notice requiring the implementation of a new national mark on surface sports grounds for primary and secondary schools using synthetic materials to be delivered after 1 November this year.
The compulsory national standard on surface sports grounds for synthetic materials in primary and secondary schools was drafted by the Ministry of Education with the participation of 26 scientific institutes and testing bodies. Over the course of more than two years of revision, more than 100 expert meetings were organized during the period, as well as field inspections and sampling tests throughout the country, and hundreds of verification experiments of enterprise products were collected in the market.
In contrast to the old national standards of 2005, reporters found that the new national standards not only changed from “National Recommended Standards” to “National Mandatory Standards,” but also added a number of elements, including thickness requirements, physical performance, aging resistance, inorganic filling content requirements, high polymer content requirements for anti-slide glue particles, limits on harmful substances in surface products, and limits on harmful substances in non-solid and solid raw materials.
It is particularly noteworthy that the new national mark limits the harmful substances that can be produced in the construction of the campus plastic runway, from the original seven to 18, and according to household standards the limits on the volatile organic matter of the runway built.
For example, the release quantities of harmful substances are clearly specified in the "Harmful substances Limits and Odor Requirements in Current Cast and Precast Surface Products", requiring that total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/m3, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 mg/m3, carbon dioxide should not exceed 7 mg/m3, benzene should not exceed 0.1 mg/m3, and the odor rating should not exceed 3.
The new national mark also makes detailed provisions on the sampling requirements, inspection rules and judgment rules of plastic runways in primary and secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial grass is also included for the first time in the mandatory testing scope of the national standards.
In the near future, special work will be deployed around the country on the implementation of the new national standards, and the implementation of the new national standards will be reported to the Department of Sport, Health and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.
In the afternoon of September 30, 2018, at the Women's World Cup finals in Chengdu, China, the "Kingdom Ping Internal War" took place.
At the end of the match, the teammate Zhu Yuling, who had won the match 4–0 against the Yankees at home, finished four years later at the top of the Women's World Cup, the 21st time that the Chinese women's team had won the title.
Tinning and Zhu Yuling are both teammates and friends, both of whom are quite familiar with each other's tactics.
Whether ready to fight or ready to play, both sides are in shape.
When they entered the finals, the two men did not make a deal and stated that they had finished the match.
But in the competition between Tinning and Zhu Yuling, the amount is as good as a sword sword shadow.
In the first round, Tinning, who had the best experience in the competition, was 3–1 ahead, and then Zhu Yuling used Tinning's mistakes to keep the score to 3 points.
In the second half of the match, he scored a 3–9 lead and took the lead by 10–6.
Despite a three-point lead, Tinning scored his first goal 11–9.
In the second round, Zhu Yuling's errors remained high, and Tinning was far ahead with a 6:1 advantage in the match.
Zhu was 2–7 behind, relying on a rhythmic change to score 2 points, and then used an attack to bring the score to 8–9.
At the crucial moment, Dinning scored a 2–11–8 victory.
In the third round, the two men started the game with a 3–3 tie.
Dinning subsequently scored three points in three more attacks, but she then scored three points in a six-point lead against Rhinoceros.
Zhu Yuling scored 2 points again, and took the lead with 10:8.
But Dinning attacked extremely aggressively, finishing 4 points down 12:10 to take the third place.
In the fourth round, Zhu started with a 4–2 lead.
But after that, Tinning showed a super strong offensive state, joined after 4 minutes to stop Zhu Yuling.
After the suspension came back, Zhu Yuling recovered some positions, gradually catching the score to 8:8.
At the crucial moment, Tinning did not play softly and scored two points.
With Zhu Yuling returning to the field, Tinning 4:0 swept away the opponent to win.
Last month, Tinning won the title at the Bulgarian Open, ending her 14-month-long championship run, which came to Chengdu, although she said she had not set a goal for the competition before the match, and in the morning's semi-finals, Tinning said she had accomplished the task.
She expressed satisfaction with her performance by defeating her teammate, Zhu Yuling, and winning her third individual World Cup championship: "A championship is important for every athlete.
I didn’t think of it before the game, just said to play a game, and I was very satisfied with the final.”
“I think I can handle the pressure all the way through the game, and Dinning's performance today is very good, which has led to me not finding a rhythm,” she said as she talked about whether the enthusiastic spectators at home would cause intangible stress to themselves.
In order to stimulate rural consumption, it is necessary to purify the market by normalization mechanism, guide healthy consumption demand, and raise farmers' sense of consumption.
The data shows that rural residents’ potential for consumption continues to be unleashed, with the retail volume of rural consumer goods growing by 10.5% in the first half of this year, up 1.3 percentage points from that of urban areas.
A poor village in a western county visited, where there was only one convenience store, and entered the store, where some goods appeared to be familiar, "Kinglong fish" was labeled "Kinglong oil," "Wangchai" became "Wang milk," and many "Jiangzhai" goods.
In recent years, similar phenomena have been exposed over and over again, some rural fake fake goods side brands, names are similar, packaging is similar, false false truth, and preventable.
A consumer survey published in a western city showed that the problem of over-the-country merchants was serious, with 66% of consumers buying counterfeit goods in supermarkets outside towns and cities, and more than half of them buying food.
The departments concerned to regulate the rural market, year after year shouting, why the "Li ghost" still beat repeatedly?
Unlike urban markets, farmers' awareness of their rights is relatively weak, coupled with many rural locations far away, in the blind areas that do not have sufficient regulatory power, give fake goods fertile soil.
One commodity has many heads, some departments have prices, some have production, some have markets, cross-functional, year-on-year, year-on-year, concentrated governance winds, fake goods hide from the winds, and slowly emerge, just after the old, new, and emerging.
The lack of long-term regulatory mechanisms, the difficulty of purifying rural markets, low illegal costs, and high profits have led some illicit traders to distort the mindset of “up and down the countryside,” and some rural areas have become “dismantled markets.”
From moderate to moderate, the vast majority of farmers are moving towards developmental consumption.
A few days ago, the Central Committee and the State Council issued a number of opinions on improving the mechanisms for promoting the consumption system to further stimulate the potential of residents' consumption, which proposed promoting the gradual upgrading of rural residents' consumption, with the aim of enabling the vast majority of farmers to "consume," "consume willingly," "consume boldly," and to make rural consumption truly flourish.
On the one hand, it is necessary to deepen the reforms, eliminate the many-faced and multi-headed management of market supervision, and, where appropriate, improve the food safety and quality supervision network, and constantly compress the space for rural counterfeiting and selling counterfeiting.
On the other hand, if law enforcement is to be strengthened to regulate “fine blood vessels,” it must not allow fakes to spread in rural areas.
The strict punishment of the peasants is the protection of the peasants, whether the counterfeiters hide much more hidden, should not be the reason for the birth of fake inferior goods, the relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, the grass-roots supervisory powers sink down, which link of the problem, should investigate the responsibility, let the counterfeiters and the sellers nowhere hide.
Strictly entering the market, strictly examining the qualifications of producers and operators, entering and exiting the market, ensuring that the products are in good condition and clear condition, thinking from the source and roots, ensuring that legitimate traders operate safely, and ensuring that farmers buy with confidence.
To stimulate rural consumption, we must guide the demand for healthy consumption.
With the increase in consumption, many farmers are not only pursuing a high-quality life that is not only full of food and good food, but also of culture and health, and cannot compare the rural market with “low-quality” and “low-cost.”
This requires promoting the expansion of e-commerce coverage to the vast rural areas, facilitating the two-way linked sales channels between rural and urban areas, promoting the integration of industry platforms and online retailers' trading platforms, supporting the expansion of new modes of consumption to rural markets, promoting the organic integration of commercial and trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, product processing, etc. in townships with the conditions, and improving the modern distribution network system in rural areas, optimizing the integration of storage facilities and resources, and effectively reducing the cost of rural distribution.
To create a clean and peaceful market environment for the countryside, so that farmers consumption does not get caught up, rural consumption can become more and more prosperous, can increase farmers consumption's sense of availability and happiness.
With effect from November 1, the tariff rate for the least-favoured-country goods in China will be reduced to 7.5%
In accordance with the decision of the 26th Ordinary Meeting of the State Council, the Customs and Excise Code Committee of the State Council issued a notice on 30 November 2018, reducing the maximum benefit country tax rate for some goods from 1 November 2018.
In accordance with the Notice of the Customs and Excise Code Committee of the State Council on the Reduction of Import Tariffs for Parts of Goods, in order to adapt to the needs of industrial upgrading, lowering the cost of enterprises and meeting the multi-layered consumption of the masses, the most-favoured-nation tax rate for such goods as industrial goods will be reduced from 1 November this year.
A total of 1,585 duties were reduced on goods, accounting for about 19% of the total duties in our country, with an average rate of 10.5% down to 7.8% and an average reduction of 26%.
The tax reduction relates mainly to textiles; stone, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; mechanical and electrical equipment and parts such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machinery, electrical transmission equipment, electrical engineering equipment, instrumentation apparatus, etc.; resource goods and primary processing products such as non-metallic minerals, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper products, gemstones, etc.
At the same time, with the lowering of the total tariff level, especially the tariff on imports of drugs and daily consumables, the corresponding lowering of the tax rate on imports of imported goods.
In order to implement the decision-making deployment of the Central Committee and the State Council, China has implemented zero tariffs on the vast majority of imported drugs from 1 May this year, reduced import tariffs on automobiles and components and some daily consumer goods from 1 July, and implemented a third step of tax reduction on information technology enlargement agreement products.
The Customs and Excise Code Committee of the State Council has learned that China's overall tariff level will fall from 9.8% last year to 7.5%, with an average reduction of 23%, following a series of autonomous adjustments since this year.
The appropriate reduction of tariffs is conducive to the balanced development of foreign trade, the promotion of a higher level of openness to the outside world, the co-ordination of the utilization of both domestic and international resources, and the promotion of structural reforms on the domestic supply side.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening-up, and the initiative to reduce the overall level of tariffs is a practical step in implementing the spirit expressed by the Chinese President during his speech at the Boao Asia Forum. It is also an important step in China's need to further expand its opening-up and initiative to expand imports, and it shows that China will remain firmly committed to a mutually beneficial open-up strategy, while enhancing its own development momentum and enabling China's development to benefit the world better.
On September 29, a public branding press conference for the agricultural products of "Zongxiang people" in Zhong County, Gansu Province was held in the southern open area of Tianjin City.
Red Army millet, black beans, mountain goats, black sheep, refined bitter buckwheat tea, cutting-edge leather booklets, pure hand-to-shoulder ... ... A neatly packaged agricultural product is displayed on the stand, and they have a common brand name called "The Countryside People."
"The creation of a regional brand for rural farmers has effectively solved the bottlenecks in the development of rural agricultural products, which are "scattered and small and weak," and has become a powerful vehicle for tackling poverty," said a public launch of the regional brand for rural farmers, organized by Gansu County, in the southern opening district of Tianjin City.
The district is located at the intersection of the three provinces of Shanxi and Ganning, as "the country's advanced food production county" "the country of China's small grains" "the country of China's shadows" , with a long history and rich resources.
Local snacks such as lamb meat, yellow rice wine, buckwheat slices, oatmeal, etc. are often remembered by tourists in his countryside.
As the level of urbanization in China increases rapidly, the urban population increases rapidly, and a large number of rural young people leave the countryside to start living in the city.
“Nowadays, the pace of urban life is fast and the pressure is high, and more and more people are beginning to remember their childhood in the countryside,” says China’s agricultural brand research expert Yang Qianjia.
The climatic conditions of the district are special, the sunlight is long, the day and night temperatures are different, the characteristic small grain cultivation conditions are sunny and thick.
It produces more than 20 kinds of small grains in China, and is the largest producer of small grains in Gansu.
Wang Xiaoli, a girl from Zhongcheng County, Tianjin, who attended the event as a volunteer, said: “The people of Zhongcheng are the most beloved and the taste of their hometown is the most beautiful.
Dr. Tan Bin, a researcher at the National Food and Materials Reserve Board's Science Research Institute, said that through the testing of more than 900 sets of index data, the advantages of the test data of various agricultural products such as buckwheat, bitter buckwheat, black beans in Zhongzhou county stand out, and the content of many physiological active substances is higher than the standard data.
Chai Chun, secretary of the county committee, said that the release of the brand "Zongxiang people" can further improve the quality of quality agricultural products, standardization and scaled innovation development levels in Zongxiang, which will help shape the good overall image of Zongxiang agricultural products, and rapidly raise the visibility, competitiveness and added value.
In July, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.2 per cent over the previous month, higher than expected, raising market expectations that the Central Bank of Canada would raise interest rates next month.
If raised, it would be the central bank’s fifth raise in more than a year.
Analysts who visited Reuters previously predicted growth of 0.1%.
The Canadian Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that 12 of the 20 industries were growing.
The data is noteworthy because the central bank earlier this month predicted that temporary factors might drag GDP data into the third quarter.
Chairman of the Central Bank of Canada, Paul Boltz, pledged Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates gradually and closely monitor economic data.
The next time the Central Bank of Canada announces interest rates, the decision will be made on October 24.
With Canada’s economy strengthening and unemployment close to record lows, the Central Bank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 2017.
Stephen Brown, a senior Canadian economist at Keynote Macro, says the country's GDP growth is expected to reach around 2 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter.
“This will be higher than the central bank’s forecast of 1.5%, which would be another reason to expect the central bank to raise interest rates next month,” he said in a report.
The market’s forecast for the Canadian Central Bank’s October rate hike rose from 76.46 per cent to 78.27 per cent, according to the Internight Exchange.
The first joint exploration of Hanjiang into the sea in 65
South Korea's Ministry of Defence confirmed on 5 May that the Koreans had launched joint inspections into the waters of the mouth of the Han River and Linz River that day.
The initiative is a preliminary preparation for safeguarding the free movement of civilian vessels on both sides.
South Korea's Ministry of Defence reported to the media on the day that this was the first joint inspection of Hanjiang's entrance into the sea since the signing of the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement.
The Koreans signed a military agreement in September this year, and agreed to jointly explore waters such as the Han River into the sea in November to ensure future environmental protection and tourism development.
In October, the Koreans planned joint water exploration at a general-level meeting.
On 5 November, the joint South Korean waters expedition was officially launched.
The joint mission was composed of 20 experts, including the Korean army and experts.
According to the South Korean Ministry of Defence, both sides did not carry weapons during the inspection and were forbidden to use provocative statements.
“Because there is no military boundary near the entrance to the seaport, the region has been an accidental highway, but through joint inspections it will become a new peaceful zone in the future.”
The total length of the joint Korean-Korean expedition is about 70 km, with a total area of about 280 km2.
The South Korean Ministry of Defence said it would send six exploratory vessels to conduct surveys of sea depths, etc., to provide basic information for safe navigation in the waters, and to provide navigational maps for civilian vessels once the survey is completed.
The Koreans had held a summit meeting in Pyongyang in October 2007 to reach an agreement on the joint use of the Han River and the Linz River for the entrance into the sea, but subsequent negotiations were delayed due to tensions on the peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by the Koreans in September, future ships of both sides will need to inform each other in advance of their joint waters voyages.
On November 5, China's citizens Guo Yusei and Mao Ruin lost contact during a trip to Mongolia, according to the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia's website on Thursday.
On October 19, the two members of the Blue Sky rescue team contacted their local friends, saying they were going to explore the mountains near Lake Kuzukur, and shared their location via Weibo.
The Embassy of China in Mongolia has always attached great importance to the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of citizens of Mongolia and their security, and to consular protection and assistance.
Following the news of the loss of the two tourists, the Embassy immediately launched a contingency insurance plan, striving to seize the golden rescue time and do its utmost.
The Embassy maintains close contact with the family members of the parties, assists the family members to report to the Mon Police immediately, and provides the family members with a list of translations for their choice.
The Embassy first met with the heads of the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Relations, the General Police Administration and the General Emergency Situations Administration to inform them of the relevant situation and to request Mongolia to carry out search and rescue as soon as possible, and to maintain close communication with Mongolia throughout the search and rescue process, ensuring timely access to the latest developments.
At the same time, the Embassy assisted family members to publish search and rescue messages in Mon, and extensively launched expatriates and Chinese-owned enterprises in Mon to actively participate in search and rescue, providing effective clues, and provided relevant assistance to a number of Blue Sky rescue personnel who went to Mon to assist and rescue.
With the strong impetus of the embassy, Monsanto dispatched a rescue team at the earliest opportunity and pledged to exempt search and rescue costs.
The General Police Department of Mon and the General Emergency Department of Quebec instructed the Police and Emergency Department of Quebec to search and rescue fully.
Due to the remote, sparsely populated, highly inconvenienced transportation and communications in the northern Mongolian border with Russia, and the fact that Mongolia is now experiencing severe winters with temperatures below zero to minus 20 degrees Celsius, the local police and emergency departments overcame enormous difficulties, nearly mobilizing all police forces, and mobilizing local shepherds, through horseback riding, walking, visiting shepherds, etc., to carry out carpet searches throughout a wide range of areas around the two disconnected locations.
At the same time, in response to the special circumstances of the ranch, Montfort has been broadcasting a series of enlightenment messages for many years.
Domestic Blue Sky rescue team personnel have also been actively involved in the rescue in Mon with the Mon side.
The safety of the two disbanded personnel has always touched our hearts.
To date, the two have been missing for more than ten days, and the embassy has received further clues, but the two have not been found, and the search and rescue operations are still under way.
The Embassy will continue to pay attention to the matter in accordance with the principle of "people-centred" and will continue to promote the full search and rescue efforts of the parties and provide maximum assistance to the families of the parties concerned.
The Embassy appeals to compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia at the earliest opportunity if they learn relevant clues.
Former bodyguards claimed that Michael Jackson had put a tape on his nose to cover the headlines
The former bodyguard of Michael Jackson claimed that the late singer had intentionally committed some bizarre acts aimed at inciting the media.
Matt Fitzgerald, who is now a real estate developer and owner of a martial arts/dance chain, reported to The Greater Boston Post that Jackson believed that if he was no longer "a mystery" in the public's eyes, his personal fascination would stop.
He was reported to wear a mask and put a rubber band on his nose in order to make headlines.
We'll tell you the truth. You can have your own opinion.
"He knows how to manipulate the media, he knows how to get to the top of the news," said Fitz, a 10-year-old Jackson bodyguard who wears a mask on his face, or glues it to his hand, or glues it to his nose (which he likes the most), and 90% of the time it works.
"It's very sad," he added, "but it goes against the wishes.
Fitzgerald also referred to the allegations of child abuse made by Wade Robson and James Sevchark against Jackson, which have been aired in the controversial Emmy Award-winning documentary "Departing Dream Island".
Both Robson and Jeff Chack claimed to have been abused by Jackson since their childhood.
Fitz claimed, "The whole thing about childhood addiction is a bunch of crap ... this guy has a lot of girlfriends, and he's legally married to Lisa Mary Presley, and that's his life."
He claimed that it was "impossible" for Jackson to abuse children on the Dream Island ranch because he "nearly" did not stay on the farm.
"They say there are a couple of boys around, but it's not true," he said.
The Jackson Winery denied all charges against the late star. Jackson denied all charges against him before his death in 2009.
Another 15 tax officials have retired due to corruption
New Delhi:
In its fourth round of action against suspected corruption and other misconduct, the government also forced 15 tax officials to retire.
According to official reports, the Central Intermediate Tax and Customs Commission, which is responsible for supervising the collection of goods and services taxes and import taxes under Article 56(J) of the Basic Rules, has been compelled to require the retirement of 15 senior officials on corruption and other charges.
This is the fourth round of dismissal of corrupt tax officials since June this year. In the first three rounds, 49 tax officials were forced to retire, including 12 officials from the Central Direct Tax Commission.
According to sources, the move was in line with Prime Minister Modi's speech to the nation in Redburg, where he said some of the harmful horses in the tax department could abuse power and harass taxpayers, either against honest assessment targets or by taking excessive action against minor or procedural irregularities.
"We have recently taken strong measures to compel a significant number of tax officials to retire, and we will not tolerate that," he said.
Nearly half of the retired officials are those arrested by the Central Investigation Bureau of India for allegedly receiving illegal benefits. One of them was arrested for bribing RUB 15,000. One official was charged with unknown sources of massive assets.
In June this year, the Government forced the retirement of 15 Central Intermediate Tax and Customs Commission Commissioner-level officials on charges of corruption, bribery, smuggling and even conspiracy to commit crimes. Previously, the Government had forced the retirement of 12 senior officials of the State Tax Offices of the Ministry of Income Tax on charges of corruption, sexual harassment and large unaccounted-for assets under Article 56(J) of the Central Civil Service (Retirement) Rules.
In August, the Government forced the retirement of 22 Central Interim Tax and Customs Commission officials. Article 56(J) of the Central Civil Servants (Retirement) Rules of 1972 provided for periodic review of the performance of government civil servants in order to determine whether they should remain in office or retire in accordance with the public interest.
In accordance with those provisions, the situation of government employees, as provided for in Articles 56(J), 56(1) or 48(1)(b) of the Basic Rules of 1972, should be reviewed six months before they reach the age of 50-55, if they meet the requirements set out in Article 56(J) of the Basic Rules of 1972, as well as the requirements set out in Article 56(1) or 48 of the Central Civil Service (Retirement) Rules of 1972, when they have completed 30 years of service.
A woman in Maine received 500 letters from Joint Health Insurance within five days
Stephanie Ray said her mailbox was bombed from Thursday to Monday by a mailbox from an insurance company.
"Since the first wave last Thursday, I have received 46 letters," she told the cable news network. "I immediately called United Health Insurance and informed them that I had received 46 letters of the same content.
But letters followed, reaching over 500 as of Monday.
The letters were sent to her son, who lives in a private nursing home with autism, she explained, but the letter did not mention her son's name, but said "Dear Maine Department of Health and Public Services, Cincinnati," she told local media.
These letters relate to claims outside the scope of joint health insurance coverage of $54 or $0, Ms. Ray said.
When she asked why she had received so many letters from the Joint Health Insurance, she was told it was because there was a code problem, she said.
Joint Health Insurance, in its statement, informed cable news networks that they were addressing the issue and could not provide more details due to privacy requirements.
"We have identified the root of the problem. We apologize for the incident and we have contacted the person and asked them about it," said the health insurance company.
At the bottom of each letter, Ms. Ray says, there is a message calling for people to become paperless. "I think the letters they send have wasted half a forest of trees," she says.
Antonio Brown says he is not ready for retirement yet
Antonio Brown has said he will not retire from the National Football League (NFL), and just a few days ago he tweeted exclaiming he had left the NFL.
The four-year-old full-time receiver tweeted on Thursday, "I'm in good shape, why I'm retiring now," and accepted the advice that the game needed.
Brown has been accused of sexual abuse by two women and was released by the New England Patriots last week after a game. Anthony Brown has been abandoned by three different teams over the past six months.
Brown, who lost his Nike sponsorship last week, said he would start in Miami and train one day a week in high school.
Brown, 31, also had a quarrel on Twitter with security guard Eric Wedler of the Los Angeles Sheep, who often clashed with him when he was playing for the Mowboys in Bar.
HSBC Launches New Business with Transform Crime Detection Tool
The UK's HSBC Holdings Group has converted algorithms used to detect financial crime into new business opportunities, which it was forced to build early on due to money laundering scandals, said the bank's chief executive.
The system combines relevant data on customer banking operations with public data on company ownership and directorship positions to identify appropriate potential customers for HSBC staff and provide a way to communicate with these customers through existing customer relationships.
HSBC's overall revenue strategy is to seek more revenue from its large-scale physical networks and customer data, and the use of data and artificial intelligence to try to increase revenue is part of that strategy.
"This is the first time that financial crime prevention investments have been used for commercial purposes, and the business itself is low-risk and fast-growing," said Stuart Nevison, global head of HSBC's customer network bank.
HSBC declined to disclose how much the new system is expected to yield, but said the overall "network gains" initiative has yielded hundreds of millions of dollars in additional gains.
This is another important step in HSBC's efforts to maintain its global operations, as some analysts and investors have suggested the bank should scale down or withdraw from profits below the capital cost in markets such as the US.
In 2012, HSBC reached a $19 billion settlement agreement with US authorities over its failure to stop drug dealers from laundering money through its Mexican subsidiary, part of which included billions of dollars that had been forced to be invested in financial crime regulation.
By mapping the relationship between individual customers and companies, finding abnormal trading patterns, or exploring previously unknown links between the two, the system can realize its design intentions.
The system has liberated more than 400 employees from the need to manually verify transactions and record transactions and to take on more customer-focused service, said Adrian Rigby, chief operating officer of HSBC's trading operations.
Nivenson of HSBC pointed out that they suddenly realized that if the tool was slightly modified, it could be used to search for more attractive potential customers' "small green flags" rather than the "small red flags" for illegal activities.
"We have obtained a set of customer data, combined it with the company's (UK) registered office data, and reversed the previous algorithm to look for customer potential, which could be achieved by linking the registered office, the company's development, or existing customers," Nivenson said.
The tool has mapped 22.5 million UK entities and individuals and can identify a link network in three minutes, while bank staff often take three hours to manually create the map, he said.
Iran has been promised that the US will lift "all" sanctions in exchange for dialogue, Ruhani says
European countries are eager to negotiate with Iran and have hinted that the US would end sanctions on Iran if Tehran were willing to engage in dialogue, President Hassan Rouhani said.
According to Rouhani, European signatories to the 2015 IAEA agreement urged him to meet with US President Donald Trump, pledging Washington to lift “all” sanctions in exchange for dialogue.
"Three of the six countries - the German prime minister, the British prime minister and the French president - insisted on holding the meeting and said the United States would lift all sanctions," the Iranian president said.
He said he rejected the proposal because the negotiations would be conducted "under the utmost pressure and sanctions of the United States against Iran" and would have no predictable outcome.
Trump quickly denied having offered any relief to Iran, and stated on Twitter that Tehran had asked him to lift the sanctions as a condition for dialogue, but “of course” refused.
"We have discussed a number of issues with countries, and all countries have condemned the withdrawal of the United States from the Comprehensive Plan of Action and its crackdown, which is a huge success for Iran," he said in a statement.
Government launches consultation on review of dog breeding law
Due to concerns about animal mismanagement and owner misconduct, the Scottish dog breeding law is under review.
The Government of Scotland has launched an advisory process to seek public opinion.
The Scottish Minister for Community Safety committed to "ensuring community safety and keeping people away from unaccountable owners" in order to determine whether there was a need to amend legislation against unaccountable dogs.
"We are reviewing the dog breeding law twice because we are absolutely determined to ensure community safety and keep people away from blameless dog owners and their uncontrolled dogs," said Scottish MP Ash Dunham.
The consultation is aimed at seeking advice on how to improve the implementation of the 2010 Canine Control Act in Scotland. Next year, we will review all the Canine Control Acts more extensively to assess whether they need to be amended.
淚 encourage everyone who is interested in this area to respond to our opinion polls,?he said, adding that raising dogs brings certain responsibilities, including keeping your dog under effective control.
The public consultation will continue until 15 January, including proposals to strengthen and clarify existing legislation, such as whether a national dog control database should be established.
The Scottish Parliament's legislature's post-election commissioners have been hearing testimony from victims and parents of dog attacks or killings and have urged the government to review dog-raising legislation.
Members of the Scottish Parliament were informed that there was an urgent need to reform legislation to protect vulnerable groups and children.
The Committee was informed that, last year alone, in Glasgow and Cleveland, 1417 people, including 255 children, were taken to hospital emergency departments after being bitten by dogs.
912 people were treated by the National Health Service in Lanark County and 439 by the National Health Service in Ell County, both of which were the highest number of people treated in four years.
In July, members of the Committee concluded that the current dog breeding law was not in line with the objectives and called on the Government of Scotland to carry out a comprehensive review of all dog breeding law.
"There are still a lot of cases of dog attacks against children, but the existing laws that could prevent such attacks have hardly been implemented or understood," said commission chief Jenny Mara.
"It is obvious that the current dog-raising legislation has not worked. There is an urgent need for reform in order to deal properly with uncontrolled and dangerous dogs, and we can try to establish a system to prevent our children from being hurt by dogs.
The advisory was released on the government's website on Friday as follows: "Unified effective enforcement is key to solving the Scottish problem of uncontrolled dogs.
The review focused on the measures that could be taken to assist local authorities and other assistance implementing bodies to use their powers to safeguard community security.
For the first time, Saudi Arabia has introduced a travel visa and abolished the ban on Arabian gowns
Currently, Saudi visas are only issued to foreign employees, their families, and Muslim pilgrims.
Saudi Arabia said Friday it would provide tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holiday travellers to promote economic diversification and reduce dependence on oil.
Launching the tourism sector is one of the core elements of the 2030 Vision for Reform by King Mohammed bin Salman, which aims to prepare the Arab economy for the largest post-oil era development.
Just two weeks ago, the US government accused Iran of launching a devastating attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil infrastructure, which has disrupted global energy markets and raised concerns about a wider regional conflict.
"Opening up Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for my country," Secretary for Tourism Ahmed Hadib said in a statement.
"Visitors will admire ... the treasures we share -- the five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the vibrant local culture and the breathtaking natural beauty.
Saudi Arabia will open online travel visa applications to citizens from 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg quoted Hadib as saying.
Hadib said Saudi Arabia would also relax strict dress codes for foreign women, allowing them not to wear wrapped Abaia robes, which are still the public clothes Saudi women must wear.
He added, however, that foreign women would be asked to wear "simple clothes", but did not elaborate.
In this desert kingdom, which has numerous Bedouin monuments and archaeological sites, visas are currently restricted to foreign employees, their families and Muslim pilgrims to the Sacred Places of Mecca and Medina.
Saudi Arabia began granting temporary visas to tourists last year to allow them to participate in sports and cultural activities in order to kick-start the tourism industry, a rare move.
But this serious kingdom prohibits alcohol consumption and has strict social norms, which are seen by many as obstacles to tourism.
Prince Mohammed is trying to change this by means of a comprehensive liberalization movement, which has brought new cinemas, mixed-sex concerts and sporting parties to Saudi Arabia.
Observers say the international community's criticism of Saudi human rights records, including last year's appalling assassination of critic Jamal Khashoggi and repression of women activists, could further disincentivize foreign tourists.
Concerns about regional conflicts may also weaken Saudi Arabia’s attractiveness to tourists after the September 14 attacks on state-owned oil giant Amoil.
Prepared for the impact of low oil prices, the government said it hoped that by 2030, tourism would contribute 10 per cent of GDP, compared to only 3 per cent at present.
According to 2030, Saudi Arabia’s goal is to attract more than 100 million foreign and domestic tourists annually.
But Saudi Arabia currently lacks infrastructure to accommodate so many tourists, and officials estimate that the country will need an additional 500,000 hotel rooms in the next decade.
The government says the tourism industry is expected to create up to 100,000 jobs as it copes with high youth unemployment rates in high-business enterprises.
Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to start tourism from scratch.
In 2017, Saudi Arabia announced a multi-billion-dollar project to turn 50 islands and other primitive sites of the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
Last year, the Kiddia Entertainment City was launched near Riyadh, which will include a high-end theme park, car sports facilities and a hunting area.
The country is also developing historical monuments, such as the hundred-year-old Mardanshahr, which is the site of a sandstone mausoleum that was left behind by the same civilization that built the city of Jordanpetra.
Facebook hides a "thank you" number in a new Australian test
Facebook said today it has begun to hide the dynamic number of "thank you" points published in Australia, a test designed to alleviate social pressure and later to be widely distributed worldwide.
From now on, face book users in Australia will no longer be able to see the number of dynamic reactions and video views posted by others, but will still be able to see people's dynamic reactions to themselves.
"We don't want people to feel like it's a game with faces," he said.
"We want to test people's use of the new version, and we'd like to take some time to look at user feedback to see if it can be promoted," the company said.
FaceBook users worldwide exceed a billion, but the social media giant is also under pressure to prevent the platform's impact on users' psychological health.
According to the Australian cybersecurity commissioner, one-fifth of children in Australia report experiencing online violence.
Before making that decision, Facebook tested a hidden version of the app on its other important social media – the photo wall – in July.
Testing of photo walls began in Canada, and then expanded to Australia, Brazil, and other major consumer markets.
Facebook said the test was to "understand some things as early as possible through a small-scale test."
"Although we've been testing the photo walls, Facebook and (the photo wall) are different platforms, so we might get different test data," the company said.
Social media giants have not confirmed how long the test will last.
"We'd like to see if dropping a few points would improve user experience and limit other positive interactions," said Mia Garrick, head of Facebook Australia.
Lorenzo intensified into a Category 4 hurricane in the eastern Caribbean
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Lawrence intensified into a Category 4 hurricane Thursday, with the hurricane's powerful waves likely to affect the wind islands and parts of South America.
At 11 p.m. National Hurricane Centre time, the eye of the hurricane is about 1660 miles southwest of the Azores. Eastern summer time updates. The storm moves north-west at 14 miles per hour, with a maximum sustained wind of 145 miles per hour.
The storm is not expected to make landfall in the next few days, but a northeastward turn on Saturday could bring Lorenza closer to the Azores in the next week. Forecasters forecast it to weaken to below 3 degrees on Monday.
The storm's massive waves could cause life-threatening waves and surges to the wind islands and northeastern South America.
Lorenzo was the second hurricane in the Atlantic hurricane season to reach a Category 4 or higher. Dorian reached a Category 5 near the Bahamas.
According to Florida State University meteorologist Philip Krausbach, 16 named storms have occurred in the Western Hemisphere (including the Atlantic and East Pacific Basin) since August 21.
Philip Krausbach wrote on Twitter: "This was the most named storm recorded in the Western Hemisphere between August 21 and September 21, breaking the old record of 15 named storms between 1984 and 2002.
Iran's Patriotic Missile System Arrives in Saudi Arabia After Attack on Oil Facilities
After routine inspections of Patriot missile batteries at the Turkish military base in Gaziantep, Turkey, American soldiers have been discussing.
The Pentagon announced Thursday that the United States plans to deploy a Patriot missile battery, a radar system and about 200 support personnel to Saudi Arabia due to the attacks on Saudi oil facilities earlier this month.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman wrote in a statement that Defence Minister Mark Esper had "approved the deployment of additional troops" "although no decision has yet been taken on the deployment of additional troops, but they will remain in high alert."
Increased troops included two patriotic artillery batteries and a final high-altitude area defence system, also known as the Sadd anti-missile system.
The SED is one of the most sophisticated missile systems in the world, capable of targeting and destroying an attacking missile in the air. The SED interceptor is launched by a launch vehicle, and uses kinetic energy to "collide and destroy" the ballistics threat.
"It is important that these moves demonstrate our commitment to regional partners and to security and stability in the Middle East, where others have accused Iran of causing disasters in the region, but we hope they can help strengthen Saudi defence capabilities," Hoffman wrote.
President Donald Trump has criticized Iran's role in attacking Saudi oil facilities, the United Nations General Assembly said on Tuesday, saying they should pressure Tehran to engage in diplomatic negotiations.
“All countries have a responsibility to act. No responsible government should fund the killing of Iran. If Iran does not stop its dangerous practices, sanctions will not be lifted, but only more severely,” Trump said in an appeal against Iran’s actions.
On September 14, strikes at the world's largest oil refineries and fields forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half of its production operations, prompting the U.S. drone strike, the largest surge in crude oil prices in decades, and again raising concerns about conflicts in the Middle East. While widely believed that Tehran should be responsible for the attack, the Iranian side has consistently maintained that it was not involved.
Tech Parachutist Kills Large Tractor on California Highway
The 28-year-old woman and seven others jumped around 2 p.m. Thursday, California Highway Patrol Public Information Officer Ruben Jones told the cable news network.
These people took off from the Lodi Parachute Center. The United States cable television news network has contacted the agency to comment.
Jones said the woman crashed into a truck as the parachute team landed near Lodi Airport when the wind was strong.
The station interviewed Lisa Reyes, who was driving on Highway 99 with her father and brother when the woman crashed.
The man was struggling in the wind, but her body was falling very, very quickly, she told the TV.
Child rape perpetrators are ordered to face the victims in court
In May 2017, the man, dressed in a fancy tree-leaf costume, grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into the bushes on her way to a school on the Central Coast.
He then tied the girl to the tree and sexually assaulted her.
Shortly after his arrest, the police searched his home and found many items related to the investigation of the case.
He accepted seven charges relating to the attack and pleaded guilty to three other charges of deception and sexual assault against another 11-year-old girl between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim was walking along a small road when she turned around and saw him suddenly jumping out of the bushes, holding a large tree branch and a knife in her hand.
The man was dressed in a fancy dress of leaves.
Although the girl repeatedly begged the man to hold her hand, the man still held her neck by hand and dragged her hard into the bushes.
The man said to the girl, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He held the knife in his right hand, tied the girl's hands and legs with a nylon belt, and tied her to the tree, and assaulted her for nearly an hour. After he let the girl go, the girl ran to school crying.
The man arrived at the work unit at about 9:30 a.m. Before that, he was unable to reply to several messages and telephone calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were covered with dirt, grass, and leaves and skin, and he claimed to have suffered a road-rage accident when he drove into a bush with another driver and rolled over the embankment.
The man's sentencing hearing will continue on Tuesday.
California police fail to file federal charges after shooting blacks
On Thursday, federal authorities refused to file civil rights lawsuits against the unarmed black man shot by the Sacramento police. The shooting sparked a number of protests and pushed for changes to state laws limiting the use of lethal force by law enforcement agencies.
The Office of the United States Attorney-General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have said that a federal review of the 2018 shooting of 22-year-old Stephen Clark shows that there is "not enough evidence" to prosecute two police officers, Terence Merchant and Gerald Rownet, who will return to police duties.
In March, California's Attorney General's Office refused to prosecute the two policemen after completing an investigation that lasted nearly a year. Attorney General Javier Besela said evidence suggested that the two policemen had reason to believe that their lives had been threatened because the man was approaching them and allegedly holding a gun. The investigation found that he was carrying a cell phone.
On Thursday, the Sacramento Police also issued a statement saying its internal investigation did not find any violations of police regulations or training requirements by the two policemen.
"Despite the fact that the accident, or the incidents that led to it, did not result in the police finding any violations of the police regulations, we are still determined to implement a new strategy to prevent such tragedies from occurring again," said Daniel Hahn, director of the Sacramento Police Department, in a statement.
Clark's older brother, Stephen Clark, posted on his Facebook page Thursday that he was meeting with federal and local authorities at the time.
Authorities say the police believed Clark was holding a handgun when he approached the police and had run to his grandmother's backyard before he escaped the police chase. The police chased Clark the night after receiving reports of allegedly smashing car glass and sliding glass doors at an elderly neighbour's house.
When Clark approached the two policemen, the police fired seven shots at him.
Federal investigators examined relevant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, on-site video and audio recordings, police records, police reports and autopsy reports, to determine whether the police were deliberately using force beyond objective and reasonable limits.
Last month legislators introduced an amendment to the oldest U.S. law regulating the use of lethal force by the police, which will become the strictest standard for the use of force in the United States after all police are trained.
California's old standards make it very difficult to prosecute a policeman who shoots, and more difficult to convict, based on the principle of “reasonable fear,” that is, they can use lethal force if the prosecutor or the examiner thinks the police have reason to worry about their own safety.
The new law, which entered into force on 1 January, requires the police to use lethal force only at "necessary moments" in response to a lethal threat to the police or their surroundings.
Pope Francis warns tech executives to use artificial intelligence for public good
Pope Francis warned tech executives, diplomats, and financiers on Friday that creating artificial intelligence and other forms of digital development competitions would increase the risk of social inequality unless there was a moral assessment of public interest.
Francis made a speech at a conference in the Vatican attended by government envoys, representatives of Facebook and Google, philosophers, physicists and ethicists, and a small number of scholars and Catholic bishops attended a conference on the "public interests of the digital age".
The Vatican hopes to take a seat in the debate about the future of artificial intelligence and its dangers, and the three-day meeting is the latest testimony to that idea.
The debate included technological advances during the war, the growing dependence of future work on machines, case studies of the New Zealand massacre at Christchurch, and the decisions taken by social media companies after the video of the massacre was broadcast.
In his speech to the General Assembly, he praised the potential of technological progress and pointed out that machines in the early industrial revolution kept workers away from danger and from monotonous work, but he also warned that increasing dependence on robots for profit could deprive people of their dignity.
"If technological progress is the cause of growing inequality," he reminded, "it will not be called real progress."If so-called technological progress becomes an enemy of public interest, the whole society will revert to a barbaric era ruled by the strongest law."
The conference organizers said they hoped to use the professional knowledge of the participants to find suitable advisors for the Catholic Church on high-tech issues in the future.
The House voted on Friday to prevent US President Donald Trump from issuing a "state of emergency" statement, which Trump wants to use to fund his proposal to build a border wall.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution to end Trump’s actions by a margin of 236 to 174, and sent it to the president. Eleven Republicans and one Independent expressed support for the resolution. As 11 Republicans joined the Democratic process, the Senate passed the measure by 54 to 41.
Trump is likely to veto the resolution, his sixth time as president to block Congressional legislation, as he rejected a measure to end the state of emergency in March.
Both houses of Congress seem to have failed to reach the two-thirds majority required to overturn the veto.
In February, Trump declared a nationwide state of emergency, failing to obtain the funds needed from the Mexican government and Congress to build the southern border walls he wanted.The Trump administration plans to allocate $36 billion from military construction funds to border projects.
Democrats have accused Trump not only of circumventing Congress’s “package power” but also of using key defense funds to create unnecessary obstacles, and a minority of Republicans in the House and Senate have voiced concerns that Trump’s statement will lead to future “oversight.”
Some Senate Republicans who are due to run next year are under tremendous political pressure in the state emergency vote.
Google launches its 21st anniversary graffiti: a story you don't know
Google today celebrates its birthday with a doodle. The doodle is a 90s-style computer photo with a Google search page and a date stamp of September 27, 1998, surrounded by five Google colored paper scraps. The results page displays a smaller doodle, the Google logo designed as a 21-shaped candle. The search giant was founded 21 years ago by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students at Stanford University in California. However, September 27 is not Google's real birthday.
If you think the date of the company's founding is the company's birthday, then Google was born on September 4, 1998, yet the company never celebrated its own birthday on that day, at least not in the form of a doodle. Until 2005, Google celebrated its birthday on September 7 with doodles, then changed to September 27.
Initially, the search engine was known as the "network crawler" and later renamed "Google".
“We’re going to name our system Google because it’s the common spelling of Google (or 10100), which goes against our goal of creating a large-scale search engine,” said Sergei Brin and Lawrence Peach in a 1998 paper on a prototype for launching a large-scale search engine.
The company was founded thanks to Andy Bertelsheim, co-founder of the Solar Computer System, who invested $10,000; in June 1999, the company raised $250,000 from Red Cedar Capital and Ke Peng Huaxin. Google moved to Shan景 Office in the same year and is still there. In 2001, the company's technology was patented.
Google, a subsidiary of the company, has grown from a web search engine to a giant corporate group owned by letters. Today, it operates in more than 100 languages worldwide and answers tens of billions of search queries each year.
"Unremitting search for better answers is still at the heart of everything we do," Google said on its "Our Story" page. "Nowadays, Google has over 60,000 employees in 50 different countries, from oil pipes, Android to treasures, and of course Google Search, which has developed hundreds of products for billions of people around the world.
Trump denies Iran's claims of falling oil prices after US proposal to lift sanctions
On 10 January 2019, President Hassan Rouhani delivered a speech at a ceremony in Tehran, Iran.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani claimed on Friday that the US proposal to lift all sanctions on Iran in exchange for negotiations had led to a fall in oil prices, which President Donald Trump and the US State Department later denied, leading to a downward spiral in oil prices.
West Texas crude oil futures recently fell to $55.91, down 0.9% from $54.79 previously. Brent crude oil futures fell to $61.89, down 1.4 per cent.
"The German prime minister, British prime minister and French president are all in New York, and they insist on holding the meeting," Reuters quoted him as saying on his official website. "The United States has said it will lift the sanctions, which remain to be discussed, but they (the United States) have made it clear to lift all the sanctions.
Trump later responded to Iran: "Of course not!" He said that Iran hoped he would lift the sanctions so that the meeting could take place.
According to Bloomberg News, the U.S. State Department called the report "unfounded" and added that the U.S. was determined to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero.
On September 14, a series of drones attacked Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, forcing the country to cut oil production by half, after which Rouhani commented. The United States and some European countries, as well as Saudi Arabia, blamed Iran for the attack. Tehran denied any role in the incident, and the Trump administration announced plans to deploy U.S. troops to the region.
The U.S. State Department did not respond immediately to the request for comment by the U.S. Consumer News and Business Channel.
John Kildaf, a revival capitalist, said: "For a long time, people may not have been in favour of a calming of the tensions in the U.S., which would immediately bring a large amount of oil back to the market.
"It's not just Iran's production and exports, it's millions of barrels of oil in floating storage facilities and millions of barrels of oil waiting for customs clearance in China's ports," Kirdaf said.
Trump last year ordered the United States to withdraw from a nuclear deal signed by Iran, the United States, and five other countries, under which countries would lift sanctions against Iran in exchange for their commitments to halt their nuclear projects.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been the target of US sanctions for decades, with Washington accusing it of attacking oil tankers in the Gulf of Hormuz recently, Tehran denying it, and Iran shooting down a U.S. military drone, and announcing plans to execute 17 suspected US spies.
Afghan security forces strengthened in response to presidential elections
Afghanistan has launched large-scale security operations throughout the country in preparation for the country's presidential election on Saturday.
The Government will deploy about 100,000 security personnel to guard the polling stations in response to the threat posed by the Taliban.
Fearing retaliation, many voters (especially those in rural areas) would stay at home, while others said the system of voting elections was prepared for those in power and not for the poor.
Royal News: How Princess Beatrice "reacted angrily against family members who were hostile"
On Thursday, Duke and Duchess York announced that their granddaughter Princess Beatrice had been engaged to her boyfriend, 34-year-old property magnate Edward Mapley Moss, the ninth successor to the British throne, who will marry Mapley Moss next year.The couple said in a statement, "We are all excited to start this journey together.
"We have many similar interests and values, and we know that this will be of great benefit to us in the years to come, full of love and happiness.
Princess Beatrice's parents Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson also expressed their excitement.
"I know how my mother feels, so I've had tears of joy. I'm proud of the shocking news," Duchess York wrote on Twitter
Andrew and I are the luckiest people, because we have two great son-in-laws.
This royal wedding will be an opportunity for the whole royal family to reunite again, in the hope that it will completely restore the relationship between Fiji and the Duke of Edinburgh.
Since Sara became involved in one of the biggest scandals in the history of the royal family, her relationship with other members has become extremely difficult.
In 1992, five months after the announcement of her breakup with Prince Andrew, a photograph of her and her "financial adviser" at a holiday home in St. Tropez was made public.
The photographs featured the kiss, sucking of the Duchess' toes and bow, of the Texas millionaire John Bryan, who was said to have been the most reactionary to the Duchess's daughter-in-law's scandals.
However, it was reported that he was "stunned" at the behaviour of Duchess York, and Princess Beatrice had claimed that her mother had been the victim of "a vile act that made her feel unwelcome".

A spokeswoman for the Duchess was reportedly unable to comment, but a friend of Fiji said, "It is no longer a secret that the daughters of Sara are very frustrated with the way the royal family treats their mothers.
"Some of the bills she has received are very generous.
"They have always blamed their father for letting this happen, and especially Beatrice has been pleading to Prince Andrew not to treat their mother as an exiled person.
In October last year, at the wedding of Princess Eugene and Jack Brooksbank, Philip and Sarah were filmed together for the first time in 26 years.
Second wave of strikes in Oregon
State University staff complained that the main focus was on low wages and a lack of dignity in the workplace. The pay gap was staggering, with about half of these staff earning less than $40,000 a year (some hundreds earning less than $25,000 a year). Meanwhile, the average annual salary of university presidents was $50,000, while the salary of four university sports coaches was slightly lower, totalling $100,000. Although the salary of school administrators was six, overall administrative expenditures were still rising and one-sixth of the classified staff were eligible for food vouchers.
As another IT worker at Portland State University, Alexander Sekula, said, "I want to take part in the strike because I think it is unfair that the wages paid to people do not guarantee their lives in the city they serve," and, more directly, Portland State Library staffer Theresa Stackerberg said, "I want to take part in the strike because I've been working here for 24 years, and I need a raise and I want to make a living.
With inflation rising and Oregon's living costs skyrocketing, these workers are in trouble, with management barely sympathetic. The contract negotiations that began in February were interrupted in mid-August, when bosses came up with some particularly excessive proposals - a slight increase in living costs, a rejection of the university's long-term staffing requirements, and an increase in staff meals - which staff felt was not respectful or even cruel.
For decades, education workers have been attacked, and we have finally stood up to fight back. When corporate executives see their relatively jealous pay rising at a rate higher than inflation, class discrimination and pressure on the middle class can be faced peacefully. But when the same happens in education, workers will not continue to tolerate.
The staff at Oregon State University are not the only ones to take action. Oregon is now a battleground filled with fireworks, and the seams are burning hot and bright. The grocery workers at Fred Mayer's supermarket chain are actively campaigning against employers, although there are no formal strike plans, but tensions are escalating; their union, the local 555 branch of the Confederation of Food and Commercial Workers, has been demanding joint resistance and is presenting unfair labor practice reports against the chain.
In the healthcare sector, if the 4,500 service workers of the medical establishment in Kazakhstan who are members of the 49 local branches of the International Federation of Nurses do not reach an agreement before the current contract expires in October (just by temporarily avoiding it through a new interim agreement), the strike will be approved (with a 98 per cent approval rate).In other sectors of the industry, the Oregon Nurse Association, which represents more than 120 nurses in the hospital of Astoria, has reached a deadlock in negotiations on the contracts with the hospital management department, whose last contract expires in May, and the time is very tight.
"The labor movement in Oregon is moving very strongly, and it's moving very thoroughly, and it's part of the nation's wave of labor growth," he explained. "What we're seeing is economic instability, real wages falling, and the solution is collective action in the workplace.
The extent to which such collective action will take place this autumn is not yet clear, but it is certainly appropriate to return to the Northwest in 2019.We can only hope that the spirit of action will spread further to the Midwest agriculture, southern manufacturing, Texas oil fields, Alabama coal mines, northeastern construction, Silicon Valley tech giants, and any sector and industry in between.
Political Civilization: The establishment of a new award scheme to eliminate Westminster disagreements and reward polite politicians
The new award scheme is intended to honour polite politicians
After the parliamentary re-election, Westminster had a week of constant controversy.
In this controversial week, lawmakers faced threats and resentment from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others.
In response to disagreements, the "political civilization" award was unveiled last Friday, giving annual politicians a £3,000 prize for philanthropy.
Boris Johnson has been criticized for his rhetoric in the House of Commons
"Everyone agrees that British politics is facing a crisis of confidence and a crisis of civilisation," Lord Stuart said as he announced the award
"We are convinced that politics must respond, not to these trends, but to those trends.
These awards are a small attempt by a group of the public to draw the attention of the public - political or non-political - to politicians who defend their cause in a dignified and polite manner, and to politicians who can reach out and cooperate with people across differences that affect all of us."
The nominations will be announced in the sixth cycle and the award ceremony will take place in March next year.
Former Cabinet Minister Andrew Rudd, in an exclusive interview with the British Standard Evening News today, accused Johnson of using provocative words that "really incite violence".
Johnson said he "regrets" the threat against MPs.
Jesse Phillips was "frightened" by the death threat of "fear"
On Thursday, Labour MP Jesse Phillips, another critic of Johnson, said a man was arrested after trying to " kick" out the door of her constituency office, allegedly shouting that he was a "fascist."
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Joe Stevenson gave a speech to the police after threatening her young child.
Earl Cooper, daughter of Labour senior MP Ivette Cooper, posted a rapidly spread post on Twitter describing her concerns about her mother after Cox's murder, accusing Johnson of "instigating violence against MPs through speech."
As a matter of fact, the income gap in the United States is the highest in history
Last year, the income gap between the poor and the rich in the United States reached its highest level since the U.S. Census Bureau began its income statistics in 1967. Washington and New York are among the regions with the largest income gaps.
The United States may be the world’s richest country, but the situation is the same: the super-rich can continue to thrive in any way, and a poor household often depends on “to fund me” (a crowd-funded website) to pay for health care.Economic imbalances affect both wealth and income, and the latter is at historically high levels.
One way of measuring the income gap is the kinetic coefficient. The smallest kinetic coefficient is 0, which represents an absolute average, and the largest one is 1, which represents an assumption that a family has all the national income. For the past 50 years, the Census Bureau has been tracking this index. The kinetic coefficient in the U.S. was 0.397 in 1967, but it has risen to a peak of 0.485 in 2018.
There are also other countries in the world whose income gaps are more severe, including some of the most powerful economies. For example, the World Bank estimates that South Africa has a GNI of 0.63 in 2014 and Brazil a GNI of 0.53 in 2017. All EU countries have a GNI of less than 0.4.
New figures show that the regions with the biggest income gaps are often wealthy areas, including Washington, New York, and Connecticut, and, of course, poorer areas such as Puerto Rico and Louisiana, where economic equality is highest in Utah, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
The Census Bureau's data also showed that the average household income growth stalled to more than $62,000, the highest level ever measured by a US community survey, but growth from 2017 to 2018 was only 0.8 percent, a sharp decline from the previous three years, a figure that has barely grown if inflation is considered.
The new statistics are likely to pave the way for a Democratic candidate to run in next year's presidential race, which normally supports higher taxes on super-rich people and corporations.
This may also undermine the underlying idea behind the current government’s corporate tax preferences, approved by Congress in 2017, aimed at persuading multinationals to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, while shifting incomes to the middle and poor.In fact, these policies seem to bring only additional incomes to executives, while the vast majority of Americans miss out on the benefits of economic growth and record low unemployment.
A North Carolina man drew five times in the same lottery draw
A North Carolina man drew five times in the same lottery draw, including the first prize of $163,634.
Garan Lancaster of Peckville told North Carolina Educational Lottery officials that while he was staying at the Wesham Brothers Company in Peckville, he bought five cash lottery tickets with his own five sets of numbers for five draws on Monday night.
"My wife wrote the number for me at the draw," said Lancaster, "and when my wife handed me the paper, and I checked the lottery, I couldn't believe it. One line matched five numbers and the other line matched four numbers. I cried out, 'I won! I won! I won the lottery!'
Lancaster was awarded a prize of $163,634 for a line of five numbers matching the number of the middle prize, while the remaining line of four numbers matching the number of each middle prize was awarded a prize of $250.
The winner says he intends to use the money to pay his bills and repair some houses.
Tristan Thompson, a former ex-boyfriend of Cole Kardashian, left another very provocative comment on the wall of her picture, which was previously rumored to have been linked to her.
Tristan Thompson, a former ex-boyfriend of Cole Kardashian, left another very provocative comment on her wall photos, which had previously been rumored to be linked to her.
Earlier this year, the 35-year-old star completely abandoned the American National Basketball Association player because Thompson was accused of stealing from his family friend, Jordan Woods. Prior to that, when Cole was nine months pregnant with their daughter, Drew, Tristan had been out of line.
It was found that Tristan left another enthusiastic applause on the wall page of Cole's photograph
However, the 28-year-old Tristan refused to give up easily - leaving an embarrassing overstatement on his ex-girlfriend's latest selfie.
In this blurry photo, Cole, standing in front of Jean Valjean's rising sun, wrote in her mother's name: "May you have the courage to explore every dream of yours."
In his public comment, Ritterstein wrote, "The sun shines brilliantly on your beautiful [diamond expression symbol]."
Fans were outraged by the comment, and some responded, "Yes, that diamond you dropped."
When Cole was nine months pregnant, Tristan betrayed her
Another fan warned: "Get out of the photo wall.
The third person wrote, "Cole, don't be upset."
Just a few days ago, Tristan wrote, "Perfect," next to a heart-shaped face, below one of Cole's other reality shows, was a photo of her modeling for Gail's jeans.
Earlier this month, the Sun revealed that Tristan, on Derek's advice, had spent £40,000 to buy a Porsche for Cole in order to make a deal with him.
Earlier this year, he was also accused of stealing from a friend of the Cadiz family, Jody Woods
After his singer-songwriter urged a "big move", Tristan decided to choose this delightful gift, which is said to be Porsche 911.
Eventually, his friends told him that Tristan had won Cole's invitation and was able to attend a "Taco" dinner at her home on Tuesday -- a step closer to reuniting with Cassia and their 17-month-old daughter, Troy.
"Tristan and Drake are good friends, and when he was planning to go back to Cadiz, he was always asking for Drake's advice," one source said.
Tristan's disobedience hurt Cole's heart
"Drek told him that if he wanted to go back to Cole, he had to do his best.
"Although it may not sound reasonable to exchange a casual dinner with a trendy super racer.
But after Tristan did these things, Cole did not immediately lay the red carpet for him.
The couple are the parents of Drew, who is 17 months old
In the lead-up to the new season's 16th episode of the reality TV series Along with the Cassian Family, Cole Cassian was tearful and weeping over the departure of her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson
The Sun reported last month that Tristan had vowed to invite Cole on a romantic trip to Greece: "I'll bring my family back.
Although Cole was upset about the constant departure of Tristan from their relationship, he invited Tristan to their daughter Troy's first birthday party earlier this year.
However, the star's family reality show, Accompanying the Cassian Family, later revealed that the incident ended with Cole's tearful acceptance of Tristan's disobedience.
Children's hospital freezer fails, 56 children with cancer damaged stem cells
The Los Angeles Children's Hospital's fridge failed, resulting in the destruction of 56 children's blood stem cells, which were collected and stored for future use when each patient began cancer therapy.
"We apologize for the pain or confusion caused to the patients and their families. If you do not receive a letter or call from our team that your children will not be affected," the hospital said in a statement.
All patients have undergone basic therapy, with the exception of one, who does need to retrieve stem cells, says Chief Medical Officer James Stan.
In early September, a letter to the patient's family informing them of the loss of stem cells was unexpectedly sent to the children, not to the parents. The hospital also apologized to the parents and said it would monitor the transmission.
The hospital says long-term storage of stem cell damage does not harm any child's health. It has also provided assistance to families hoping to retrieve them, but the process may be more difficult.
A 13-year-old boy, Sean Anderson Coroner, undergoes stem cell therapy after being diagnosed with a 4-phase neuromuscular tumor (a cancer that is often found in the kidney gland).The boy doesn't get out of the machine all day long, the machine collects stem cells from his blood and then re-injects the blood back into the body.
"I would try to get to sleep, but my body would start shaking, and then I would get crazy and start crying," Coroner told ABC-7.
In November this year, Coroner will be three years without a recurrence of cancer, but his mother, Elizabeth Anderson, said she feared that if his cancer recurred, she might not be able to collect more stem cells from his blood.
Stan says he recommends re-acquiring stem cells only if the patient has a recurrence of disease and needs them.
"We think it's almost unlikely," he said, "so we won't ask anyone to do it in advance.
The hospital has replaced the fridge, and the sensor monitoring and alarm system has been upgraded.
"Obviously, it's a huge expense for us," Stan said. "We'll contact each family directly to ensure that all their questions are answered.
Prince Harry inherited Princess Diana's wandering route through Angolan territory
This was the sixth day the Duke of Saxe had visited Africa with his wives Megen and Archie, but on Friday morning Prince Harry returned to Angola alone with the intention of inheriting the will of his mother, Queen Diana.
Harry, wearing the bright blue protective backpack provided by the HALO Trust, successfully inherited her mother's will. Twenty-two years ago, Princess Diana left her footprints on a similar road across an area of Angola buried in deadly mines that were left behind during the civil war, one of the most iconic images of her brief life.
On 15 January 1997, Princess Diana of Wales, wearing a protective backpack and a mask, visited a minefield cleared by the Rotary Foundation in the province of Vancouver, Angola.
Diana had been striving to eradicate such weapons of war, but had not been able to do so during the world, when she died just a few months before the International Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction in December 1997.
Twenty years later, the world is still unable to escape the threat of mines. Prince Harry has detonated a newly discovered mine, a loud and clear response to his mother's wishes.
"Through mine clearance, we can help local communities achieve peace, and peace brings opportunities," said Prince Harry.
Prince Harry detonated the latest detected mine in Angola.
Thomas Cook Pension Trustee Planned Expenditure Savings Agreement
Thomas Cook's pension fund has begun negotiations on an agreement with professional insurance companies to save the bankrupt travel group's retirement benefits.
Sky News was informed that Trusteeship Chairman Steve Straw was negotiating a buy-out agreement with several companies that would exempt the majority of the 1.4 million members of the Thomas Cook Pension Plan from a significant reduction in pension payments.
Any deal with an insurance company may involve spending cuts that are much smaller than the 10% spending cuts triggered by transferring pension plans to the pension protection fund’s lifeboat.
The discussion is still at a very preliminary stage – even if successful – until agreement is reached after the Pension Protection Fund has evaluated the Thomas Cook program.
Thomas Cook's bosses are facing an investigation into why the group went bankrupt
The survey could last two years, and if the Thomas Cook program does introduce pension protection funds, spending on about 10,000 pension recipients will be reduced by 10% in the future.
According to reports, several pension risk transfer experts, as well as at least one new "super fund" consolidation company, are negotiating an agreement with Thomas Cook's trustees.
Four days after the longest-running travel company in the UK quit, the news that trustees were working to ensure members' welfare triggered an international repatriation plan that left thousands of people unemployed.
Thomas Cook's profound bankruptcy triggered a fierce accusation game in which board members, government ministers, and auditors all needed to explain their respective actions in the months before the group went bankrupt.
According to the latest data, Thomas Cook's four pension plans are well funded and have a surplus of £100 million on the basis of the pension protection fund.
In total, they hold assets worth about £15 billion,
However, Sky News revealed last month that the rescue deal proposed by Thomas Cook, which the trustee requested, added more favourable terms, complicated the deal's conclusion.
Thomas Cook's bankruptcy ended his 178-year debt-recovery deal, prompting bankruptcy service agencies, accounting regulators, and an influential parliamentary committee to investigate him.
The ministers have set up a task force to deal with the crisis, which has weakened the earnings of creditors after the group goes bankrupt.
To date, fewer than half of Thomas Cook's overseas UK customers have returned home.
Hours before his bankruptcy, Thomas Cook made a final plea to his lender, demanding a reduction of £200 million in financing demand.
What's wrong with Thomas Cook?
Negotiations ended late Sunday, but no agreement was reached, and Thomas Cook was forced to seek more than £1 billion in new financing, the last of its mad fights, after a six-month loss of £15 billion and deteriorating trading conditions.
Thomas Cook was created in 1841 by a 32-year-old furniture builder, a former Baptist missionary, who introduced a one-day train ride from Leicester to Frankfurt, with a prescription for each person.
From then onwards, Thomas Cook became one of the world's largest holiday companies and celebrated its 175th anniversary three years ago.
"Some bankruptcies, such as that of Thomas Cook, were the reason for the creation of the pension fund," said a spokesman for the pension fund.
"We are providing financial security for the future of pension plan members, and they should be reassured that we will protect them," he said.
A spokesman for Thomas Cook's pension trust declined to comment on Friday.
The picture shows a newborn rhino rubbing its mother's nose and exploring a new home.
The baby, named Stella, was born earlier this month at the Cotswold Wildlife Sanctuary in Oxfordshire and was the first female baby born to Monty and Ruby.
The baby is very healthy and well cared for, and as you can see from the photograph, it has a wonderful environment around it and sleeps with her mother on a straw bed.
In 2009, Ruby's mother and another female named Nancy joined the Wildlife Park, hoping to become the first small rhinoceros in the park to be born to Montey.
In 2013, Nanshi gave birth to a female baby named Astrid, the third female to be born in the park's 49-year history.
"We have been very successful in breeding the existing rhino populations," said James Craig, head of the Cotswold Wildlife Park.
"Stra is the sixth child of Nancy and Ruby, and our cow Montey has proven to be an excellent father.
"He is the perfect combination of a ruling bull and a careful parent.
"It is particularly gratifying that Robbie gave birth to a calf, which is crucial to the development of the breeding program, and that Stella will eventually be transferred to another group, hoping that she will also be a successful mother herself.
Ruby had previously given birth to two male cubs, Ian in 2015 and Allen in 2017.Elan is still in the park, while Ian is in the Turin Zoo in Italy
When Allen was only a week old, he weighed about 11 pounds.
The breeding is considered to be extremely rare. Females reproduce only once every two and a half to five years, so the window of opportunity for successful reproduction is limited.
According to the park, female rhinos usually have a period of 16 to 18 months to give birth to a small rhino.
It is considered one of the longest periods of pregnancy in terrestrial mammals, just 22 months after the elephant.
A newborn rhino can stand within an hour of birth. After birth, the young rhino will immediately try to suck, although in the first few days its legs may be a little shaky.
It will suck up about a year's milk under the eyes of its mother.
Their relationship is very intimate, and the young rhinoceros will stay with their mothers for at least two years under their protection. The females will be very active in protecting their offspring, and if challenged, they will intimidate their opponents.
Alex Mina Xian, a non-voluntary bachelor, told Toronto police he was a member of the 4chan website
The man in the picture allegedly killed 10 pedestrians in Toronto and told police he was a member of an online sex-disoriented men's organization.
Alex Mina Xian, 26, said he was a member of the 4chan website's non-voluntary singles forum.
Following the attack on 23 April 2018, he now faces 10 murder charges and 16 unsuccessful murder charges in Canada.
When asked about the dead, he told the police, "I think I have accomplished my mission.
After the incident, people's attention was drawn to the world of online loneliness, anger and anti-feminism.
Minar Xian said he had contacted a killer in California who was angry at the woman who refused him.
He was charged with driving a rented bread truck into crowds in a busy community in northern Toronto. Eight women and two men were killed in the crash, aged 22 to 94.
Miner Xian has not yet filed an appeal. His trial began in February, but his ban on publishing interviews with the police has been lifted today. The police interviewed him hours after the attack.
Miner Xian said he had never given his girlfriends, and was a man, and admitted that he used trucks as weapons, and said he wanted to launch more attacks.
"Some other people I know online have the same feelings," he said, adding that they are "too timid to take action to vent their anger."
Mina Xian calls herself "incel," the abbreviation for "non-voluntary singles."The non-voluntary singles movement is an online subculture group associated with the deadly attacks in Toronto and the attacks in California and Florida, which promote the idea of aversion to women, that men have the right to have sex with women.
Sociologists and other scholars studying the group believe that "non-voluntary loneliness" has gradually become a popular term that angered some men who were angry at the rejection of women and tended to generate ideas of violent retaliation.
In online forums, amateurs sometimes use "chard" and "steady" as derisive slang, referring to men and women who are more active in sexual life, respectively.
Minar Xian said he discussed his sexual disillusionment on 4chan, a notorious site where extremists publish their views.
The U.S. Senate fears a rerun of the shooting and bans U.S. viewers from dressing up as Joe
The largest independent theater in the U.S. has banned costumed spectators from watching the well-received Ugly, which tells the story of the super-antipopulist world of Batman.Although theaters have banned spectators from wearing masks or painting faces, security concerns remain.
Most US theaters have banned the wearing of masks, painted faces, or toy weapons because of a major shooting in Colorado in 2012, when another Batman film, The Rise of the Dark Knight, was screened, in which gunmen wearing clown costumes fired at the audience and threw tear gas, killing 12 people and injuring 70.
However, the landmark theaters announced that they would not allow costumed viewers to watch the limited-length film The Clown.
"I want the audience to be more relaxed when they watch movies," Ted Mondov, chairman and chief executive of Landmark Cinemas, told Hollywood reporters.
Headquartered in Los Angeles, the company has 52 cinemas in 27 regions of the country and is the largest professional cinema chain in the United States.
Meanwhile, the largest chain of cinemas in the United States, the Kansas-based American multi-storey theater, reaffirmed that the theaters were prohibited from "painting masks, painting faces or any body covering the faces", but welcomed viewers wearing costumes.
Prohibition of masks and fake guns is more for practical safety reasons, but as the clown's release approaches, fears are raised that it will trigger a shooting simulation.The Los Angeles Police Department says police will be "strictly watchful" around the theaters on the day of its premiere, while the second-largest chain of movie theaters in the United States, The Empire, says it is implementing security measures developed in "co-operation with NATO."
The U.S. Army even warned soldiers to watch out for "non-voluntary solitary confidants", usually men who were dissatisfied with the lack of a date and who worshiped the clown and might imitate his cruelty.
The clown, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Jake Phoenix, was scheduled to land in the U.S. Senate on October 4, and was expected to hit a new box office record.The film's protagonist is a descendant of an isolated and psychotic man who became a murderer-killer, green-haired, pale-faced, and Batman's enemy.
Ugly is a psychological thriller adapted from a comic book of the same name. Some critics worry that the film may have negative repercussions, as the protagonist is sympathetic and anti-Semitic and the violence is too realistic. However, the film's creative team says the audience is an adult who can tell the truth.
Midway Broadcasting Corporation announced today that its chairwoman, Ms. Mellody Spencer Cooper, will publish a new book that is expected to help women entrepreneurs and executives develop their careers. The Women's Friendship Successful Dealing Guide shares many of her views and insights, including how women can speak on the negotiating table to achieve equality and how to use the women's version of the Alumni Relations Network to advance their careers.
The book uses anecdotes and anecdotes to illustrate controversial topics, including the #I Am movement and the failure of Hillary Clinton's campaign and its impact on the empowerment of American women.
In 2017, Spencer Cooper delivered a breakthrough speech at the Chicago National Association of Women Entrepreneurs, a self-published book that was the culmination of the speech.The Women's Friendship Guide to Successful Dealing is a language style that is so catchy that every woman's friend can find a connection to herself in the book.
"The Women's Friendship Success Trading Guide is very interesting and helpful," says businesswoman Christie Hayfner, daughter of Hugh Hayfner, the founder of the company. "Mellody combines personal anecdotes, success stories, setbacks and real-life experiences. Everyone can benefit from her story from how to express their ideas at a meeting to when to make friends," she says.
As chairwoman of Midway Broadcasting, she acquired control of the company in 1999 and became one of the leading women broadcasters in the United States. Midway Broadcasting is a leading female family-based media company with multiple broadcasting and interactive platforms.
T. Sean Taylor, co-author of the book, is a journalist, writer, and founder of Tree Top Consulting, a full-service media consulting company.
Romania spends billions on Black Sea military bases
Romania will spend €25 billion on modernisation of the Black Sea military base to counter Russia's growing influence in the region, the Times quoted Focus as saying. Documents released by local news websites show that the Mikhail Kogrignyhanov Air Force Base, located about 200 km east of Bucharest, will remain in line with NATO standards, with a maximum capacity of 10,000 NATO F-35 fighters, and plans to build a military mini-city with kindergartens, sports clubs and hospitals.
The base has become the center of NATO’s increased activity in the Black Sea, which has become a key area of tension between Russia and the West. After Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin began using the deep-sea base in Sevastopol to carry out naval missions in Syria to increase its naval presence in the Black Sea. Russia also obstructed transportation in the region, capturing three Ukrainian ships in the Red Sea last year.
Romania and Bulgaria are on the Black Sea coast, former allies of the Soviet Union, and have joined NATO and the EU since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In response to Russia's actions, they asked NATO to strengthen its presence in the region. In February, 500 US troops arrived at Romania's air base. The British Air Force's European Typhoon Fighter Squadron has been stationed and deployed. Since April last year, these aircraft have repeatedly intercepted Russian fighters. Georgia, on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, is also concerned about Russia's belligerent ambitions. It is not a member of NATO, but participates in NATO military exercises. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said during a visit to Abyei in March that NATO is "preparing" for Georgia. Ukraine has also participated in NATO exercises in the region,
The New Berlin Wall again engulfs Ukraine
This cleared the way for Giuliani to put pressure on Ukraine’s Attorney General Yuri Luzenko (later dismissed), to investigate Joe Biden and his son, and to help with Trump’s re-election.
But it remains unclear how the Trump administration will help him reverse his declining position before the Ukrainian presidential elections in March and April, both of which were hit hard by Zerenski, who soon became the Trump team’s new target for battling Biden.
Despite the Democrats’ hope that Trump will be impeached for his dealings with Ukraine, the president and his allies have countered with a self-styled Ukrainian scandal, reaffirming an uncovered claim that Ukraine had collaborated with Clinton’s campaign team to reduce Trump’s chances of running in 2016, and claiming that, under virtually no evidence, Biden had used his vice-presidential post to prevent Ukraine from investigating his son.
Over the years, the Ukrainian people have become twice as tired of watching their own leaders continually take power and privileges in exchange for personal economic or political interests; today, most Ukrainians are dismissive of what may be the most serious scandal against the White House’s Trump administration since the 1974 Watergate overthrow of President Richard Nixon.
Ukraine has become the centerpiece of Washington, a feeling that has generated a great deal of confusion in Ukraine, with a sense of pride that, after hundreds of years under the shadow of its northern strong neighbour, Russia, Ukraine is no longer seen as a dead pool of water, but as an unbelievably turning point in the fate of the world’s most powerful nation.
This week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, under Bolshevik, tweeted a harsh message saying the prospects were "not good" as "the country that led to the impeachment of the U.S. president," but added, "Now everyone understands our endurance.
The brother of Pakistan's Red Cardinal Baluch was sentenced to life imprisonment for honor killings
Carl Barlow, known for his social media photos, was arrested in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistan's social media star Kandir Baloch was found guilty last Friday of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in the country's most notorious honor killings.
Barokh is known for her funny self-portraits, which are nothing by Western standards, but Pakistan, which is extremely anti-feminist and considered provocative, was arrested and executed in July 2016.
Her brother Mohammed Vasim was arrested, and a few days later, at a press conference, he said he did not regret everything he had done to himself, admitting "of course" that he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "intolerable".
His lawyer, Saad Mahmoud, told AFP that the court in the eastern city of Multan had convicted his client and sentenced him to life imprisonment, a remarkable sentence.
"If the circumstances permit, he will be acquitted by the High Court," he said.
Earlier, Barlow's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that she had hoped her son would be released without charge.
"He's innocent. The killer is my daughter, the killer is my son," she said.
The murder of Barokh has become international headline news and once again calls for action to combat the spread of the so-called "honour killers", in which a victim, usually a woman, is murdered for defiance of patriarchal social norms.
Women were burned, shot, injured, and mutilated for their free choice of husband or, in the case of Baroque, for crimes such as "shaming" their families by praising their gender.
Such murders are usually committed by relatives, who can seek forgiveness from the victim's relatives under Pakistani blood debt and reprisals law.
Three months after Barlow's murder, parliament passed new legislation that stipulated that those killed for the sake of honour would be sentenced to life imprisonment.
However, whether murder is defined as a crime of honour is a matter for the judge to decide, which means that, theoretically speaking, a murderer can claim to have different motives but still be granted an amnesty.
In the Baroque case, her parents initially insisted that they would not pardon their son.
But when they thought they would lose their son, they changed their minds and said they hoped he would be forgiven.
The international community's resentment of the murders prompted the Pakistani Government to take unprecedented steps to announce that the Government, together with its parents, would succeed the victims, but this forced the case to continue.
Some of Baroque's well-known behaviors included performing for Pakistan's cricket team, and wearing a falling scarlet dress on Valentine's Day.
Her actions provoked some criticism and threats, but many, including young people, believed that the Kim Kardashian character could be seen as a bold political act that empowered women and set a new stage for the country.
Honor killings are rooted in tribal social norms, which are still prevalent throughout South Asia and which specifically regulate the conduct of women, although men may also be victims.
Three Scottish students awarded Best Student in Europe
Three students from the University of Dundee in the United Kingdom were awarded the best graduates in the European region.
In the 2019 Global Undergraduate Awards, three students from Dundee University were recognized as best graduates in their respective fields, while five other students from the university were also recognized by the jury.
Scott Sheldrick graduated from the School of Molecular Genetics and won the European Award for Best Graduate in Life Sciences; Chester Conford graduated from the School of Psychiatric and Nursing Sciences and won the Award for Nursing, Obstetrics and Occupational Health Care; and Laura Nebus won the Award for Visual Arts.
Despite the three students entering the global finals, they were defeated in the final, which drew 3,500 students from around the world.
"To reach this stage, our students and graduates are facing a large number of students from top universities in the world," said Professor Blair Grabb, deputy head of education at Dundee University.
" Thousands of students around the world are being encouraged to compete for undergraduate awards, and the students at Dundee University are very representative of these winners, which reflects very well the quality of our students and the educational standards they have here.
"We warmly congratulate Scott, Chester and Laura on their extraordinary achievements and the other students from Dundee who have been highly commended.
Five other students from Dundee University were also recognized in the world's top undergraduate award, which recognizes their best academic performance and shares their achievements with a global audience.

The Queen's Palace, the oldest galaxy
A team of international astronomers, using the Subaru Telescope, the Keck Telescope and the Twin Constellations Telescope, have discovered 12 galaxies that existed about 130 billion years ago, the oldest known proton cluster to date. The largest of them is the Pythagoras discovered 10 years ago by the Subaru Telescope, named after the mythical queen of Japan. The discovery suggests that large-scale galaxies such as the proton cluster existed only 800 million years ago when the universe was formed, accounting for only 6% of its age today.
In the present universe, galaxies can contain hundreds of galaxies, but how these galaxies are formed remains a question in the astronomical field. To understand the formation of galaxies, astronomers look for possible origins in the ancient universe. The original galaxies were a dense system in the early universe composed of dozens of galaxies, and gradually formed a galaxy.
The team of astronomers is headed by Yu Tsunedao, a researcher at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan and a member of the Japan Academic Revival Association, who explains, "The protocluster is a rare and specially dense system of galaxies that is very difficult to find. To solve this problem, we used the wide field of view of the Subaru Telescope to map the sky in a large-scale map and to look for primitive clusters.
On a space map drawn by the Subaru Telescope, the team discovered a hypothetical cluster galaxy z66OD, which had a density 15 times that of normal galaxies of that time. Subsequent spectral observations by the Keck Observatory and the Northern Hemisphere Telescope confirmed that the 12 galaxies date back 130 billion years and are the oldest known cluster of galaxies.
Interestingly, one of the twelve galaxies in z66OD is the giant giant Plymouth, discovered by the Subaru Telescope in 2009, which contains a large amount of gas. "It is possible to find clusters near such massive objects as Plymouth. However, we are surprised that Plymouth is not at the center of the cluster, but on the edge of 500 million light-years away from the center. Ironically, the mythical queen Plymouth is also said to have lived a life isolated from the world. "It is not yet clear why Plymouth is not in the middle," he continued, "but these results will be important information for understanding the relationship between clusters and large-mass galaxies."
Nancy Pelosi becomes daughter of Christine Pelosi
A new book about U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is about to be published, and the author is a well-known daughter of hers, Christine Pelosi.
Tenma Books announced on Thursday that Nancy Pelosi's Road will be released on November 26.Cristine Pelosi's work will tell the story of how a mother of five became the first female speaker of the House of Representatives, and how she is currently leading the Democrats in the House under the Trump administration.According to Tenma Books, the new book will portray her mother's "professional and personal experiences."
Christine Pelosi is a Democratic strategy analyst and author of Campaign Training and Campaign Training 2.0. Pelosi's sister, Alexandra Pelosi, is a filmmaker and journalist who has made several documentaries about contemporary politics.
Warren donated the money for the lemonade to an abortion charity
When Senator Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts Democrat) bought drinks from two girls who run lemonade stands in August, she may not have realized that the $10 she bought would be donated to an anti-abortion charity.
"Our daughters think she's friendly," one of Trump's supporters, Dan Mitchell, the father of one of the girls, told the Washington Post. "She came over and told us we should vote for her.Our daughter told us she's a good person, but we don't agree with her politically...because she advocates women's right to choose abortion, and we say we should give her money to an anti-abortion cause."
On August 8, during a campaign bus trip to Iowa, Warren stopped in front of a lemon stall with two 11-year-olds, Serena Mitchell and Audrey Billings.
"When you come to Harlan, Iowa, in front of a lemon stand, take a sip of a cup and make a big structural change when life gives you lemons," Warren wrote on Twitter.
The two children are delighted to see a presidential candidate.After the photo was released, the girl named Michelle urged her parents to vote for the Massachusetts senator in 2020.However, the parents explained Warren's position on abortion.The girls and their parents decided to donate to the Life Education and Defense Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports anti-abortion legislation.
"My daughter told us she wanted us to vote for her," Michelle said. "We talked about abortion and said maybe we should give money to the anti-abortion campaign, and my daughter was completely in favour.
Why herpes virus and Zika virus need to be reclassified: the impact of biotechnology
Recent research suggests that the way people perceive virus structures needs to be re-adjusted, as their structures are actually more diverse than previously known. These findings may have a significant impact on their classification, our understanding of how they form, evolve, and infect hosts, and how to design vaccines to deal with them.
In the 1950s and 1960s, scientists began obtaining high-resolution images of viruses and discovered the detailed structure of the virus shell, which is an outer protective layer composed of multiple copies of the same protein used to protect the genetic material of the virus. Most virus shells are typically quasi-sphered, with a 20-faced symmetrical structure, like a 20-faced dice.
The shell is the protective layer of the virus, and when scientists discovered the structure of the shell, they suggested that the shell had different sizes and carried different amounts of genes, so that the virus could infect hosts in different ways.
Why is this important
When designing antiviral drugs, scientists can now consider their different structural shapes to improve their efficacy.
Two researchers at the Institute for Virus Information, Anthony Luke, a theoretical biological physicist at the University of San Diego, and Reton Dewarlock, a mathematical biologist at the University of York, came to the conclusion that many viruses have been largely misclassified in the last 60 years, including common viruses such as herpes simplex and Zika viruses.
Although we have obtained structural images from the low-temperature electron microscope, the researchers have not mathematically described the different virus structures.
"We've discovered six new forms of protein shells," Luke says. "So many viruses don't just use two well-known shell structures. There are now at least eight ways to design their shells."
The researchers used the generalization of the principle of quasi-equivalence to observe how proteins wrap around the shell of the Twenty-Face Body.
Their findings, which will be published in Nature on Friday, September 27, show that viruses belonging to the same structural spectrum, based on the proteins they make up, will adopt a consistent twenty-dimensional shell layout, providing a new method for studying virus evolution.
Application of biotechnology
Structural biologists can now use this information to reclassify the structure of viruses, which will help to reveal the molecular and evolutionary relationships between different viruses.
It will also provide guidance for the design of new molecular containers for use in nanotechnology and biotechnology, and will help scientists determine specific strategies for protein assembly in shells, which could provide a more systematic way to develop antiviral vaccines.
"We can use this finding to target the shell's assembly and stability to prevent viruses from forming or decomposing when infected with host cells, which may help to identify and identify antiviral targets for viruses that share the same twenty-dimensional layout," Luke said.
The new framework encompasses previously isolated viruses, provides new predictions of the shell structure of viruses, and determines common geometric patterns in the long evolution of viruses from humans to bacteria infecting all organisms.
The new blueprint also provides "a new perspective on the evolution of viruses, showing new ways in which larger and more complex viruses have evolved from simple viruses in evolutionary time scales," Dewalok said.
Application of Architecture
Geometry graphics can also be used for new building design and construction.
Inspired by the mapping of the top of the line designed by the renowned architect Buckminster Fuller, structural biologist Donald Casper and biophysicist Alan Krug introduced several geometric frames, and since the 1960s viruses have been classified according to the geometric frames of the virus shell. However, with the progressive advances in molecular imaging technology, more and more three-dimensional reconstructions of virus shells, including herpes and Zika viruses, have emerged from this classical geometric framework.
Luke explains, "This study will introduce a more general framework than the classic Caspa-Crugar structure, based on the preservation of the local tops formed by proteins interacting within the shell. This method has found six new types of twenty-dimensional shell layouts, while restoring two classical layouts from the Caspa-Crugar, which is based on a high-barrel and a measuring polyhedron.
Pastor convicted of raping boys in Wisconsin sentenced to 30 years in prison
A former pastor accused of raping boys in Wisconsin decades ago was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Thomas Ericson, 72, was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment on Thursday for two counts of sexual assault on a boy when he served as a priest in St. Peter's Catholic Church in the late 1970s and early 1980s, respectively.
Four men testified on Thursday to the impact of sexual assaults on their lives. One of the victims made his first public appearance.
At the court, Ericson apologized to the victim, saying he had begun to realize the impact of his actions on the victim. At least 11 men claimed to have been assaulted while Ericson was a minister.
Ericson was dismissed from the clergy in 1988.
Excessive intake of this ingredient may cause damage to the liver
Meat桂 is made from the inner skin of meat桂 tree, is a popular seasoning, is a seasoning of various foods, even itself has become a unique flavor.
It has some impressive health benefits, such as reducing the risk of life-threatening diseases (such as heart disease, cancer, and even diabetes), and is therefore welcome.
But let's not jump to the conclusion that too much can be harmful to the body. In this case, there are some side effects if you eat too much cinnamon. We should make sure you're safe.
It may increase the risk of cancer -- although cinnamon can help to reduce the risk of cancer, it is unfortunate it can also cause cancer to a great extent. According to animal studies, if you eat too much cinnamon, it may increase the risk of cancer.Scientists say cinnamon can damage our DNA and cause cancer in the long run.
Possible damage to the liver – Studies show that excessive consumption of caffeine can also lead to liver toxicity and injury, based on several studies of the effects of excessive consumption of caffeine on the human body.
Oral ulcers may be caused - excessive intake of cinnamon not only leads to fatal conditions, but also leads to oral ulcers. It is estimated that this is because cinnamon contains cinnamonaldehyde, a compound that can cause human allergic reactions after a large intake. However, only people who are allergic to cinnamonaldehyde can have oral ulcers.
It can cause respiratory problems - more of a common preventive measure, because cinnamon is delicate, easy to absorb, can cause cough and vomiting, and cinnamonaldehyde can also irritate the throat.
May lead to low blood sugar – For many people, cinnamon is good for the body because it reduces blood sugar significantly. This is very good, especially for people with high blood sugar. However, excessive intake causes too low blood sugar levels in the body, leading to a series of new health risks.
Tennessee abortion waits trial for judge's decision
In a 48-hour abortion wait trial in Tennessee, a federal judge must decide which expert to listen to.
In a four-day hearing that ended on Thursday in Nashville, Tennessee tried to prove that the law requiring women to visit clinics at least twice every 48 hours would give them time to reflect on their abortion decisions and would be beneficial to them. Prosecutors at five abortion clinics (of which there were seven in the state) argued that the law would not bring any benefits, but would create a huge burden.
Experts on both sides agree that some women who seek abortion are uncertain and some women who have aborted regret their decision.However, experts disagree on whether the proportion of women who seek abortion is much lower or whether the 48-hour waiting period in Tennessee has any impact on these women.
On Thursday, attorneys in Utah introduced a study on the 72-hour wait, which found that 8 percent of women who first went to the clinic said they no longer wanted to seek abortion.
Asked about the study, Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist at the University of California, San Francisco, agreed that some women change their minds about abortion or are uncertain at first, but pointed out that the study did not prove that the compulsory waiting period in Utah made women change their minds or that it was beneficial to women in other ways.
Beggs also confirmed that there is no evidence to date that abortion causes mental health problems in women, saying a national study comparing women who had successfully aborted before the due date to those who had been rejected from the clinic after the due date found no difference in the rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
In cross-examination, Biggs pointed out that the study did not track the psychological health outcomes of women who changed their minds after waiting, even though only three such women were found in the study.She refuted testimony earlier this week by Pricilla Coleman, a psychology professor at the State University of Bollington, Ohio, who said abortion was related to psychological health problems.
Coleman testified that she believed most of the scientific literature related to abortion supported political tendencies for abortion.
On Thursday, another Memphis-based gynecologist testified to the state that he had joined a highly controversial network that attempted to block abortion pharmaceuticals, and that through his work he had "contacted women who had changed their abortion intentions."
Tennessee's waiting period law has been in effect since mid-2015, and since then he has witnessed many women who want to block the efficacy of abortion drugs, including those who have changed their minds once again and ended up having a abortion, he testified. Even if there is a waiting period, the change of minds will still occur.
The clinic's directors had previously confirmed that waiting periods would create economic difficulties and pressure for women. The directors also said that two calls for consultations posed a coordination challenge for both patients and clinics, resulting in abortions being delayed far beyond the 48 hours prescribed by law, forcing some women to seek surgery for abortion, thereby increasing the risk of complications. A few women were forced to wait longer than they could.
According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, 14 states in the United States have enacted laws requiring women seeking abortion to visit abortion clinics twice, Tennessee being one of them.
In deciding whether Tennessee's waiting period violated the U.S. Constitution, District Judge Bernard Friedman had to determine whether it posed an excessive burden for women seeking abortion. Some subjective criteria led to the repeal of some waiting period laws, while others continued to be retained, depending on the state's reality.
On Thursday, Friedman said he would make a ruling as soon as possible after the two sides had completed their evidence.
Problems abound and the French refinery burns down
The plague continued to spread to large areas, and the French authorities and the Normandy residents were cleaning up the remains of the chemical plant fire.
A Luang lubrication plant burned down on Thursday without any casualties, but residents near the banks of the Seine expressed concern about the potential health risks and consequences.
Local administration officials said on Friday that after nearly 24 hours of efforts, the fire was extinguished on Thursday evening. Firefighters are still on the scene.
The French authorities have warned that a special smell will be emitted after the fire is extinguished, which could spread to neighbouring areas.
Interior Minister Christophe Castane said people with health problems should stay at home until Friday evening.
The cause of the fire is being investigated. The factory is listed as one of the highest-risk industrial sites in Europe.
2019 liquefied natural gas investments record and highest growth in China
Since the beginning of the year, investment in liquefied natural gas has reached $500 billion, the highest level in history, said International Energy Director Faith Beer at an industry congress.
“This year, investments in 2019 broke the highest record (final investment decision) of $500 billion for the first time,” Reuters quoted Bill as saying at a meeting of liquefied natural gas producers-consumers in Tokyo.
Undoubtedly, investment growth is driven by rising energy demand in Asia; China is expected to outperform Japan as the world’s largest importer of liquefied natural gas.
"The biggest growth comes from China, where one-third of the world's demand for liquefied natural gas will come from China alone in the next five years," said Bill, adding that five years from now, China will be the largest importer of the fuel.
Not surprisingly, most of the investments have been made in the US and Canada.
In a report released in December 2018 by the U.S. Department of Energy Information, US liquefied natural gas export capacity is expected to double to 89 billion cubic feet per day by the end of this year, making it the world's third-largest liquefied natural gas exporter, after Qatar and Australia. By 2030, US liquefied natural gas exports are expected to increase from 30 billion cubic feet per day in early 2019 to 170 billion cubic feet per day.
Canada currently has only one liquefied natural gas project - the Canadian liquefied natural gas project - but its final annual capacity could reach 28 million tons. The $3.1 billion project, led by Shell, involves minority stakeholders including Malaysian National Petroleum Corporation, China Petroleum, Mitsubishi, and South Korean natural gas companies.
At the same time, Qatar is stepping up its efforts to maintain its leading position in global export competition for liquefied natural gas. Currently, Qatar and Iran share the world's largest offshore gas field, the northern gas field, and Qatar has lifted the ban on new drilling in the field, with the goal of increasing its annual export capacity by 43 per cent to 1,100 metric tons annually.
Global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to reach 5.5 billion tons by 2030, according to forecasts by prominent global business information service providers.
Viola Davis recorded Jimmy Campbell's live show, which revealed the true story of Michelle Obama's role
Violet Davis is under some pressure to play Michelle Obama.
The actor said on Thursday's Jimmy Canmore Live Show, "I'm scared.
Last month it was announced that Davis would star as the former First Lady in the entertainment time network's remake of The First Lady. Davis said the script was great, but she was acutely aware that it wasn't that easy to perform.
"I don't care what I've achieved in my life, I've got an Emmy, I've got an Oscar, I've got two Tony's, but if I mess it up this time, it's going to be a defining moment in my life," she said to host Campbell.
Davids said she was waiting for her public relations officer to call and say, "Don't hang on, I'm Michelle Obama -- I'm kidding you.
Davis also considered the audience in the sixth (final) season of The Walking Dead.
She said, "Listen, I don't want to let the people who look at me go crazy.
The judge is concerned about drinking choices on the night of juvenile assault
The judge sentenced a young man who abused his enemy and expressed concern about the young man's choice of alcohol before he abused.
A 19-year-old man, Killan Cleveland, beat up a 17-year-old teenager who he believed was the culprit in his breakup with his ex-girlfriend.
The Queen's Court of Oxford was informed that Cleveland had been drinking alcoholic beverages at the Fat Fox Bar in Waterlington, Oxford, shortly before last March's riot.
Judge Nagel Dailey told Cliffton, who confessed to causing actual physical injury (ABH), that alcohol "played an important role" in the attack that night.
But he talked about Cleveland's choice of drinks: "Did you drink Coke and Italian almonds? I'm surprised you didn't get sick!
Cleveland, from Chargrow, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, 12 months' suspended imprisonment, 15 days of rehabilitation and 160 hours of "unpaid work" and paid a compensation of £750.

The Colombian president says the head of his country's Los Pelosos crime group has been killed
President Ivan Duck announced Friday that the top leader and founder of the Los Pelosos crime group was killed in an operation led by the Colombian National Police.
The group is one of the most notorious criminal organizations in the Andean State, whose fighting has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people in the eastern part of the country and in the border region with Venezuela.
Luis Antonio Quintero, also known as Pacla, was a left-wing opposition leader who commanded an additional 440 members of the group, the government said.
Parker, 49, was wanted by police for terrorism and murder, and his tracks were located in northern Santander province on Thursday.
"Our goal is very clear, to completely overthrow the organization," Duck said in a statement this week, after attending the United Nations General Assembly in the United States.
Kinthro is responsible for the organization's killing of several human rights activists and community leaders, the statement added.
Duck has been criticized by some in the international community for failing to take more action to stop killings across the country and for remaining at large.
Another head of Los Pelosos was also arrested in the operation, the statement added, but did not mention the details of Quintero's death.
Speaking at the United Nations, Tunbury inspired Dutch climate change protesters
On Friday, tens of thousands of Dutch teenagers took part in a boycott of global climate change protests, blocking local traffic, and asking their leaders, "How dare you do this?" They quoted Sweden's radical environmentalist girl, Greta Tongbery, as shouting at the United Nations.

The number of participants in the Hague march exceeded expectations and the organisers estimated the number of protesters to be about 35,000. The police were forced to change the route of the march and guide the protesters to places that could accommodate more people.
Tenbury, 16, delivered a passionate speech at the UN climate action summit in New York this week, after millions of worldwide strikes on Friday joined in protesting climate change and supporting the UN climate action summit.
"When people keep joining the protests, strikes have a huge impact, not only on today, but on the future, and we can see people from all walks of life coming in," protester Randall Rustam said.
The protesters crossed the city centre, shouting and holding pictures of Tunbury, with signs on their hands: "For the beauty of Greta", "Don't be like a foolish old antique", and "You die because of old age, we die because of climate change."
"I understand their concerns and I believe people have heard their calls," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Lutte told reporters at a weekly press conference when protesters marched not far from him. "We have put forward some costly plans to deal with these problems, but the way they are implemented has to be flexible so that jobs can be created.
At the beginning of the Climate Action Summit, a brief speech by Mr. Tongberley shocked everyone. Its aim was to mobilize governments and businesses to break the international community's paralysis in carbon emissions action. Despite decades of warnings from scientists about the impact of climate change, global carbon emissions reached record highs last year.
It's all wrong. I shouldn't be sitting here. I should be going to school on the shore of the ocean, and you're looking for our young people. How dare you do that?
The Netherlands has 17.7 million inhabitants, and renewable energy generated less than 7% of its total energy in 2017, compared to 15% in Germany and more than 50% in Sweden.
The Dutch government has pledged to halve its 1990 emissions of carbon dioxide by 2030, but has achieved only 13% by 2017.
On Friday, Tuberley also participated in an escalating climate protest, when the leaders of the United Nations Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) were meeting in Montreal to discuss emissions reduction targets for the air transport industry.
The military faces an increasing number of suicides
This year, the suicide rate among active soldiers has soared to record highs, and the continuation of the situation is deadly, Pentagon officials say, depressing and is responding positively.
According to figures released on Thursday by the Pentagon, the rate of suicide and the total number of suicides in the army, navy and navy troops is on the rise, while the rate of suicide in the air force alone is on the decline. The number of suicides among members of the Reserve Force and the National Civilian Police Guard is also on the rise.
Earlier this month, the Navy reported that three crew members on board the George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier had ended their lives within a week, highlighting difficulties in identifying potentially problematic crew members and in finding ways to prevent suicide.
"I hope I can tell you that we have found the answer to prevent the armed forces from committing suicides in the future. But we have not found the answer. We are trapped in what some people say is a national wave of young people committing suicide," said Defence Minister Mark Esper, when asked about the suicides of aircraft carrier crew members.
The number of suicides in the U.S. Army rose from 511 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. According to Pentagon reports, the highest risk groups were young soldiers, who at least 60% chose guns to commit suicide. Army suicides rose from 114 to 139, Marine suicides from 43 to 58, Navy suicides from 65 to 68, and Air Force suicides dropped from 63 to 60.
"Our figures are not moving in the right direction," said Elizabeth Van Vinck, director of the Pentagon's Office for Military Resilience, adding that most soldiers are treated very differently from civilians.
The military and defence leaders have expressed disappointment and are determined to take more measures to improve the force's resilience, train soldiers how to respond more effectively to pressure, and encourage troops to seek help when they need it, Van Wenck said. The military is also considering strengthening training in the security of the troops' stockpiles of guns and drugs. She said there are no uniform rules or regulations among departments to require guns to be locked up or other control measures, but some states or bases have their own limitations.
She and Karen Ovis, director of the Office for Suicide Prevention, said it was difficult to identify officers who might be in pain or have suicidal thoughts, and that sometimes suicide was a sudden impulse decision with almost no warning in advance. They said it was difficult to find reasons for suicide because there were too many factors of stress to cause it.
They also acknowledged that servicemen were reluctant to seek help on their own because they feared it would affect promotion or security checks. Military leaders said they had to work harder to address issues that were seen as impeding development.
In addition to health, gun training, training and education, the Marine Corps must be free to discuss life's difficulties, mental health and suicide. We must create a community that allows us to seek help and help to make important decisions for the Marine Corps and the Marines, said General David Birge, commander of the Marine Corps.
This year, for the first time, the Pentagon has included statistics on soldier's spouses and family members who commit suicide, but officials are working to improve their ability to collect family-related data, Van Vinck said.
According to the data reported, 186 families committed suicide, 123 of which were spouses and 63 were family members aged 12 to 23.
The vast majority (nearly 70 per cent) were female spouses under 40 years of age, and 70 per cent of the family members who committed suicide were men. About half of the family members who committed suicide were over 18 years of age, and for those younger, the majority of suicides were young people between 15 and 17.
Seth Myers is dumb in Donald Trump's impression of Tango and Cash
On Thursday, late-night show host Seth Myers brought a moment of relaxation to a week that had been overwhelmed by large-scale shootings, joking at Donald Trump, but laughing himself in the intersection.
The comedian referred to Trump’s visit to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where victims of a weekend mass shooting received treatment while his campaign was still owed more than $50,000 to the city for a February political rally.
Due to the failure to pay on time, the activity also resulted in one-off arrears.
"This is Mr. President's usual tune," he said. "I am surprised that his presidential desk is not flooded with unrecorded DVDs," he said.
He then began to imitate Trump in the 1989 hit film Tango with Cash, but he soon found himself invincible.
After the bullet was found in the skull of the woman, the man went to prison
A man in Georgia was sentenced to 25 years in prison for shooting his girlfriend when he realized that he had left a bullet in his head and survived while his girlfriend was in hospital for headaches.
According to press reports, 39-year-old Geraldine Kahn was convicted Thursday on charges including possession of a gun in 2017 when he attacked 42-year-old Nicole Gordon.
Gordon, who suffers from severe headaches and loss of memory, underwent a doctor's examination last year and found a bullet in her skull.
Gordon told the police that she did not remember being shot, but that she did remember arguing with Karen when her car window broke and she fell asleep. She thought she was injured by the broken glass, and she was wrapped up in Karen's mother's house.
The men's fashion show on the T stage in Paris was a big surprise
As Miss Gaga sang in her 2008 hit song, "Roman Death," "Go, go, fashion baby."
One editor said that a man who kept these words in mind, whose T-spot show discouraged other models, was the closing model for the John Galliano Magella 2020 spring series on Wednesday's fashion week in Paris.
The man named Leon Damm, 20 years old this year, conquered the audience with a unique T-track magic cat walk. He walked upright, his legs stepped forward with force, uncompromisingly, and his eyes held a strong determination and boldness.
Dressed in a leather jacket, white shorts, and knee-length boots, and wearing a student hat, he has sparked controversy online.In a catwalk show video, when he passes by fashion editor Anna Winter, the latter appears to smile on his face.
Many praised the young German model, who was known for his unique sense of fashion when he participated in the selections for the Jill Sand, Faye and Korean hard-core men's clothing brands.
Actress and "Beaverly's Sweet Wife" star Lisa Lynna describes Leon as her "spiritual specialty", while fashion designer and singer Rihanna focuses on him on the photo wall application.
Following the release of Leon's walk-through video, a fan wrote on Leon's page: "This video and the departure are truly remarkable," and another fan said, "Dear Leon," while the makeup artist and actor Peter McGraugh, who was also the makeup artist for the show, left him with flashes and flames of expression.
The highest praise may come from Time magazine editor Tim Blanks, a fashion website's fashion business commentator.
"You were an unknown young man when you left, but now you are a hot-blooded star," Brooks wrote in the title of a photo wall application on Wednesday, quoting a classic phrase from the film Forty-two Street.
He added, "I think they're right. Nobody's "well-being like Dam!"
There will be a Geomagnetic Storm in late September
Earth's magnetic disturbance is expected from September 27 to September 29, according to the Space Weather Forecast Center of the National Aeronautical and Marine Research Agency (NASA). High-speed solar winds could lead to Typhoon Central (G2)
The Russian Solar Activity Laboratory at the Lebedev Institute predicts that the disturbance will begin in the evening of September 27 and reach its peak at noon the next morning. The planetary index could jump to 5 Kp.
Geomagnetic storms can affect people with cardiovascular problems. Doctors warn that some people may experience angina, concussion, headache and lack of attention. Magnetic disturbances can also affect people with mental disorders.
If more disturbance occurs, the grid will fluctuate. Satellite signals that provide navigation information will also be weak.
The spectacular polar light in the sky above the two poles is the most beautiful scenery of this phenomenon.
Sony and Disney will again work together to release Spider-Man's third film
Disney and Sony are now freezing, and Spider-Man is expected to return.
The two companies announced on Friday that they would co-produce the third film, Spider-Man, starring Tom Holland.
According to a press release issued by both sides, the untitled film will be released on July 16, 2021, produced by Disney's Marvel Studios and its president Kevin Feig.
According to the press release, Amy Pasca will also produce films through Pasca Films, as she did in her previous two films starring Holland.
"The Spider-Man journey is going to continue in the universe of the Marvel film, and I am very happy to be able to continue to work on it, and I am thrilled by it," he said in a press release. "The Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story has spread all over the world and is loved by audiences of all ages.
The agreement also allows Spider-Man to appear in future Marvel films.
Fig admits that this cooperation makes the ability to fly over walls unique among superheroes.
" Spider-Man is exactly the only hero with superpowers that can cross the film's universe, so as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man universe, we never know what surprises the future will bring," he said.
It was reported that the two companies were unable to reach an agreement on a sequel to the previous film, Hero's Return, and Hero's Journey, a month and a half away from the end of Spider-Man.
Disney, which owns the character, reportedly hoped to co-invest in Sony's future films, and had agreed to own the film rights before Disney acquired Marvel from Mickey Mouse in 2009.
Hollywood reporters pointed out that both sides had every reason to work together. "Hero's Adventure" is Sony's highest-grossing film in history, while Marvel can maximize product promotion and maintain creative control.
Also happy about the end of the stalemate was Holland himself, who expressed his joy on the photo wall application software.
Negotiating representatives of the EU and the UK are working in Belgium to reach a departure agreement
The EU's chief negotiator for Britain's departure from the EU began negotiations with British officials in Belgium on Friday to reach an agreement on departure; there is about a month to go before the agreement reaches its final deadline.
In Brussels, Michel Bannier met with Britain's departure minister, Stephen Buckley, who insisted that any agreement would exclude Ireland's "border protection measures," which had in fact ensured a soft border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Britain's departure from the EU and had become the main obstacle to negotiations.
While Britain is committed to reaching an agreement, he says there is little time left.
"I think there's a long way to go, and I think it's at the crucial moment of the negotiations," Buckley said.
The deadline for departure was 31 October, but a new UK law prohibits British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from leaving without a trade agreement and does not allow the British Parliament to approve departure before 19 October without a trade agreement.
Last week, EU negotiating representatives said they were willing to accept a replacement for border protection measures, but Irish representative Simon Corwinny said last Friday that London had not submitted a "serious" proposal.
"Unless there is a serious proposal as a basis for negotiations, the current huge differences will continue to exist," he said.
The negotiators also said there was "not much time left" and that "the British Prime Minister and his team have a responsibility" to come up with a serious proposal.
The Johnson office said on Friday that it was still "difficult to reach an agreement".
"From the Irish' point of view, we certainly think it's better to postpone the EU than to leave without an agreement," said Corvinny, "but I think there's ample reason to ask for a postponement.
EU President Jean-Claude Juncker said he and Bannier were making every effort to reach an agreement, and that if they failed to do so, it was Britain's fault.
Irish Prime Minister José Manuel Barroso said he was pessimistic about the prospects of a Brexit deal, but would urge British leaders to come up with a plan at the 17 October Brexit summit.
"The departure agreement is actually an international treaty," he said. "It's not something that can be stealthily modified or twisted at night.
The puzzle of scientists: giant planets run around small stars
Scientists were surprised to discover that in a solar system 30 light-years away, a giant tree-like planet orbiting a tiny red dwarf completely subverted the existing theory of planetary formation.
Gas giant GJ 3512b A picture of a red dwarf running around its parent star, released on September 26, 2019.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets around them, but the observed stars are not much different in size from the planets, researchers said on Thursday.
The star, GJ 3512, has about 12% of the mass of the Sun and almost half of the mass of Jupiter (the largest planet in the Solar System).
"Yes, it's very surprising," said Juan Carlos Morales, a astrophysicist at the Spanish Institute of Space Sciences in Catalonia, whose team published the results in Science magazine.
"The discovery was surprising because theoretically modeled low-mass stars usually have small planets like Earth or the small Neptune, but this time we found a Jupiter-like gas giant running around a very low-mass star," added Morales.
With the help of telescopes from the Spanish observatory of Carraalto, the researchers discovered the mainly gaseous wooden planet, which orbits the main star in an elliptical orbit with a period of 204 days.
Red dwarfs have very small mass and low surface temperatures.GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but it can be compared to even larger planets.GJ 3512 is only 35% larger than Jupiter.
"The red dwarfs emit less energy, so their radiation is very weak, and their surface temperature is low, about 3,800 degrees Kelvin (6,380 degrees Fahrenheit/3,527 degrees Celsius), which explains why they are micro-red," said Morales.
There is evidence that another planet is also orbiting the red dwarf, and it is possible that a planet has been thrown out of the galaxy, explaining the elliptical orbit of the tree-like planet, said Morales.
The planets and the stars around them are born on the same disk made up of interstellar gases and dust. According to the most widely accepted model of planetary formation, the core-absorption model, the stars initially form solid particles within the disk, and the gravitational pull of the planet embryo can aggregate the gas around them, forming an atmosphere.
Another relative model is called the gravitational instability model, which may explain this unusual galaxy.
"In this case, the original disk around the young star may be larger than expected in mass and lower in temperature," Morales said. "This will cause the disk to become unstable, resulting in some dense regions forming clusters that can continue to grow until collapse and form planets.
School strikes around the world take to the streets demanding climate action
On Friday, children around the world launched another wave of school strikes calling for action on climate change, their first major action since the issue became the top item on the agenda of United Nations world leaders this week.
More than a year ago, the "Future Friday Movement," led by Swedish teenager Greta Sandberg herself, emerged as a spring blossom after the rain and millions of students took to the streets of cities such as New York, drawing the attention of developing countries in Africa.
Some of the initial protests began in New Zealand, where, according to Sangberg, organizers estimated a total of 170,000 demonstrators across the country, as well as in cities in Italy, Finland, Nigeria, Austria and India.
Friday's protests followed a week of climate negotiations at the United Nations in New York, including a speech by Ambassador Sangberg, who harshly criticized world leaders for failing to act.
"You stole my dreams and my childhood from me with your empty words," she said Tuesday. "The eyes of the next generation are staring at you, and if your choices disappoint us, I can say we will never forgive you.
The demonstrators cited a report approved by the United Nations last year, which called on governments to take measures to prevent global temperature rises above 2.7 degrees Celsius, warning that this would have terrible consequences for human life and the planet.
Sangberg and the young people inspired by her say they will not stop their weekly classroom strikes until they see the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change decrease.
In the Nigerian capital of Abuja, Oradasu Adinek went on strike on Friday for 46 consecutive days with photos posted on Twitter of students wearing blue school uniforms and cross-sections with slogans "Climate change is happening real" and "We don't have a lot of time".
In August, hundreds of climate workers gathered in Los Angeles, Switzerland to prepare for this week's event, and thousands marched in the city, according to local reports.
Thousands more are expected to take to the streets of Helsinki, Finland, local media said schools in Helsinki would allow students to participate.
Subberg remained in North America after his visit to the United Nations and planned to participate in the climate strike in Montreal, Canada.
Serena Williams was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging Wimbledon
Tennis legend Serena Williams, winner of the seven Wimbledon Championships, was fined $10,000 for allegedly damaging London's tennis courts with balls.
According to U.S. and American cable news networks, the Winnet host, All England Club, issued a ticket to Williams, allegedly for damage caused during the June 30 outdoor practice match.
The 37-year-old tennis star appeared to laugh at the fine after winning the quarterfinals on Tuesday against Alison Rice.
When asked about the fine, she said, "To tell the truth, I didn't really mean to destroy the stadium. I just threw the bats and then I got a fine.
Williams said she didn't know how it would damage the stadium.
"I mean, if you could tell me what caused the damage, I'd be grateful. I've always been a vengeful person. Maybe I'm strong, but I don't know," she told the reporter.
Williams is in her eighth win at the Wimbledon Championships, when she will be in her 24th Grand Final, where she will face Czech player Barbara Strikova in the singles semi-finals on Thursday.
Last year, a referee at the US Open accused Williams of illegally communicating with coaches during the game. Williams defended this and was fined $17,000.
In the case, the referee issued three violations to Williams: the first was that she accepted illegal instructions, the second was that she interrupted the ball because of emotional distress, and the third was that she called the other person a "slave" when she confronted the referee.
Many Williams fans claimed that the referee's reaction to her was too harsh, especially considering the scenes of men's excitement throughout the history of the sport.
Do you know how many men do things that are worse than this, Williams told officials at the U.S. Open when she entered the court after a confrontation with the referee during the match.
Williams was not the only person to be fined this year at the Wimbledon Open, but she was fined the highest amount.
Italian Fabio Fannini was fined $3,000 for saying he "should shoot a bullet at a tennis court" after losing to American tennis player Tannis Sandgren in the third round Saturday.
Australian athlete Nick Kyrgyz received two fines, one of $3,000 and another of $5,000, for a violation of sports ethics.
The Who's Who band suspended last night's concert: Friday and Sunday performances cancelled
Roger Dartley, a 75-year-old singer who has performed eight songs but promises to come back one day, told the disappointed crowd by watching a video of how the band had made its way onto the stage.
After performing the classical 1982 song "Outstanding Front Line," Dartley announced his retirement. He had always had a voice problem, apparently following the advice of his surgeon.
The British star told the audience he was unable to finish the show: "If I continue performing for you, I'll be injured. I think it's best to see you soon ... last time I stayed in the hospital for a month, and I don't want to go again. Sorry.
Peter Thompson explained to the audience: "It looks like he can't continue performing, I'm afraid ..."
The band left the stage and originally intended to work hard to finish the rest of the show without Roger.
When he returned, Tomson said, "I'm really, really sorry. Roger's lost his voice now.
"Obviously, before the show, he saw a doctor, and you know, he sang very well on the tour. I don't know what's going on. He's been doing his best.
"I'm really sorry you can't watch the show tonight ... we can't miss it, it's Roger's performance and it's not in good condition.
The audience fully supported him, and he cheered for the 74-year-old, explaining everything that had happened, and how the band hoped to return to fulfill their commitment to the performance.
"We'll announce the date of our return as soon as possible," Tomson said. "I'm going to explain that we're going to play for one day and rest for one day, because Roger's surgeon insists that he rest for one day.
"I swear to you, we will come back and we will not let your tickets go. I love you and I am sorry to disappoint you.
After the performance, the upcoming concerts in Dallas and Denver on Fridays and Sunday nights were cancelled.
Their next performance will take place on 9 October in San Francisco. The band will start their UK tour on 16 March 2020 in Manchester.
Michael Schumacher's agent issued a statement on his condition
An official statement on Michael Schumacher's health has been released, and according to Gong.bg, the legendary figure has been recovering for nearly six years since he was injured in the 2013 Alpine skiing accident.
A few weeks ago, global media reported that the former pilot had been admitted to a hospital in Paris for treatment. Schumacher's long-time agent and family friend, Sabin Comm, issued a statement.
"Michael's health is not a public issue, so we're not going to comment on it, just because we need to protect Michael's privacy as much as possible. We know it's hard for some people to understand, but we're doing it completely on Michael's will, and we're very grateful for everyone's understanding," said Kim.
She also revealed that Schumacher was a very sensitive man, who did not want his name to appear in the headlines and even avoided being revealed before the incident happened.
The brokers urged everyone not to believe any photos leaked from social networks and yellow magazines around the world.
Authorities investigate a fatal car accident in Los Angeles National Forest and have found bodies
Police are investigating a fatal car accident in Los Angeles National Forest on Thursday afternoon.
According to police, a car with a body was found below Los Angeles Forest Road and Tahoonga Canyon Road.
It was initially reported that the car had been there for some time.
It is not yet clear how the vehicles were found.
Is a nuclear-free world imminent?
74 years ago, two nuclear bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands.
Since then, as long as there is conflict between the major powers, the threat of nuclear war will follow.
Despite various treaties attempting to suppress this threat, there are now about 14,000 nuclear weapons in the world.
Thursday is the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, but the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons seems increasingly difficult to achieve.
So, is there a political will among countries to abolish nuclear weapons?
Megan was "moving with his heart" and insisted on not abandoning his pursuit while fulfilling his duties as the Crown Prince
Megan Marker decided to "go with her heart" and insisted not to "abandon" her pursuits while fulfilling her duties as a princess, and as a member of the royal family, she hoped to become a role model for young boys and girls.
Earlier this week, during a visit to South Africa with her husband, Prince Harry, the 38-year-old Duchess of Sussex, was reportedly quoted as saying at an event to encourage women entrepreneurs at the Cape Town Woodstock Exchange.
Woodstock Exchange is the UK-South Africa Technology Centre, which promotes skills development and market access by helping entrepreneurs, especially women, acquire skills, resources and support.
At a meeting of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, the 38-year-old actress met several women entrepreneurs in the fields of technology, environmental protection and fashion, and praised them for "invigorating the next generation" of creative thinking.
In a conversation with the founders of women's science and technology, Megan strongly advocated empowering young women and girls, and expressed hope for empowering young men as well.
"We recognise the importance of not only educating girls but also being a role model for boys," said Nadia Mousagi, South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of the engineering women's association and mother of two children. "We are influential women and should be a role model for boys," People reported.
"We both have sons, and we must remember that we are not only a model for girls, but also a model for boys, not only our sons, but also the public.
She added that we didn't "feel any hierarchical notions" about Megen's attendance, because it was a "women's gathering to talk about the difficulties we face and the mission we need to accomplish to move forward, grow and change our society".
Modes Modese, founder of the skills training company Simodisa, said that although Megan was a member of the royal family, she was determined to keep moving with her heart and not give up on her inner pursuits.
"She talked about her responsibilities as a mother and a princess, and about fulfilling her inner desire to give up pursuit, not because she was a princess," Modise recalled.
You must be true to yourself.
She said the Duchess urged them to continue to cultivate their new ideas and to say how they would continue to push and move forward, and made it clear that they did so in order to set an example to others.
Modis added that she did not mean to be a member of the royal family, but to do so when facing challenges in everyday life, admitting that she felt a little "horrified" of Megan.
"She is embracing the task in such a graceful gesture," said Maurice.
"As founders, many of us have achieved remarkable results, but it's frightening to meet a member of the royal family. She's very accommodating. She's a accommodating member of the royal family.
Megan also reveals that she enjoys the pressure of being a professional mother, admitting that she finds it "heavy" but "very exciting" to be a member of the royal family and take care of Ache's children.
"I'm only five months old now as a mother, and as a professional mother traveling with a child, my God, it's so much trouble, but it's so exciting," Megan said to Laura Rosemary, CEO of Cap's Innovation Technology, a mother of two.
"Sometimes you have to deal with tough things, but when you meet people and you have a positive influence on them, you say, "Ah ha, it's all worth it.
Megan then went to the city's Mother's World agency, which trained and hired women carrying HIV.
She brought Ache some baby clothes, including a baby uniform with the words "future" and "invincible" on it, as well as items donated by her mother's friends.
A couple of parents were sentenced to six years in prison for packing a five-month-old baby in a handbag and throwing it into a trash bin
The body of a five-and-a-half-month-old baby was thrown into the garbage bin, and on Thursday his parents were sentenced to six years in prison for failing to challenge the alleged death of the baby.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney General has announced that Adam Manson, 34, and Kayna Williams, 32, have not pleaded guilty to a felony charge of child abuse and death, nor have they pleaded guilty to a special charge that they allegedly caused the death of their son, Jason Manson.
Both Manson and Williams initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The prosecutor said the two men found their son dead on the eve of New Year's Eve while drugged in a car hotel in southern Los Angeles, adding that they had left his body in their luggage boxes and thrown it into a dump near Cranshaw Square in Mount Baldwin.
In late April, after several weeks of searches at the Garbage Graveyard in Corona del Sorbonne, the authorities cancelled the search. The bodies of the child have not yet been found.
Police said in a statement at the time that they had decided in a "great mood" to end the search for Jackson, but pointed out that because they were unable to find the exact location at the dump, "there was no reasonable reason to continue the search."
The supply of medicines in the UK after departure from EU without agreement remains unclear
If there is no agreement to leave the EU, the government will still have to do "a lot" to ensure adequate medical supplies in the country, British government regulators said.
In a report released on Friday by the British National Audit Office, the government's additional leased trans-English Channel freight capacity could be delayed until the end of November (one month after the end of departure from Europe on 31 October). Approximately 12,300 medicines authorized by the UK are registered, of which 7,000 come from or through the EU, most of which will be trans-English Channel.
According to the "reasonably worst" scenario predicted by the British government, pharmaceutical shipments could be halved on the first day of non-agreed departure from Europe and could take a year to resume. It is said that the time is "extremely urgent" if the transport problem is to be resolved by the end of October.
The report also noted that the "information" on the stockpile of drugs was "insufficient", but that the stockpile was growing every day. As of 20 September, 72 per cent of the drugs had six weeks of stockpile.
"If there is no agreement to leave the EU, the UK (health) sector will be working in highly uncertain circumstances and it will be very difficult to fully implement the planned programme," the government regulator wrote.
Meg Siir, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, expressed "deep concern" about the report, saying she had seen the British government "numbers of times" miss the deadline, but this was particularly worrying.
"If the government screws it up this time, it could have serious consequences," she said.
Dr Richard Tobert of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Association said "something is out of business control" despite the fact that companies are preparing to leave the EU.
If Britain really wants to leave without an agreement, businesses need to know more about the situation and know how to use the additional cargo capacity the government is preparing, he said.
He believes that "the best way to protect patients is to ensure that a (de-EU) agreement is reached".
Cleveland Police are labelled "failure" by inspectors on all sides
The scandal-ridden Cleveland Police have become the first police force to be labelled "failure" by inspectors in all respects.
Her Majesty's Police, Fire and Rescue Service Supervisory Board assessed its overall and three key areas of work and reviewed its capacity to reduce crime, ensure public safety, operate efficiently and treat the public and its staff.
The results of the investigation indicated that, in practice, special measures should be taken against the Force, and the Police Director, the Commissioner for Police and Crime were consulted by the National Commission and asked to ensure the implementation of the plan for "significant improvements".
If there is no improvement, the Minister of the Interior can intervene to resolve the problem.
A series of scandals have plagued the team, including Hartlepool, Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Middlesbrough in northeastern England.
Six police chiefs have been replaced over the years.
In 2012, former police chief Sean Price was dismissed for serious misconduct; seven police officers were being investigated after journalists' phone calls were illegally intercepted for complaints of long-standing racial discrimination on the team.
Recently, the Inspector General of Police said the way police work was "unimaginably inefficient" and police had to share laptop computers and cameras with them.
British Police Inspector Phil Gomley said it was a "failing force" and the situation had become "serious" for nearly two years.
The report said it was "the worst police force ever investigated in the country", "finally confirmed by officials" that the police force was "serious", and that the Ministry of the Interior now needed to intervene.
"There is no controversy," he added, "and this is what the report describes in black and white.
"These results are part of the most painful and shocking one I've ever read.
Cleveland is one of the 15 troops recently inspected by the HMICFRS inspectors and is the only one that does not qualify in all areas.
"The force does not give proper priority to crime prevention. The lack of strategic direction and resources allocated to the defence work ... fails to provide adequate protection to vulnerable groups such as children. It loses opportunities to protect them and puts them at risk," he added.
He said the senior leaders had not always shown "moral behaviour" in the same way, and that "the inappropriate behaviour of the senior leaders in Cleveland is very serious and is affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the force".
"The unit has no consistent equity and respect for employees and no effective communication or understanding of employees; processes are deemed unfair, and the understanding of employees is inadequate to support employees," he added.
Despite the serious problems with the results of the investigations, the Force has indeed received some praise in dealing with serious and organized crime, but the way in which it investigates crimes must be improved.
Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Copeping said, "I am very concerned about the sad parts of the report.
"The unit has been performing too badly lately.
He said he had been assured by the incumbent police chief Richard Lewis that he would take "rapid action" as soon as he realised these mistakes.
The British Home Office had ordered Cobbing to respond to the report within 56 days.
"I am fully responsible for the improvements that have been made and for the changes that are clearly needed," Lewis said. "In the five months that I will be in office, I will see outstanding policemen and staff at all levels, and I will see the efforts and determination of the front line police to protect the safety of life and the protection of vulnerable people," he added.
Without substantial improvements fast enough, governments could intervene, as they did in the case of the collapsed prison.
But so far politicians have never asked the police force to enforce the measure, the inspectors said.
Crime, Security and Fire Minister Keith Malthouse said he encouraged the policeman to "act quickly to address these mistakes and closely monitor the position", adding that "transparency and accountability are key to building public trust in the police."
Maryland Christian School: Several sixth-grade boys in Virginia are accused of forcing black girls to cut their hair
A black high school student in Virginia accused three white boys of trapping her and cutting off her braids, which occurred at the Emmanuelle Christian School, where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, taught.
Mary Allen, a 12-year-old student at the 12 year-old private Christian School, said the boys caught her on the playground while she was resting in class, saying her braided hair was ugly and curved, and then cut off her braided hair.
"They keep laughing at me and scoffing at me, they say I'm ugly, I shouldn't be born, they say I want to get attention," Mary told Columbia's WUSA-TV in tears.
According to WUSA reports, one boy allegedly covered Mary's mouth, another boy held her hands behind her, and another boy cut off her braid with a scissor.
Mary didn't tell her family until her grandmother found out that her hair had shrunk.
"They laughed and ran away, and I just sat there," said Mary.
The incident occurred on Monday, but the shy child said she did not tell her family until Wednesday, because her grandmother noticed her hair changing. She said she was afraid of being retaliated after telling the truth.
Mary's grandmother, Cynthia Allen, said, "It's heartbreaking. I hope the school can get rid of these students. I hope the school does something about it.
Mary's family spends nearly $12,000 a year to attend the school, and the school became famous early this year after Karen Pence became an art teacher at the well-known anti-gay school.
"We attach great importance to the psychological and physical well-being of students and to zero tolerance of any form of bullying or violence. We are deeply concerned about these allegations and are communicating with the families of the victims, gathering information and providing our best support. We have also contacted the law enforcement agencies, asking them to investigate thoroughly and to consult the Farfax County Police Department for more information," the school said in a statement.
Although the school had zero tolerance for bullying, Mary said the boys had tortured her before, saying they had taken her for lunch and scolded her.
Mary's family met with school officials Thursday and the investigation continues.
Iran releases British oil tanker Stanna Aprio
Iran released a British-flagged oil tanker last Friday, two months after Iran detained it on suspicion of entering Iranian waters in violation of international law.
According to the Iranian State News Agency, the Iranian Ports and Maritime Authority has confirmed that the tanker, named Stana Anprio, left port of Abas at 9 a.m.
Eric Hannell, president and chief executive of the Swedish oil company (which operates the ship), also confirmed the ship had been released.
Eric Hannell tweeted: "The Swedish oil company and the UK North Sea Authority have confirmed that Stanna Ambrose and her crew have been released.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard detained the ship for alleged violations of international maritime law when it entered Iranian waters in the Gulf of Hormuz.
The detention of the ship, however, was widely viewed as Iran’s retaliation against the British army for capturing an oil tanker in the Strait of Gibraltar, which allegedly transported Persian oil to Syria in violation of international sanctions laws, and was released in mid-August despite the Trump administration’s efforts to extend the detention period.
The New York Times reported that Stanna Ambrose was formally approved to leave Monday, but remained at the port until the investigation into the ship's behavior was completed.
"The tanker has left Port Abbas and is heading to Dubai for medical check-ups and reporting," Hanel said. "The families of the crew have been informed that the company is currently arranging for the early repatriation of its important crew.
The tanker was a victim of escalating tensions near the Persian Gulf, where the US and Iran shot down each other’s drones near the Gulf, and at least two tankers were blown up, with the Trump administration blaming Iran for the incident.
The Trump administration recently accused Iran of attacking Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities with drones, and Tehran denied any involvement.
Prime Minister Modi tweeted a greeting to Jacques Chirac, calling him a true global politician and friend of India
Prime Minister Modi condoled the death of former French President Jacques Chirac and said India condoled the death of a true global politician and friend.
Jacques Chirac, who expressed his support for India after the 1998 nuclear test, died on Thursday at the age of 86 and served as President of France from 1995 to 2007.
"I am deeply saddened by the death of Jacques Chirac, a true global politician, who, as a friend of India, has played a decisive role in establishing and building strategic partnerships with India," Prime Minister Modi said on Twitter.
India and France established strategic partnerships during Jacques Chirac's first visit to India in January 1998, and he visited the country again as President in 2006.
Jacques Chirac is said to have been in poor health for a long time.
Uganda: Government launches oral self-testing kit for AIDS
The Ugandan Ministry of Health has launched an AIDS oral self-testing kit aimed at ensuring that citizens (especially male citizens) are able to test for HIV.
The plan aims to reduce the number of new HIV infections by 2020.
The OraQuick AIDS oral self-testing kit, produced by Orasure Technology, is designed specifically for sensitive groups such as young people aged 18 to 24, adult men and sex workers.
"Young people between the ages of 18 and 24 are our current target group. Young people of this age are our focus group and, of course, anyone over the age of 18 should be considered. We do not currently have evidence of underage disease as stipulated by the Constitution, but as more evidence emerges, we will move towards this goal. For men, we will give the test kits to their mothers and then to their sexual partners, mainly sex workers," said Jeffrey Thacy, head of HIV testing technology yesterday.
Easy to use
Previously supplied self-testing kits need to test for HIV through blood, but HIV oral self-testing kits can be tested through oral liquid.
The test box is implemented by detecting antibodies (natural defenses against human infections). If the human being is infected with HIV, the antibodies of the virus will be present in the blood and saliva. The test box is used to detect antibodies in the mouth.
According to data from the Ugandan AIDS Commission, there are 1,000 new HIV infections and 500 new AIDS deaths per week in Uganda, which means that there are 53,000 new infections and 23,000 new deaths per year.
Dr Diana Atman, the Permanent Secretary-General of the Ugandan Ministry of Health, said the launch of the product was very timely and would help people better fight AIDS.
But she urged men to take HIV testing seriously.
She added that 14 per cent of infected people still do not know that they are infected with HIV, and that more work is needed to take care of this segment of the population.
"At present, 86 per cent of HIV-infected people know their condition, which means that the remaining 14 per cent of HIV-infected people don't know their condition. So the question now is how do we use this innovative technology. For me, the reality is that ... how do we create demand for the remainder of the boxes, especially for those 14 per cent of patients who don't get the care they deserve," Dr Atman said.
However, health officials warned that food should be banned within 15 minutes of testing.
"Related studies have shown that no suicides have occurred and the Department is confident that such a tragedy can be avoided," said Mr. Thaci, adding that the detection is voluntary.
Dr. Atman said that in addition to educating users through images and videos, governments and private institutions (including all pharmacies) should also provide 24-hour free telephone consultation services.
Studies show that the accuracy of the results of testing HIV-infected and non-infected people through the OraQuick HIV self-testing kit exceeds 99%.
Qatari athletes experience high temperatures
At Friday's opening of the World Championships in Athletics, several competitors have faced their most challenging opponents: the hot, sweaty weather in Qatar.
The humidity in Doha is astounding, with temperatures hovering at around 38 degrees Celsius during the day, and athletes and track and field officials are discussing the weather in Doha, which is why they worry about some of the events.
Marathons and races are held at midnight, thus minimizing the adverse effects of high temperatures.
Although high temperatures will have a smaller impact on players competing at the Hague International Stadium, with air-conditioning indoors keeping the temperature at around 21 degrees, since the training grounds are all outdoors, the players concerned will still have to adjust their training arrangements.
"We're also from a tropical climate country, but there's nothing like it here," Bahamas coach Ronald Carter told Reuters.
"Here, you walk outside like someone's warmed you up. I guess that's the reason for the midnight race.
Athletics officials promised more medical and safety measures for marathon and running athletes.
The International Track and Field Administration (ITMO) said the women's marathon race scheduled for Friday at midnight will be held as planned, as temperatures are expected to be below 30 degrees or around 30 degrees.
The agency said its medical representatives had assured the athletes that they would monitor the weather all day and report to the teams "so as to ensure that the event ran at an acceptable level of health risk".
Athletics competitors in indoor competitions say that high temperatures shouldn't have a big impact on their performance, but they also acknowledge that training is particularly exhausting.
"I'm all shining when I'm training because the humidity is so high and I'm sweating all over," said 400m runner Ray Benjamin.
"It's like I just had a shower. But I don't think it should be too bad, because there's air conditioning in the room.
Ryan Cross, the 2016 Olympic champion, said he had to heat it up to about 38 degrees Celsius each time to prevent it from getting wet during high-temperature and humid conditions.
"The normal temperature of a lead ball is much lower than the dew point, and as soon as you take it out, it gets wet and dripping," said the American athlete.
European pole vaulter champion Amanda Duplantes, who regularly trains in hot weather in southern Louisiana, said it proved to be helpful to train in the wet weather, because the rubbing of sandstone powder on the hand " makes the grip firmer after the water hits.
But for other high jumpers who often use sticky sprays to strengthen their grip, it's harder for them to hold the pole in such moist conditions, he said.
"I understand there are problems with people who often use a viscous spray, because the touch becomes smooth and sticky," Duplantes added.
Locksmiths arrested, major prison security vulnerabilities worrying
Recently, a prison locksmith in the UK was arrested for fearing that keys in prisons would be copied, and taxpayers were charged £500,000 to replace all locks in prisons.
Concerned that copies of the keys were being sold to some of the 1,400 prisoners, Queen's Prison Wendsworth informed the police.
This suspicious security vulnerability will result in the replacement of 3,000 locks, possibly locks inside, inside, and outside the prison.
On 13 September, the police arrested a man, aged about 40, in the prison on suspicion of misconduct in public office, a man from south-west London who worked for the Government Facilities Services Limited, which provides maintenance services for 52 prisons in southern England.
Police investigations have raised concerns that some of the key markings may remain in clay before genuine key replicas are made.
However, prison officials stressed that they had not found any evidence that any prisoner had obtained the keys.
Wangtsworth Prison is a Class B prison in south-west London with a maximum capacity of 1628 prisoners and is one of the largest prisons in Western Europe. It was built in 1851 for the detention of convicted men and men on trial.
A spokesman for the Prison Authority said: "Her Majesty's Prison, Wenceslas, has upgraded the level of security at the gates as a result of a security incident which is currently undergoing a special identity check. It is uncomfortable to make further comments during the police investigation."
House Speaker Warns Trump to Stop Attacking Secretaries
We condemn the President's attack and call on our Republican colleagues to condemn it as Congress must do everything possible to protect the informant and all informants.The threat of violence from our national leaders has had a terrible impact on the entire reporting process and has had serious consequences for our democracy and national security, they said.
"We are now fully aware that our committee is seeking the testimony of the informant and others referred to in the informant's indictment published today in the House impeachment inquiry, and that our country's laws prohibit any act of discouragement, intimidation or other forms of pressure on witnesses to provide evidence to Congress," Trump said in the statement.
"Any official who has knowledge of the Commission's investigations, including the subject of the plaintiffs' complaints, will not be threatened with any intimidation, retaliation or retaliation, and all witnesses must be able to testify before Congress," they added.
The statement, issued on Thursday, coincided with a wave of “secretaries’ accusations” in Washington, where Trump’s alleged abuse of official power in the upcoming 2020 elections “is seeking the intervention of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zrensky,” and the White House’s measures to conceal it.
There's no evidence that Joe or Henry Byrd was wrong.
Just before the informant filed a “reporter’s indictment” with lawmakers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that Trump had betrayed his pledge and officially launched an impeachment investigation into the president.
Michelle Obama praises Megan Marker for "encouragement" in photo wall application
Michelle Obama expressed her profound appreciation for Megan McCarthy on Thursday in a photo wall application, describing the Duchess of Sussex as "a thoughtful leader who is breaking stereotypes and making the world a better place."
The princess and Prince Harry are currently on a 10-day royal trip to South Africa with her son, Archie Harrison Montbaton-Wensha, who earlier this week attended a youth reception and met with the head of the Obama Foundation.
"Thank you, my friend, Madame Sussexroyal @sussexroyal, you are a thoughtful leader who is breaking the rules and making the world a better place," the former First Lady wrote enthusiastically.
"She has inspired a lot of people, whether it's meeting with our @ObamaFoundation leader or helping girls around the world find education," added Michelle Obama.
Megan, who has appeared in The Golden Coat Lawyers, is a special editor for British Fashion magazine, where she interviewed Michelle Obama for the magazine's September issue. The two ladies talked happily, and the former First Lady reviewed her experiences as a mother and brought about her change.
Michelle Obama said in an interview, "It's been a master's class for mothers to learn to let go.
As a mother, I understand that most of the time it is my responsibility to provide the children with the space to explore and develop, to make them who they want to be, not what I want them to be or what I want them to be when I'm of the right age, but who they want to be.
Michelle Obama is well aware of the pressures of the global gathering and, in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine, offered some advice to the Duchess.
"The pressures I feel from myself and from others can sometimes be very great," she said, "so my biggest advice is to tolerate some of them and don't be anxious to do anything."
She continued:
"I spent the previous months at the White House worrying about my daughters, making sure they had a good start in school, and getting to know new friends, and then I went into more ambitious work, which I think is okay, even good.
Hero's Moment: The policeman jumped on a busy highway and rescued the dog who had been hit
It was a heroic moment when a policeman rushed to the busy highway to save an injured dog.
Video footage from Joseph Puglia's driving recorder showed him jumping out of the police car within seconds of seeing the dog hit by another car.
The policeman, who works in Pineras Park, Florida, wraps the injured dog in an emergency blanket, puts it in his bicycle and rushes to the nearest animal hospital.
"I didn't really feel better until I saw the dog start breathing," she told ABC News.
Thank goodness, the little dog was spared the trouble, only suffered a slight scratch.
"We gave him the nickname "lucky," the policeman said. "I think it's a good name," he said. "It's really a lucky dog.
The dog was taken to a local animal shelter and its rescuers were called heroes.
But Puglia insisted that he was just doing his job.
The policeman added that his family would be very happy to give a "lucky" home if the zoo could not find the dog's owner.
After the bankruptcy of WeWork, the first public equity market braked on companies that could not make a profit
WASHINGTON, DC (Reuters) – The reverberation of the best companies on the US stock market, especially when they are losing, has cast a shadow over the first publicly issued calendar for the rest of the year.
Surprisingly, the sudden delay in WeWork’s first public offering reveals how market confidence in companies and investors seeking financing is being eroded.
Peloton Interactive Inc. (PTON.O), whose shares fell to $24.74 and 4% the day it began trading, is continuing Friday's punishment for a more cautious market for its first public offering, with its current shares down 15% from Wednesday's first public offering.
In the past, open-market investors usually expected companies to make profits in about 18 months after their first public offering, a time-axis that has been relaxed as capitalists eagerly aspire to incorporate fast-growing revenue businesses into their portfolios.
But recent deals seem to suggest that uncertainty about the economic outlook is making investors more cautious about losing businesses they want to support.
Peloton's report said the company's revenues grew rapidly and grew at a rate of 110 per cent during the fiscal year ended June 30, but the company's operating leverage was also negative, with operating expenditures jumping 147 per cent year-on-year.
Lost Dental Company SmileDirectClub (SDC.O) became the first-listed dental company in the United States earlier this month.A study of the company's recapitalization shows that the first public offering in three years will exceed the target range and close on the first trading day.
The average return on the first public offering in 2019 is currently around 9%, below 30% at the end of June and 18% two weeks ago.
In the U.S., most of the attention in the third quarter was focused on an unrealized deal – the first public offering of We Company, WeWork's parent company.
The company originally planned to launch its first public offering in early September, but postponed its plan to launch later in 2019, then replaced its chief executive and said it was reviewing the listing schedule.
Endeavor Group Holdings (EDR.N), a entertainment and talent broker supported by Hollywood's heavy-hand broker Ali Emmanuel, has had record losses in the past when it decided at the last minute to give up its first public offering.Earlier in 2019, UBER.N and Lyft Inc (LYFT.O) had no clear profit schedules and learned the lesson from both companies and investors had begun to delay investments in companies with a history of serious losses. "This will be a dialogue between bankers, boards and senior management teams, who will say, 'These are isolated, unparalleled,' or say, 'Our mood has changed, we need to be more conservative and use different strategies,'" said David Esrich, director of the U.S.'s first public offering service for PWPA.
Jonathan Van Nesgin and Nancy Pelosi worked on a plan
Jason Van Ness, the star of The Patriotic Warrior, appeared in the United States Capitol Hill on Thursday to discuss the Bill of Rights with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (California Democrat).
The Bill will provide non-discriminatory protection to individuals belonging to sexual minorities in areas such as credit, education, employment, housing, federal financial assistance, jury services and public facilities.
The Act would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the list of protected categories.
Van Ness recently publicly admitted to being infected with HIV. He first shared a video of his cat walk in the Capitol and explained in writing that he had met with the Speaker of the House to talk about the Bill of Rights, co-existence with HIV-positive people, and the acquisition of PrEP (an AIDS prevention drug):
Afterwards, he shared a longer post describing a situation in which both sides held hands, urging his followers to bravely face Senate Majority Leader Mickey McConnell (Kentucky Republican) and pressure Republican senators to submit the Bill to the Senate for a vote:
Pelosi introduced the Bill of Rights on 13 March. It was passed by the House of Representatives in May. The bill has not yet been submitted to the Senate.
In August, the Trump administration demanded that the Supreme Court fundamentally legitimize anti-gay discrimination in the workplace, and argued at a court of friends that federal legislation on employer discrimination in the 1964 Civil Rights Act was not intended to protect individuals from being fired for their sexual orientation.
Earlier this year, Pelosi held talks with Van Ness and the other three co-stars of The Red Army, as well as with Senator Alexander Okacio Cortez (New York Democrat), to discuss policy and push the bill.
On Thursday, Pelosi shared photos of her and Van Ness clapping warmly on the balcony, thanking him for the fight:
David Edenberg is making a new documentary about animals and colors
David Edenberg is 93 years old this year, but the iconic naturalist is still not old.
He launched the pioneering Netflix documentary Our Planet, and after the success, the popular star will return with another series: The Colors of Life.
This time, the father of two children will study how animals use color in their lives through a high-tech camera specialized for the show.
The British Broadcasting Corporation revealed that the star's aim was to show "the world of color that is invisible to the naked eye", which sounds really appealing.
Although fans are looking forward to this series coming out soon, it seems that we all need to wait patiently, because it will only appear on our screens by 2021.
But we are sure it's worth waiting for.
Earlier this month, at a prestigious ceremony in London, David received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the TV Select magazine.
So far, the national treasurer's career has had a 60-year history, bringing laughter to millions.
While collecting his trophies, the reporter said enthusiastically, "Yes, what I do is not always so interesting, and sometimes people hear things they don't like!
But this is an honor and a great joy.
Speaking of the winner, TV Select magazine said: "Sir David Adenberg is still working, studying and making shows, and he is not only a British hero, but a global icon."
This week, David was again praised, and a polar expedition named after him.
The star, along with Prince William and Queen Kate, attended the naming ceremony at the Burkenhead Campbelllead Shipyard in Mercyside County.
"The world is facing all kinds of tough problems, and it's not news to any of you," he said. The young people who are most aware of this are the ones who are going to inherit the world.
Difficult problems require extensive research and fact-based solutions.
That's what this amazing expedition is going to do, find facts, seek scientific solutions to the problems facing the world today, and more and more people are going to do that in the future.
Color of Life is scheduled to be broadcast on BBC 2 in 2021, while the worldwide copyright is retained by the company.
The husband of the murdered MP, Joe Cox, said, Don't use my wife's name to get political points
Jeremy Corbin criticized Boris Johnson last night by releasing a video of the murdered senator, after Joe Cox's husband said his wife's name could not be used to get political points.
The Labour leader's video clip clips Mrs. Cox and her late-night prayers, with subtitles, "Boyce Johnson doesn't care about our street violence."
Critics say Corbin was using the murder of Joe Cox to get "cheap political points", while Cox's husband, Brendan Cox, said Labour leaders were "wrong" to attribute hate speech to "simple political parties".
Mr. Cox said, "Jerrymy is right, the best way to respect Joe is to defeat hatred and division, and he thinks the legislators have a special responsibility, and rightly so.
"But it is wrong for Jeremy to summarize hate speech as a simple political issue for a party. Although Joe is an enthusiastic Labour politician, there are things that must go beyond party politics.
Cox also shared a post saying that Joe Cox's name was "not just a political score" with a subtitle "This. Thank you." Cobbin's video began with his talk about Mrs. Cox being murdered by a far-right radical three years ago in the West York County constituency, and people reacted strongly to Cobbin.
Speaking about clips of Mrs. Cox, Johnson and the MPs, Corbin said, "The prime minister knows that these words will fuel violence and have serious consequences. The prime minister wants to split. Obviously, he doesn't care about our street violence.
He continued to criticize Johnson and called for a Labour government
"Many people are deeply concerned about Boris Johnson's remarks, which are being translated by the far-right, and when women MPs who face death threats ask him the question, Johnson doesn't care about them. It's embarrassing," Colbin added. Former Labour MP John Woodcock shared the video, saying, "You can really shut up. It's disgusting.
At the same time, Conservative MP and Commerce Minister Nadine Zahawi said, "It's a big mistake to use Joe Cox in this way, because her family has made it clear not to do it.
"If you're a little bit more modest, Jeremy Corbin, you're going to cancel the video," Johnson said in a debate earlier this week in the House of Commons over some of the speeches he had made, saying the "best way" to pay tribute to Mrs Cox was to "complete the Brexit process."Joe's sister, Kim Lidbeat, called for a reduction in extreme rhetoric, calling it "unfavourable to Joe's children."
Joe's sister told independent British television: "I've been talking openly about some of Boris Johnson's scandals - I just think it's bad for the way things are going. I can say what I think is right and what I think is wrong, but I'll try to do it in a cautious way."
Yesterday, Labour MP Ivo Cooper's daughter publicly said she had been worried about her mother's personal safety in view of the way people talk about politicians.
The House blames Trump for the border walls, but plans to use one-vote veto
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has attempted to overthrow President Donald Trump once again by using emergency powers to attack military bases (such as schools and target sites) to pay for his long-term commitment to build a border wall.
The bill was submitted to Trump with 236 votes in favour and 174 against, but he is certain to reject it, just as he rejected a similar measure in March.
The Senate passed the bill last week, but more than ten senior Republican senators condemned Trump.
Friday's vote was different because the government had recently released a list of 127 military construction projects, totalling $36 billion, which would be cancelled to cover the cost of building the border walls, including many projects in Republican constituencies and states.
Brazil says its northeastern beach leakage was not caused by its own country
Brazil's Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Bureau, the Brazilian Environmental Protection Agency, said Thursday that an analysis of large-scale oil spills on the country's northeastern beaches showed that the leaked crude oil was not produced in the country.
The agency said in a statement that since September 2, they have been conducting oil leakage investigations on several beaches in northeastern states, where local media have published photographs of turtles covered with floating oil-producing black tar.
Oil spills spread along the northeastern coast of Brazil over a total length of more than 1,500 km (932 mi), affecting local wildlife and polluting picturesque beaches in many of the country's most popular tourist destinations, including Fortno Beach in Sierra Leone and Maragohi Beach in the state of Aragon.
National Oil Company of Brazil, a state-owned oil company, said in a statement that molecular analyses of crude oil showed that the leaked crude oil was not produced or sold by the company.
Normally, crude oil is inspected before export to ensure that it meets the standards of the refinery that receives the crude oil. Crude oil produced in different oil fields can be identified based on a range of chemical components, including sulphur content, nitrogen content, acidity and viscosity.
Brazil Petroleum Regulatory Authority - Brazil's National Director of Petroleum Management, José Antonio Odonez, said the agency believed that oil may have leaked from a tanker off the coast of Brazil, but added that the possibility had not been confirmed.A statement by the Authority said it had not received any reports of leakage from any domestic oil drilling platforms.
Some turtles were oil-polluted and were sent to rehabilitation centres after being rescued in northern Rio Grande. Bodies of some other animals were also found, the Brazilian Environment and Renewable Natural Resources Bureau said, without revealing any specific species or number of deaths.
Brazil's National Petroleum Company said in a statement that although it was not involved in the leakage, it was also involved in the clean-up, with about 100 employees helping clean up the beach.
Scoda Provides Voice and Digital Assistance to Drivers
Škoda will launch a digital assistant that can be activated via voice commands. In a statement Wednesday, the Czech carmaker said drivers could use the phrase "Okay, Laura" to activate the digital assistant.
The system supports six languages and can perform a range of tasks, including navigating to destinations and searching for music. It will initially be installed in Kamiq city SUVs and compact cars Scala. According to the Škoda annual report, the Škoda brand delivered 125,000 cars worldwide in 2018, since it was acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1991.
The company's introduction of virtual voice assistants also reflects efforts made by other automakers.For example, some BMWs now have "smart personal assistants" that can be activated with buttons, calls, or "Hello, BMW," drivers can use voice commands to activate seat heating, get tire pressure information, and adjust interior temperatures.
On Thursday, SBD Automotive's senior networked auto expert Jack Palmer emailed a statement to CNBC, saying "Voice is the ideal vehicle interaction tool."
"If a virtual assistant could receive most of the drivers' commands without manipulating touch screens and buttons, the current common driver distractions would be greatly reduced," Palmer added. "Car manufacturers are already aware of this, and for this reason they are struggling to integrate their respective solutions with consumer electronics companies such as Google, Amazon, or collaborate with them.
The actions of companies such as Scoda and BMW suggest that the way people interact with cars may change, and Hanna Caseyson, an auto analyst at the market intelligence firm Intel, told CNBC via email that the company's recent report focused on why nearly 40% of American consumers who own cars 'want to use personal digital assistants in cars', adding, "This creates more opportunities for the future development of digital assistants in cars.
Ghana: World Dog Day
On Wednesday, Accra hosted an event to welcome the 13th World Dog Disease Day, which actively calls on pet owners to vaccinate their pets to protect citizens' lives.
The theme of the event was "vaccination: eradication of rabies", co-organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Agricultural Veterinary Office (AVO).
The aim of the activities was to emphasize the important role of large-scale vaccination in the eradication of canine rabies.
Speaking at the meeting, Mr. Abel Haier-Gabriel, Assistant Director-General and Representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Ghana, pointed out that stronger vaccination efforts to keep stray animals away from humans (especially children) would reduce rabies as much as possible.
According to the Global Strategy Plan for Zero-Death from rabies by 2030, "500,000 people die of rabies every year, 40% of which are children living in Asia and Africa," he said, calling for comprehensive measures to address the situation and protect children from rabies.
Mr. Hal-Gabriel said that most nomadic animals are infected with rabies, another reflection of Ghana's need to further develop a "co-operative strategy against rabies" (i.e. zero deaths by 2030), which requires pet owners to vaccinate animals suffering from a common animal disease.
He stressed that Ghana must embark on a five-year campaign and vaccination plan to raise public awareness and eliminate the risk of human rabies.
He noted that, through the Ghana Plan of Action for rabies and prevention (2018-2030), we had developed a comprehensive roadmap for the progressive eradication of rabies, with the hope of eradicating this previously under-appreciated tropical epidemic by 2030.
Mr. Hal-Gabriel pledged that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) had been prepared to cooperate with other relevant units in the prevention and control of rabies in Ghana.
The World Health Organization in Ghana, on behalf of Dr. Even Kaluva, pointed out that rabies is an epidemic disease that must be controlled in order to save lives.
He explained that, through the "zero deaths from human rabies by 2030" strategy, countries were supported in formulating and implementing national plans for the eradication of rabies, including the "integrated concept of health" and cross-sectoral cooperation.
Dr. Carlova noted that 99% of all animal diseases, including rabies, are transmitted to humans through dogs, adding that the "healthy unity" approach to controlling and ultimately eliminating rabies in humans is very appropriate.
The veterinary service director, Dr. Aziz Baa, regretted that rabies had become a global burden.
"Although rabies cannot be cured, it can be prevented by vaccination," he said, adding that it is feasible to eliminate rabies and that all animal owners must ensure that their animals are vaccinated.
Dr. Baa said that although adequate sustainable control strategies could fully prevent rabies, the death rate would still rise and the epidemic would grow, due to lack of funding and inadequate coordination.
"It is imperative that the animal department has sufficient resources to prevent rabies from spreading to dogs," he added.
A 12-year-old girl who makes the world silent
At the age of 16, Greta Tong Berry established herself as a global spokeswoman on climate change, but 27 years ago, before social media became popular, another girl had been scoffing at UN leaders on the world stage.
Her environmental campaign has been inescapable since the student strikes in Sweden organised to protest climate change; her indignant and passionate speech at the United Nations Climate Action Summit on Monday pushed her environmental campaign to its climax; she fiercely attacked those politicians who had stolen her “dreams” and “childhood” through “empty talk” while mankind was witnessing a “great catastrophe of extinction.”
The criticism she received was fierce and highly praised. The New York Magazine described her as the "Holy Virgin of protesting climate change," while The Guardian compared her speech to the meaning of the Gettysburg Address by U.S. President Lincoln.
Back in 1992, the media were also critical of Ms. Zullinger, who, at the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro at the time, sounded a similar scream, calling herself a "girl who let the world silence for five minutes," before officials in Tongberly coldly accused her of "we may not have a future."
"We're here just to tell you adults that you must change your lifestyle," she began her speech, just as Tunbury told the adults at the meeting, "We're not going to let you get away with these responsibilities."
As Tong Beri told the United Nations Climate Summit, “a huge catastrophe of extinction is coming, and you only know the fairy tale of money and economic growth all day long,” Ms. Suzuki told leaders that “losing my future is far less easy than losing elections or floating stock markets.”
"I'm afraid I'm standing in the sun because the ozone layer has opened up a hole. I'm afraid I'm breathing air because I don't know if there's any chemicals in it," said Suzuki in a speech in 1992.
The environmental problems ringing out by Suzuki Sewen reflected the world of the early 1990s, when ecological problems focused on deforestation, ozone-depleting layers and species extinction. But after several years of intervention, mankind managed to solve these problems quite successfully.
Suzuki later created an environmental think tank and worked for the United Nations Special Advisory Group to Secretary-General Kofi Annan in the early 21st century.
So what will be the future of Tong Beri? It depends on how you view the example of Ms. Sun Suu Kyi. On the one hand, what she fears most is not happening, and on the other hand, governments are still struggling with environmental problems, while accepting the warnings of children.
Assuming that the world we live in today is still there 27 years later (the world will be extinct unless mankind reduces its carbon emissions to zero in the next decade or so, according to Tunbury), the conservative girl is likely to recall her long career at the United Nations and in non-governmental organizations, which began with this famous speech.
By then, another worried child may be sending out a full-blown outrageous warning about the acid rain problems of the Martian colony.
The Scottish National Party may support Jeremy Corbin's appointment as interim prime minister to prevent a non-agreed exit
The Scottish National Party has indicated that it might support Jeremy Corbyn as the interim prime minister of the British Prime Minister's Office in order to block a non-negotiated exit.
As relations between Congressmen and the Prime Minister's Office became increasingly tense, Nikola Strigan suggested supporting the Labour leader's appointment as acting prime minister before the general election.
Mr. Corbin appealed to Conservative rebels and opposition MPs in August to support him in leading the interim government, but this was rejected, particularly by Liberal Democrat leader Joe Stevenson.
On the basis of these proposals, the opposition attempted to remove Boris Johnson by a "no-confidence vote" and then form a coalition government seeking a postponement to prevent Britain from leaving the EU on 31 October.
The plan did not gain cross-party support at the time, but senior members of the Scottish National Party feared that if no agreement was reached before 19 October, Mr. Johnson would ignore the law and force him to delay Britain's withdrawal from Europe.
The leader of the Scottish National Party, Nikola Strigan, suggested that the postponement could be ensured by appointing Corbin, because it was a "bad idea" to let Johnson be in charge.
In response to a suggestion to appoint a Labour leader or another interim prime minister, she said, "I agree with that.
A vote of no confidence unites opposition centered on one person, with the sole aim of ensuring a postponement and then an immediate election.
Everything is risky, but to leave Johnson in office and force him not to reach any agreement, or even to reach a bad agreement, seems to me to be the solution.
Senior congressmen Harriet Haman and Ken Clark have both been nominated as potential candidates to lead the coalition government, but senior SNP officials insist that Labour leaders must do so.
"We will have to elect a new prime minister through a 'no-confidence vote' so that we can ask for a postponement of departure from Europe and hold a general election, which is becoming clearer and clearer," the source said in a rumour to British Independent television.
It is too complicated to try to find a compromise and national unity candidate, especially now that we have a candidate. Whether people like it or not, Cobbin must be the interim prime minister.
A spokesman for the Scottish National Party said the party was committed to preventing a non-agreed withdrawal from the EU and "removing as soon as possible the dangerous and undemocratic incumbent prime minister".
The spokesman said, "If there is political will, it is now possible for the parties to unite to ensure that the postponement letter does not fall into the hands of Boris Johnson and his cronies, who have made a determination to find a solution to avoid the Bann Act, but issued by the Provisional Acting Prime Minister, who will serve only for the necessary period of time and then hold elections immediately."
We remain open to all options to achieve the goal of stopping a non-negotiated departure from Europe and waiving Boris Johnson."
Even with the support of the Scottish National Party, this will also be a decisive vote for Mr. Corbin. With 288 Conservative MPs and 10 Democrats, the opposition needs to attract some of the 34 independent MPs.
The Labour Party considers the plan to be "the simplest and most democratic way to stop a non-negotiated exit from Europe".
However, the Liberal Democratic Party believes that the interim government under Mr. Corbin needs the support of former Conservative MPs and his party's traitors and cannot therefore obtain the necessary support in the House.
"This report confirms many people's long-standing doubts that Scottish National Party MPs will be very happy to support Jeremy Cobbin as British Prime Minister," said Scottish Conservative MP Costney Hale.
There is no doubt that Cobb’s unwavering stance on the Second Independent Referendum (indyref2) is a determining factor for nationalists.
If he were to become prime minister, he would have opened the door for a re-run of the 2014 referendum.
Only the Conservative government stands up to those who voted "no" in what should have been a one-hundred-year event.
Charged with sexual harassment, more than 50 students from the University of Suri were banned from participating in the sports team
"People just expect the guys to do what they're supposed to do on vacation. It's an over-drinking, noisy trip," he said
However, according to the students, some of the students' behavior this year was very aggressive, especially during a game when members of a football club were provoked by their teammates to provoke women while their friends tried to "prevent" them from doing so.
"We are aware of this inappropriate behaviour," said Allen Satherland, chairman of the Sali Students Association. "As the investigations begin, any student accused of "serious" misconduct will be transferred to a school investigation under student discipline regulations."
The school officially punished three students and conducted an investigation into the football team's behaviour.
A student was expelled from school for three inappropriate sexual acts or harassment and an aggressive sexual act.
At the same time, a final warning was issued to the other two students who were also accused of harassment, asking them to apologize.
One student was banned from entering university campuses at a specific time and the other was banned from participating in organized social activities. All three students were banned from attending graduation ceremonies.
The University of Salisbury men's football club said it "felt sincere apologies" for the behaviour of its members during their trip to Croatia.
Matt de Groud should not be punished for the stigma of schizophrenia
In 2016, Matthew de Groud, who killed five people at a family gathering in Calgary, was sentenced to life imprisonment for his actions.
Now, in 2019, a hearing will decide whether he should be allowed more freedom, such as unsupervised travel. The decision will be made in the next few weeks, so during this period we will consider whether this is a good idea. There are different views on this: one believes that in view of his past violence, appeals should be made to prevent it from happening again, while the other believes in the power of change and recovery.
First of all, let's look at the more pessimistic side. De Groud did stab five people during a psychiatric episode. This was an unpredictable violent attack. He suffered from schizophrenia, which is why he was convicted of no criminal responsibility, but has since been seeing psychiatrists and taking drugs. His psychiatrist, Santos Leigh, said before the review committee, "If Matthew De Groud does it again, the consequences will be serious." Despite his feelings of progress, he still risks attacking others again. But is this reason enough to continue to be fearful? Is this reason enough to shut De Groud down?
I think the stigmatization of psychiatric patients, especially schizophrenic patients, is largely responsible for this fear. Some psychiatric diseases have become less horrible, such as emotional and anxiety disorders. But other diseases, including schizophrenia, are still highly stigmatized. This is largely because many people portray schizophrenic patients as dangerous people, with voices in their heads telling them to kill.
In fact, most schizophrenic patients are non-violent, and they are more likely to be victims of crime or violence than perpetrators. In view of this, insisting on deprivation of some of Degrad's freedom seems unreasonable if fear of re-offending is based more on prejudice towards schizophrenic patients than on actual possibilities.
I do not believe that DeGrade should never be supervised by anyone. Regulation through a similar detention system to ensure that he is still taking his drugs and drugs are effective. He argues that, unless absolutely necessary, his or other mentally ill patients are kept in isolation. This will make mentally ill patients, especially those with schizophrenia, never be able to integrate into society; thus they will continue to be stigmatised and the perception of them as dangerous criminals will be perpetuated. The courts have determined that he has no criminal responsibility, so why treat him as a prisoner rather than as a sick, now rehabilitated person?
Hungarian Prime Minister Olbann defended the country's European Commission candidate, saying "there is a solution"
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said he had a number of solutions "in his hands" after Hungary's nomination as a member of the European Commission was rejected.
According to Reuters, Romanian Socialist politician Rowana Plumb, appointed by the EU's transport minister, as well as the EU's nominee for enlargement, former Hungarian Justice Minister László Trocini, were informed that their nomination could not be considered for hearing due to disagreements in the financial statements.
"I firmly believe [Tlošinj] is the most suitable candidate for membership of the European Commission," Orban said. "Not to say that he is guilty, but that he helped the government and I ... protect Hungary from immigration interference.
The move was embarrassing to Albany, who had recommended Trojan, and who had been in constant conflict with Brussels on issues such as immigration policy.
Meet the Baby in Flight: Japan Airlines Launches Baby Selection Service to Avoid Screaming
Japan Airlines has introduced an online reservation tool that can display seats for school-age children, so long-haul flights interrupted by crying babies may no longer exist.
When children between eight and two years of age take their seats, a child identifier will automatically appear on the seat chart to remind other passengers who have not yet chosen a seat.
Japan quickly pointed out that the new features could not ensure passengers could completely avoid the noise of crying babies.
If passengers book flights through a third party, or participate in a travel group, or change their aircraft at the last minute, the graphics may not appear, as indicated on the JAL website.
Japan Airlines and other airlines have yet to come up with a way to predict the seats reserved for continuous snorers and passengers who completely tilt their seats while eating on the airplane.
Nevertheless, the move has won praise from some users on social media.
"Thank you @JAL_Official_jp for reminding me where the children are planning to shout during my 13-hour journey," businessman Rahat Ahmed wrote on Twitter.
However, some have also urged travellers to remain tolerant.
"They're babies, we used to be babies," one user wrote, "and we need to learn to tolerate, otherwise we'll soon need a map of what's common in life like calling, drinking, pissing, drunkenness and so on.
Pompey accused Syria of using chemical weapons in the May attacks
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a speech at a United Nations conference Thursday, saying the United States had determined that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.
He said U.S. officials have confirmed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government used chlorine in the May 19 attack on rebels in Idlib province.
"The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompey said at a press conference.
U.S. officials said in May that they had received reports of chemical attacks in northwestern Syria, but did not give specific conclusions at the time.
In April 2018, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France launched air strikes against Syria in response to alleged chemical attacks that claimed to have killed more than 40 people earlier that month.
“It’s different in a way, because it’s chlorine ... but know that President Trump is actively protecting the world from chemical weapons attacks,” said Pompey.
He also said the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Chemical Weapons Organization to fund investigations into other suspected uses of chemical weapons in Syria.
Pompey also called on the Assad government to release thousands of prisoners in unfair detention, including the missing American journalist Austin Tiss, who was presumed to have been imprisoned for seven years.
"He is just one of a number of American citizens who have been imprisoned in Syria and we call on the Syrian regime to release all of them.
Tesla reports that its goal is to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter
Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive of Tesla Motors.
Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, said Tesla expects to deliver 100,000 cars this quarter, a new record, after the news that Tesla's shares rose more than 5%, according to the electric vehicle news network Electrek.
Electrek said it was leaked from an e-mail sent to Tesla employees: "We expect to deliver 100,000 cars for the first time this quarter, which is an exciting milestone for our company!"
"The difficulty with this goal is to ensure that we are equipped with the right models in the right places and concentrate our resources to help achieve delivery targets by the end of the quarter," the chief executive added.
The carmaker is expected to report quarterly car deliveries in the next few days.
Last quarter Tesla delivered about 9.5 million electric cars.
Greece: 5 people deny the sale of poor women's babies through illegal adoption
Five Greek and Georgian citizens were indicted on suspicion of involvement in a criminal organization that allegedly trafficked newborns in the form of adoption.
On Friday, the five denied the allegations in the presence of the methodological officers at the base in Sesaloniki, two of whom were accused of being the main culprits.
The group allegedly recruited a number of poor Bulgarian pregnant women who were willing to give up newborn babies they were about to give birth to. Authorities say the group sold babies to Greek couples who had more than one child.
A total of 12 people were arrested this week on charges of illegal adoption and trafficking in human eggs, while 54 others were charged with conspiracy.
Police say it is one of the largest and tightest-knit groups in a similar group in Europe. The European Criminal Police Organization has assisted in the investigation of the case.
Mike Pompey said the Syrian government used chlorine chemical weapons in the May attacks
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that the United States had drawn the conclusion that the Syrian government used chlorine chemical weapons when fighting rebels in Idlib in May this year.
"The Assad regime is responsible for countless atrocities, some of which have risen to war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompey said at a news conference at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
"I have announced today that the United States has drawn the conclusion that the Assad regime used chemical weapons on 19 May," he added.
The U.S. said it had received a large number of reports in May that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army had suspected the presence of chemical substances in areas of northwestern fighting with anti-government forces; however, the U.S. had not reached a clear conclusion as to whether the Syrian Assad government had used chemical weapons.
In April 2017 and April 2018, the Trump administration bombed Syria twice with Syrian government troops suspected of using chemical weapons.
The father still hopes that the suspect who shot his son a year ago will one day fall into the net
The shooting of a 20-year-old boy in Long Beach has been going on for a year, but the victims' families have not given up hope of the killer falling into the net.
Guy Alford, the father of the victim, said, "I wish I could trade with you, son, I wish I could trade with you.
Alfred returned to the scene of the crime a year after his son Guy Alfred III was shot -- the Jack fast food chain in a box near 52nd Street and Atlantic Street. He said he wanted to draw attention to an unsolved case of his son's murder.
"Some people know things they need to say," he said.
Security footage never released showed that Alfred had stopped at the car restaurant, and a second car was behind him. Three suspects came down from the car. One of them went to the driver's seat of Alfred's car and shot him. The four people in Alfred's car jumped off the car and ran away. Then the suspects returned to their cars and drove away.
Orford said, "Wherever the snake is, he will be caught.
The sad father said he did not know who would want to hurt his son, nor did he know who was in the car when his son was shot.
"They ran out of my son's car like they did in the video, and where did they go? Did you go back and try to help him or do something? No one said a word," Orford said.
Olford said his son was a star football player at Allenny High School and then a prominent security guard at Long Beach City College's football team.At the time, Olford said, his son was trying to play and get into the first-class school and his dream was to be a nurse.
Michael Harvey, a friend of his son, said, "He's got three jobs. I'm 21 years old and he's one year younger than me, and anyone who keeps this busy and this idea of work is admired by others.
Police are still investigating the fatal shooting, and Alford said he himself did not give up.
"The problem will be solved, I can assure you," he said.
Olford personally offered a $2,000 bounty to find clues to the possible arrest and conviction of the suspect. We strongly recommend that all persons who can provide information about the crime contact the Long Beach Police Department.
Britain’s Departure from Europe Difficulties Heavy
If Johnson tries to evade his promise to demand a postponement, he will be humiliated in the European Court of Justice in Brussels, a move that would ease the mood of European officials, who are likely to agree, mainly because spending more time looking for a solution would reduce the threat of “non-negotiated departure,” which would hurt both economies.
However, European diplomats have also seen that the political stalemate in Britain has led to delays in decision-making on the part of the UK. Members of parliament can put aside differences, limit Johnson's actions and seek postponement, but that is all they can agree on. It is this parliament that has rejected three times the difficult Brexit deal reached by former Prime Minister Theresa May with the EU. Nothing will change unless elections are held, another matter for parliamentary decision-making.
Even if elections were held, prospects remain bleak, as European countries hope to resolve the chaos caused by Britain’s departure through a friendly solution. Opposition Labour’s policy of departure is painfully distorted and almost incomprehensible, while the centre-left Liberal Democrats’ proposal to abolish departure is viewed as too extreme. The longer departure drags on, the harder it is for the EU to function smoothly.
Brussels might be more optimistic if a feasible programme of agreements were on the desk at the headquarters of the European Commission in Berlin, but the reality is that such a programme does not exist.
Johnson has often criticized the former prime minister’s “back-up” programme aimed at avoiding Ireland’s return to the hard boundary and protecting the EU single market, but has not brought any credible alternatives. Officials say many of the alternatives proposed by Britain are not specific, operational, and difficult to implement in time before Britain leaves the EU on October 31.
Moreover, Johnson’s weakness will make his leaders in the EU-27 more reluctant to eliminate the focus on the “red line,” despite the British minister for “non-negotiated departure” Michael Gove’s claim that they are “adjusting” the backup plan.
The ideal outcome would be that a series of strikes against Johnson would bring the battle to a close. Europe had no choice but to negotiate with the UK’s current government while striving to maintain unity among the remaining 27 member states, and so it should continue to strive for the UK to make the most concessions, but the longer the time lags, the more difficult it will be to achieve it.
But it's more like a football game where 27 players line up to defend and the other player tries to pick up the ball and go home.
The EU is good at making rules, defining “red lines,” and sticking to them, but its unilateral willingness to impose it is short-sighted. At least before the British general election or the second referendum breaks the deadlock, Britain has been indifferent to its own internal contradictions.
Britain's departure from Europe will be difficult.
First capture of stars swallowed and torn by black holes
For the first time captured images of a giant black hole devouring and tearing stars.
Researchers in the Journal of Astrophysics said the star, which is nearly as big as our Sun and 3.75 billion light-years away, could be seen twisting and spiraling up as a result of supermassive black hole gravity.
The star was then swallowed up, and astronomers called this rare cosmic event a tidal tear.
NASA's planetary search telescope, an extrasolar planet probe satellite, captured for the first time a detailed timeline from the beginning to the end of the event.
Astronomers used a global network telescope to detect the phenomenon before observing the trans-Earth orbiting satellite, and the continuous observation area of the trans-Earth orbiting satellite designed to search for distant planets captured the initial stages of the violence.
"It's actually a combination of rationality and good luck, and sometimes it's what's needed to drive science forward," said Thomas Hollian, an astronomer at Carnegie Institute for Scientific Research, which led the study.
When stars venture too close to a supermassive black hole, they are absorbed into it, which is located at the center of most galaxies, such as the Earth's Milky Way.
The strong gravitational pull of the black hole tears the star, some of the star's material is thrown into space, and the rest is absorbed into the black hole, forming a hot, bright gas in the process of assimilation.
"In particular, we can measure the rate at which the star brightens, and we can also observe the rare decrease in the temperature of the planet and the darkness of its brightness," Mr. Holly added.
The British Commercial Commission to Investigate the Bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
The British Civil Aviation Authority said it planned to operate 72 passenger flights and return 16,000 passengers to the United Kingdom after the closure of the tourist group in Damascus.
Aviation regulators say more than 40% of passengers have been repatriated in Monday's largest peacetime repatriation operation, the Matthorn Plan.
Meanwhile, the British Parliament's Commercial Committee has launched a bankruptcy investigation into Thomas Cook, seeking to inquire into management concerns about executive pay and accounting policies.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel agency, collapsed this Monday morning, hurting hotel owners, tourist attractions and resorts around the world.
"Unfortunately, the UK's oldest tourism companies have collapsed, and the main managers of them should face public scrutiny and be held accountable for what they did before they collapsed," said Rachel Reeves, chairman of the UK's Business, Energy and Industry Strategy Committee.
The hearing will begin in mid-to-late October.
"Directors are happy to accept the opportunity to clarify the facts to prove that their actions have always been in the best interests of Thomas Cook's customers, employees and stakeholders," a company familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Why did The Times release details of the complainant
On Thursday, the Times published a single detailed account of a plaintiff whose allegations prompted the Democratic Party to launch an impeachment investigation against Trump this week.(The article said the plaintiff was a CIA official who had previously served in the White House and was highly professional in Ukraine.)
Many readers (including those involved in national security and intelligence) criticized the detailed reporting of the Times, saying it could put the reporter's life at risk and could turn a blind eye to those who wanted to report.
We expressed these concerns to the editor-in-chief of The Times, Dean Barquette, who responded in discussions with the reader center:
As the information provided by the plaintiff triggered a milestone impeachment process, the president and some supporters criticized the plaintiff's credibility, calling the plaintiff's accounts "political blackmail".
We decided to disclose limited information about the complainant, including his work in a non-political institution, and his complaints were based on an in-depth understanding of the White House, because we wanted to provide readers with information that would enable them to make their own judgments as to whether the complainant was credible.
China says it has not waged any war or invaded other countries' land
On Friday, China said it did not intend to provoke "a war or a conflict" or to "invade the territory of another country," avoiding mention of the 1962 Sino-Indian War.
“China has always been committed to addressing territorial issues and maritime delimitation disputes through negotiation and consultation,” an official white paper was released four days before the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China’s rule on October 1.
“China has maintained world peace through practical action. For 70 years, China has not initiated any war or conflict and has not invaded any part of other countries,” writes White Paper China and the World of the New Era.
While emphasizing the CCP’s “peaceful rise,” the White Paper fails to mention the 1962 bloody war with India and the large amounts of land occupied by China, particularly in the Axis region.
The Sino-Indian border dispute over the 3488 kilometres of actual control lines remains unresolved. China also claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of southern Tibet and India opposes this claim.
To date, the two countries have held 21 rounds of special representative talks to resolve border disputes.
In addition to the 1962 war, a military confrontation between India and China occurred in 2017 in Dogram, where the People's Liberation Army attempted to pave a road near a corridor known as the "Circle of India" and linked to the northeastern states of India, which Bhutan claims to own.
Finally, the problem was resolved by diplomatic means, and both sides withdrew their troops.
In 1979, a major military conflict broke out between China and Vietnam. China claimed sovereignty over the entire South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan objected.
"China and 12 of its 14 neighbours have resolved the land-boundary problem thoroughly and defined the North China-China Gulf Sea boundary," the White Paper said, noting that since the opening up and reform of 1978, China has initiated a reduction in its army of "over 400,000".
With 200,000 troops, China's army is still the largest in the world.
The prolongation of the monsoon season has caused flooding and chaos in many parts of India
India's monsoon season has been raging for nearly a month, with unprecedented rainfall causing buildings to collapse and many crops to begin to rot.
Seasonal winds in northern India tend to weaken in early September, but average rainfall this month is 37 per cent higher than normal. Experts from the Indian Meteorological Department say it would be the last season in decades if the situation persisted for a few days.
Many areas of India are still suffering from unprecedented flooding, with the most recent one in the western Indian town of Pune, where heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday resulted in the deaths of several people and the collapse of buildings causing serious damage.
The houses were flooded and people walked in front of the flooded streets, which were usually seen only when the seasonal winds were strongest.
Heavy rains also fell in other cities, such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hyderabad. Houses were severely damaged due to the continuous rainfall in northern Akhand province.
Seasonal winds are also late. Many areas lack water and farmers are prepared for possible drought disasters.
"It's not normal that it rains so much at this time of year, causing my vegetables - the walnuts, beans, peas and tomatoes I've already harvested - to rot," said Prakash Meherla, a small farmer in Bimtal, northern Kandahar.
For consumers, this seasonal wind, which comes late and late, has led to an increase in the price of onions, an important ingredient in Indian food. In cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, onions are priced at 80 rupees per kilogram (about £1), compared to 20 rupees (23 pence) normally.
The next big festival was the Ten Commandments Festival on October 8, when the Indians planted a huge cartoon portrait of Roba, a figure from the Indian epic Ramayana, with a thick beard and an evil grin.
The burning portrait of Rob represents evil over right, but these portraits are made of paper, and if the season continues, Rob may laugh to the end.
Julian Assange: The founder of a private security company that monitors WikiLeaks for the Central Intelligence Agency in the Embassy of Ecuador
When Julian Assange was living in London, a Spanish private security company employed to protect the Ecuadorian embassy in London reportedly monitored the founder of WikiLeaks by U.S. intelligence agencies.
A Spanish state newspaper reported that Spanish private security companies were suspected of providing audio and video footage of Assange's meeting with his lawyers to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
The company is reportedly under investigation by the Spanish High Court.
Assange himself filed a criminal suit, alleging that the company violated his privacy and the confidentiality of his attorney-client privilege.
The National reported that the Spanish private security company was unable to respond to a request to comment on the matter.
In April, Assange was expelled from the embassy after being transferred to the British authorities in Ecuador.
In 2012, while in custody, Assange entered the U.K. Embassy in Ecuador, where he was at risk of being extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual exploitation; Assange said he feared he would be extradited to the United States if he abandoned WikiLeaks.
In June this year, the United States formally issued an extradition request for Assange, who was charged with 18 counts of computer abuse, unauthorized leakage of defence information, and so on.
He was accused of collaborating with former U.S. intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
Mr Assange, who had previously been imprisoned for breaching Swedish extradition requirements, is now serving his sentence in the Belmarsh Prison in London, where he should have been released last week, but has been on stand trial pending an American extradition hearing to be held in London in February 2020
In May, the Swedish prosecutor's office reopened an investigation into the alleged rape of Mr Assange, which he has denied.
The plane crashed in Baltimore after the airline declared an emergency
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said it had landed safely at Baltimore Washington International Airport after a full-fledged international aircraft had declared an emergency.
Flight 328 landed at Baltimore Washington International Airport at 6:19 p.m. on Thursday due to a Boeing B777 hydraulic problem, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said in an email.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the flight had left Baltimore but its destination was unknown. The number of passengers on the flight is not yet clear. FAA is investigating the incident.
Full Energy International Airlines (Headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma) received a phone message and returned it immediately on Thursday evening.
Why do we need sweets
When we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of an extraordinary person, the leaders of the two largest democracies in the world should listen more to his principles.
Mohammed Kharammad Gandhi, born October 2, 1869, devoted his life to the cause of morality, non-violence, tolerance and social justice, leaving a valuable legacy to the world. He has had a profound impact on two of America's most important popular movements.
The influence of Gandhi on the civil rights movement began long before Martin Luther King's acceptance of his ideas.
Cassa Chavis traced her political awakening to a news film she watched at the age of eleven and two, "This half-naked man without a gun conquered the power of the British Empire," and many of the strategies he followed when he led the farm workers' movement were imitations of Gandhi.
Aside from the United States, Gambia has the same influence: for example, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yusefzai, and climate change activists all see Gambia as a light bulb.
But President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both right-wing populists whose rule lacks empathy or tolerance, have successfully formed white and Hindu constituencies in their respective countries, sparking divisions and social opposition, in addition to their recent verbal applause for Gaddafi at a large joint public rally in Houston.
From the age of eight, Modi became a member of the Indian Nationalist Organization – the National Volunteer Organization – whose former member, Nathuram Godson, assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948. Indeed, the national MPs of Modi’s ruling party, the People’s Party of India, have been highly appreciative of the murderers of Gandhi in recent years.
The Modi Government has demonstrated in many respects its anti-Gandian stance, abolishing the autonomy and statehood of the Muslim-majority provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, and imposing local blockades, as well as welcoming the predominantly Muslim Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar under extreme persecution.
Furthermore, the Modi Government has caused social unrest by establishing a national register of citizens and establishing detention camps in the border region of Assam State, apparently in order to capture non-citizens from the Muslim-majority neighbouring Bangladesh, which could result in the deprivation of the right to vote and imprisonment of nearly 200 million people.
Trump’s policies are the same: the Trump administration’s travel ban on Muslim-majority countries is a response to Islamist terrorism, and it is a factor in Modi’s policy-making. His cold-heartedness towards refugees is a reflection of the Indian government’s scorn for the suffering suffered by Rohingya, and the US detention camps are no different from those established by Modi’s regime. Trump’s incitement to racial hatred is incomparable with some painful remarks made by members of Modi’s cabinet.
At a recent joint gathering of the two leaders, a moment worthy of their learning occurred, in which Senate Majority Leader Stanley Hoye quoted Gandhi’s definition of democracy as “a democracy that gives equal opportunities to the weak and the strong.”
On the 150th anniversary of Gaddafi’s birth, if Trump and Modi can remember Gaddafi’s admonition, they should do much better in their tenure.
White House Statement: Trump Nomines Peter Gunner as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Service
On April 3, 2019, in Washington, D.C., the Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Peter Gunner, smiled at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee on the Department's budget request for fiscal 2020.
U.S. President Donald Trump has nominated Peter Garner as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Service, the White House said in a statement.
The current deputy director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mr. Gagner, was the agency's acting director, overseeing the government's response to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires.
Since his resignation in March, the agency has not had a Senate-approved head. The Department's top department, the Department of Homeland Security, determined that Ron was using a bus illegally to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina, and he subsequently resigned as director.
Earlier this month, the nomination of another Commissioner-designate, Jeffrey Baiard, was withdrawn because background investigations found him suspected of involvement in a bar fight.
Ghana's nomination is expected. He will also need a majority vote in the Senate to approve the nomination and be appointed Administrator.
The White House said that before serving as deputy director of the Department of Management in 2018, he had worked in the emergency management department of Rhode Island and served in the U.S. Navy.
The man was "assaulted" and burned at his own door
A man was burned at his own door, which police believed was a targeted attack.
The 48-year-old man caught fire outside his home in Scarmersdale, West Lanarkshire, after he was wet with a flammable liquid that is said to be gasoline.
The man was severely burned and is currently in hospital. The situation is critical but stable.
At around 1 a.m. on Thursday, police received a call to the man's home to investigate the murder.
"The incident was bad, the man was still in the hospital, and things were very bad," said the investigating detective, Pauline Sdowners.
"We are conducting a series of investigations to try to find out who is responsible.
"We are trying to verify the motives of the incident and we are convinced that it is targeted and I would like to emphasize that I do not think that the incident presently poses a threat to a wider community.
"I'd like to know who the murderer is and can report it to us.
"Are your relatives acting suspicious when they come home, smelling like cigarettes, gasoline, or having unexplained scars?
We need someone to be responsible for this terrible event.
Vulnerable Democrats Raise Concerns about Pelosi's impeachment
During the meeting, several members expressed their positions that Democrats should continue to focus their investigations on Ukraine – accusing Trump of requiring the Ukrainian president to investigate potential 2020 political opponents – rather than on other possible violations detailed in the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller.
The vast majority of Democrats agree with the strategy, which is that "confidential prosecutions" are "the focus of the moment," Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday morning.
The leaders hoped to maintain unity within the party by continuing to focus on impeachment investigations, while focusing on moderate members who had recently joined the prosecution process. Members of parliament said the Ukrainian issue was also clearer and easier to explain to the public, and that the investigation, led by the Intelligence Committee, would be less wide-ranging and progress would be faster, possibly within the next month or two.
MP Angie Craig of Minnesota, who recently joined the Democratic Party, said earlier this week that she supported the impeachment investigation because most of the previous meetings between Pelosi and Democratic leaders had been attended by members.
Craig said, "As I stand, I've always been reluctant to push the investigation just from the point of view that I want to be constrained, I want to look at the proper procedures and I want to ensure that we have all the facts - the procedures that will enable us to do that," she added, adding that she supports a small-scale investigation led by the House Intelligence Committee.
Senator Matt Carter, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, told the cable news network that he would not vote in favour of the impeachment.
The reason I am not voting now is because we have not seen all the facts.We have to assume that people are innocent, don't we?If all these things are true, we have to see what news the press is reporting and whether documents have disclosed this information.
The Democrats will soon hear from voters that they are pushing ahead with the impeachment process, and members are scheduled to return to their respective constituencies for a two-week recess in early October, the first time a large number of Conservative members have heard their voters' personal feedback since calling for the impeachment process earlier this week, and sometimes negative.
But Democratic Senator Dan Kildie of Michigan said it would be a good choice to leave at this point.
"I really don't think there's anything better to do than prepare for the boss before the impeachment proceedings," he told reporters. "It's actually a good time for us to go back and say goodbye, understand the local people's point of view, explain to them what we're doing, and then go back and move forward accordingly."
Although the MPs have returned, the process may have been faster.
Judiciary Commissioner Jamie Ruskin, a supporter of the impeachment investigation, said, "I think everyone is interested in completing this work in 2019.
Speaking to reporters Thursday night, the Maryland Democrat said, "We have always been united on the White House's emerging issues of illegality and corruption, and our job is to reduce such acts and problems through a series of nationally meaningful impeachment clauses." "We need a series of clauses to ensure that legal cases are credible and that a coherent story is told to the public.
New York-based Anthony Brindisi, a newly-adopted Democrat, refused to call for an impeachment investigation and told the United States cable news network that he was temporarily opposed to the impeachment of Trump.
"We have to talk to some of these officials, who have listed the reports here and looked at the direction of the reports," he said.
More than half of the U.S. House of Representatives said they supported the impeachment investigation, according to a U.S. cable news network, but this included many Democrats who, while saying they supported the impeachment investigation, were still waiting for the results and then deciding whether to vote in favour of Trump’s impeachment in the end. Even if the House could vote in favour of the impeachment clause, the Republican-controlled Senate would face a “stop-and-go” – one of the many reasons for political divisions within the Democratic Party.
Trump discussed former Vice President Joe Biden in a telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zrensky on July 25, and for about three days thereafter, there was a surge in support for the impeachment investigation (over 75 members of the House), with no evidence that Biden was wrong.
Trump officials say lawyers have transferred Ukrainian phone records to the security system
A senior Trump administration official acknowledged on Friday that White House lawyers had instructed Trump to transfer his July phone records with Ukraine’s President Yeltsin to a highly secure system.
Apart from the allegations on the phone, it is not yet clear what other actions have been taken to transfer the records.
The Trump administration disclosed the complainant's complaint to the public on Thursday, when the House Intelligence Committee reported that White House officials said they had been "instructed" by White House lawyers to remove their phone records from computer systems that normally store telephones.
Reportees claimed that the transcripts were usually stored in different layers of secrecy and that, according to White House officials, it was "not the first time" that President's transcripts had been placed in the system in order to protect political sensitive information rather than national security sensitive information. Complaints alleged that the White House had tried to "restrict" access to telephone records.
"In the days after receiving the phone calls, I learned from several U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock' all telephone records, especially official transcripts of routinely produced calls made by the White House Intelligence Unit," the reporter said.
On Wednesday, the White House released a non-confidential version of the phone call record, which "is not a verbatim record" but "records and memories" of the calls from those involved, indicating that Trump is seeking to help investigate the Biden family.
"The other thing is, there are a lot of rumours about Mr. Byrd's son, and he's ended an indictment, and a lot of people are trying to figure this out, and if you can do something with the Minister of Justice, it's better," he said. "Byrd's lying all over the place that he's stopped the indictment, and if you could investigate, that would sound horrible to me.
During his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden urged Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the corruption of the Ukrainian natural gas company Brisma Holdings, and whose younger son, Henry, was its director. Biden's allies insisted that he intervened because of the corruption.
But the complainants claimed that Trump was seeking foreign assistance in the 2020 election, and admitted in their complaints that the complaints were based on second-hand information.
White House lawyers demanded that instructions to modify the record be classified as "covering facts" by senior Democrats.
California Democrat Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Ukraine this week, calling it "a cover-up" and saying it would be part of the impeachment investigation.
Meanwhile, Trump’s lawyer, Jay Seculo, has undermined the importance of preserving the details of the record.
"Is this a cover-up? Think about it, said Seculo on Fox and Friends on Friday. "Isn't the White House supposed to protect communications with the President of Ukraine? Isn't it a secret and shouldn't it be a cover-up? It's a document.
Ukraine scandal: Pelosi says Bal is innocent; former US officials back investigation
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused US Justice Secretary William Barr of protecting the president “unreliably” during a controversial phone call Friday between Trump and Ukrainian leaders, prompting an impeachment investigation.
Prior to the California Democrat's statement, an unnamed intelligence official filed the indictment Thursday with U.S. intelligence supervisor Michael Atkinson, who handed it over to National Intelligence Director Joseph McQueen.
In calls on July 25, Pal and Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, were repeatedly referred to, and the indictment said White House officials were very concerned about this and were trying to “lock” the phone records.
"I think what they're going to do is hide the truth," Pelosi told Microsoft's National Broadcasting Corporation on Friday. "I think it's sad that the Department of Justice is so unreliable," he said. "Well, it's been a while, and now it's only going to make things worse.
After Trump acknowledged that he had stopped providing military aid to Ukraine, Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry this week, which was ultimately approved, but House Democrats wondered if the aid had anything to do with Trump’s request that Zelayanski investigate Henry Byden, who had worked for Ukraine’s natural gas company for five years.
Similarly, on Friday, nearly 300 US foreign policy and homeland security officials signed a letter in support of the impeachment inquiry, which said Trump’s actions constituted “serious concerns about national security.”
"We applaud Congressmen, including Speaker Pelosi, for taking us on the necessary path," the letter said. "President Trump seems to have used the power and resources of the country's highest office to invite more foreign forces to interfere in our democratic process, which would constitute an unreasonable abuse of power.
It will also represent an effort to subordinate the national interests of the United States -- and those of our closest allies and partners -- to the personal political interests of the President.
On Friday, Trump denounced the plaintiff and reiterated that the call he made with Zelayanski was a "perfect conversation"
Moreover, all second-hand information has been proven to be inaccurate and may not have been provided to him or her by any other person, leakman or spy?A party detective, he said on Twitter
The plaintiffs' complaints indicated that Vice President Peres had also interacted with Ukrainian leaders, who had also met in Poland earlier this month and said he had not discussed Joe Biden or Henry Biden.
China's Human Rights Defenders' Funeral Observatory Calls for Truth on Torture
A Chinese human rights activist was arrested and killed after placing a sign asking Chinese leader Xi Jinping to step down, and several human rights activists called for an investigation into the real cause of his death.
Wang, 38, filed a petition outside the Hunan Public Security Office in July asking Xi Jinping and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang to step down and implement a universal suffrage system in China. Police subsequently charged him with "conspiracy to provoke", a misnomer that has led many dissidents to jail.
Wang died on Monday, according to his mother and lawyers. Wang's wife, Cao Aungxia, received a telephone call from the police claiming that her husband had died in a military hospital in Hengyang City, and that Wang's guards had been detained in Hengyang. The police did not give any explanations for his death.
According to the Chinese rights organization "Civil People's Observation", Cao Aungxia later saw the remains of Wang Ming Yue, found that his mouth, ears, nose, and face were all bleeding.
The Chinese Human Rights Defenders Network (CHRD) issued a statement saying: "The Chinese government must investigate the torture and death of human rights activist Wang Miyu during his detention and prosecute those who carried out torture and extrajudicial executions."
According to Radio Free Asia, Cao said police had asked her to accept Wang's claim that she had died accidentally, but she refused. A policeman at Hengyang City Police Department said he could not comment on the case. Wang's mother told reporters that the authorities had paid her family more than RMB 200 million (approximately $22 million) in compensation.
"The fact that we don't investigate the facts or investigate the criminal liability of the parties, but only pay compensation, does not really cleanse the victims of their wrongdoing and does not effectively prevent torture," said Francis Eve, director of research at CHRD.
"In particular, the families of the victims have been de facto detained as hostages and may have been compelled to refrain from demanding the truth of the case because of the payment of compensation.
Other Chinese human rights activists have experienced similar incidents before Wang Miyu, such as the death in July last year of a grassroots lawyer, Jiang Sung, and last year's death of Uyghur scholar Muhammad Salih Aji. In 2017, Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, who was still in jail for 11 years, died of cancer because the authorities refused to treat it; in 2014, human rights activist Cao successfully attempted to attend a United Nations conference on the situation of human rights in China, but was detained on the way and then died.
According to CHRD, the authorities have since released Wang's family. Wang left behind two young children. Others involved in the case have also been put under pressure. On Wednesday, human rights lawyer She Yang and human rights activist Chen Yan Hui were held in a hotel room to discuss Wang's case, under the control of six special police officers with live ammunition. The two were released by police on Thursday.
Wang began his peacekeeping activities early in his life due to forced displacement; he had previously been detained by the police and claimed to have suffered torture.
In 2018, after calling for Xi to step down, he sent a message via the Internet that police had raided his home, forcing him to write a letter of repentance and a pledge to stop such activities.
They don't even think how they tortured me these years, even three days and three nights without dripping water, and for two hours with electric needles, and bleeding my mouth, and I wouldn't give up.
Pet owners who do not walk their dogs will face a fine of $2,700
If the owner is unable to provide basic supplies such as shelter, food and water, they will face a huge on-the-spot fine. If the owner shuts down the dog for 24 hours, the pet must be allowed to move freely for the next two hours or face prosecution.
It is Australia's first jurisdiction to recognise animal sensory abilities.
"Modern animal welfare focuses on how animals cope mentally and physically with their environment," said Chris Steele, the party's minister for urban services, who also advocated the bill at a press conference.
Police say more students arrested in protests
The Hong Kong Police said last Friday that 1,600 people have been detained for anti-democratic protests since June, while students accounted for 29 per cent, and that on weekends the police urged young people to take the right approach when planning larger gatherings.
Despite the fact that classes were not resumed until after the summer holidays, 207 high school students and college students were detained this month alone, compared to the 257 people arrested between June and August, said the Chief Police Officer of the Police Public Relations Section, Mr Shee Zheng.
The number of young people involved in violent crimes has risen and some have been charged in court, including a 16-year-old boy recently charged with arson, who could face life imprisonment if convicted; a 13-year-old girl charged with desecrating the Chinese flag, and others who attacked police and carried dangerous weapons, she said.
"It's worrying to see these young people breaking the law at such a young age and possibly having criminal records. We call on all young people to rethink their behavior and hope that education and parents can help our young people to regulate their behavior," Cheung said at a news conference.
Since June, young people have been mainly protesting the extradition bill, and the government has now agreed to withdraw it. But since then, the protest has attracted more participants, turning into a snowballing campaign against the Chinese government, which the protesters say is quietly undermining Hong Kong's sovereignty; Hong Kong was a British colony, and its sovereignty returned to China in 1997, when the Chinese government promised to exercise autonomy over Hong Kong.
The protesters have expanded their demands, including direct elections to Hong Kong leaders and police raids on protesters accused of investigating independently.
Thousands of people protested peacefully in downtown square on Friday night, accusing the police of abuse of power, waving anti-police slogans and shouting democracy slogans. The Hong Kong Government said it would investigate complaints against the police by a police supervisory body, which critics said had no real powers and no real investigative powers.
Police have approved the Civil Rights Front to organize a large rally in downtown Hong Kong on Saturday to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the 2014 umbrella campaign, during which protesters occupied the main streets of Hong Kong for 79 days demanding universal suffrage. The campaign ended without any concessions from the government.
On Sunday, protesters will also gather in Hong Kong and many cities around the world to organize "anti-extremist" rallies against the Chinese tyranny they condemn.
Shee Zhong called on the protesters to stop conducting peaceful protests, as they had done before the gathering, such as throwing gasoline bombs, causing street fires and destroying public facilities. Police used tear gas, high-pressure water guns and other measures to deal with the protesters, prompting protesters to complain of their excessive use of force.
The Civil Rights Front is also planning another large-scale march on October 1, fearing that the bloody battle could put the ruling Communist Party of China in an embarrassment, as the Communist Party of China is holding a grand celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. The Hong Kong government has reduced the size of the National Day celebrations, cancelled the annual tobacco show, and replaced the reception ceremony with indoors.
Strengthened control of coffee beans in larvae after removal of herbicide panic
The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it found phosphorus residues near the highest limit in some green coffee beans products.
Phosphorus is a key component of the Bombay company's herbicide Nanda. In the U.S., a jury has ruled that people who claimed to have cancer from exposure to phosphorus can receive huge compensation. The owner of the Bombay company, Bayer, says the herbicide is safe as long as it is used properly, as does the U.S. Department of Environmental Protection.
Newman Coffee Group, one of the world's largest traders, said caffeine phosphate was one of the substances monitored in its coffee purchases. Now it is too early to predict the impact of the tight controls on Newman Coffee Group, a spokesman said.
The decision to increase the inspection frequency has little impact on the global coffee supply chain, a spokesman said. "It's not a new process, we're just reinforcing control," the spokesman told cable news network commercial channels. Coffee is being tested before it arrives from the country of origin.
It will be implemented by suppliers from the world's largest coffee producers, such as Indonesia and Brazil.
"Our farmers will continue to work with coffee growers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the proper use of weeding agents and other weeding methods," said Swiss.
In its powder and liquid beverages business, brands such as its coffee and Nespresso account for a significant share, with sales of CHF 216 billion (approximately $217 billion) in 2018.Last year, Nespresso reached an agreement to sell Starbucks bags of coffee and tea drinks worldwide.
Can grass glyphosphine cause cancer?
Some popular breakfast cereals contain more chemicals than they believe to be safe for children, say scientists from the organic food industry's environmental group, said.
Nevertheless, the EPD says grass glyphosphine is not carcinogenic and does not harm public health. In a statement in April, the EPD said ecological risks include harm to pollinator insects and weed resistance issues.
But that didn't stop tens of thousands of people from filing lawsuits against the company, claiming that exposure to pesticides caused cancer to them or their relatives.
Earlier this year, a jury ruled that Bayer paid $20 billion in damages to a Californian couple who claimed to have used pesticides on their property for 30 years and had been diagnosed with non-Hochkin lymphoma within four years. Bayer is appealing the ruling.
A 2015 study by the World Health Organization’s International Cancer Research Agency found that, based on “limited” evidence of human cancer and “sufficient” animal cancer experiments, phosphate “may cause cancer to humans.” However, a joint team of WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) later determined that phosphate was less likely to cause cancer through diet.
A man who murdered his ex-wife and six family members in Texas has been sentenced
A Utah man was convicted Thursday of murdering six family members of his ex-wife in Texas, and could face a death sentence.
The Harris County jury found that Ronald Haskell, now 39, was guilty of killing six members of the Star family in July 2014, including their parents Stephen and Katie Star, their 13-year-old son Brian, 9-year-old Emily, 7-year-old Rebecca, and 4-year-old Zach.
"We thank the jury for their attention to every piece of evidence in the case over the past few weeks," Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. "There is no doubt that Haskell has carefully planned and implemented the massacre of the Sta family.
Police say Haskell fled California to the suburb of Springs, Houston, where he shot his ex-wife's sister, brother-in-law and five children at home.
The couple and their four children were shot in the back of the head, and the fifth child, 15 years old, was spared.A teenager, Cassidy, was shot in the head and killed in a robbery.
The prosecutor demanded the death penalty for his murder, but the jury decided whether Haskell should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
During the hearing, the defendant pleaded that Haskell was mentally ill and heard the voice of him killing the six men, and he dropped his head after reading the verdict on Thursday, according to KPRC, a U.S. National Broadcasting Corporation office in Houston.
"I think he'll be punished as much as everybody expects," said Doug Darlem, one of Haskell's defence lawyers, according to a television report. "He realized this was the most likely outcome.
The prosecution process began at the beginning of the week, with Haspel's defence lawyer, Neil Davis III, saying his team would work hard to "get rid of him. It's our job," KPRC reported.
The announcement process is expected to last about two and a half weeks, according to television reports.
Cassidy testified at the trial, attended by her family, and appeared to be praying before the guilty verdict was read on Thursday, KPRC said.
At a memorial service for her family in 2014, Cassidy thanked the community for their support and said that her parents, two brothers and two sisters "would be happy to see them again in heaven someday."
When Haskell goes to Stare's house, he pretends to be a FedEx driver, apparently looking for his ex-wife, Katie Stare's sister.
The police said he forced in and kidnapped Cassidy. Minutes later, when her family came back, Haskell tied them up and asked for information about the whereabouts of her ex-wife. They said they didn't know, they were shot in the back of the head.
Cassidy remained dead after the injury until Haskell left and was able to identify him to the police. She told the police that he was planning to drive to her grandparents' house to kill them. But after 20 minutes of police chasing Haskell and 3 hours of confrontation, he was arrested.
Given the U.S. death rate, Scotland bans mist products and electronic tobacco advertising
Ministers are considering banning advertising of electronic tobacco and smoke products.
The Chief Minister has confirmed that consultations on the initiative will take place in the next few months.
If there is evidence to support further action on the sale of such products, her government will take action "without hesitation," she said.
Meanwhile, it has been reported that diseases linked to pesticides have claimed two more lives, bringing the death toll to 11.
Smoking products (a mixture of nicotine, water, solvents and fragrances used for inhalation) are regarded as alternatives to smoking and can help prevent smoking, but their safety is not yet fully established.
But in the United States, more than 500 people are suffering from a mysterious lung disease due to smoking electronic cigarettes, and officials say hundreds of new cases have been reported in the past week alone.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Florida and Georgia announced the first cases of deaths, and 38 states currently have records of such cases, 8 of which have deaths.
Although most of the patients reported using products containing four-hydrogen cannabis phenols (a psychoactive compound in cannabis), deaths in Georgia on Wednesday were reported to have been due to "a heavy intake of over-mycotic products".
More than 100 officials at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating the causes of this mysterious disease and are warning citizens not to smoke electronic tobacco products, especially those that have been modified or purchased "on the streets" before they know more.
The chief minister confirmed that the Scottish government was "closely" monitoring developments in the U.S. and elsewhere, following the deaths caused by pesticides.
She noted that so far they had not seen any reports of deaths from pesticides in Europe.
"We are cautious," she said, "so in Scotland we have adopted Europe's strictest regulatory approach to mist products.
"The European Tobacco Products Directive restricts advertising of electronic tobacco and ensures that electronic liquids do not contain known harmful ingredients.
"The directive also limits the concentration of nicotine in electronic cigarettes.
"In Scotland, we have also introduced retail registration and mandatory age verification schemes and funded trade standards departments in all parliamentary areas to ensure that retailers comply with the regulations.
"In the coming months, we will be consulting on a comprehensive ban on advertising and promotion of pesticides.
"It is important to emphasize that we all have to remember that these devices are relatively new products, so we will continue to study their effects. We do not fully understand what these effects are, so be very cautious," she added.
"This may be one of the reasons why electronic cigarettes are not yet popular in Scotland.
"We continue to take all necessary steps, based on best evidence, to ensure that no potential harm is caused to people.
"While we have implemented the strictest management system for these products, if there is evidence that further action is needed ... we will act without hesitation.
Cambodian court accuses exile politicians of rebellion
A Cambodian court has charged seven senior opposition leaders with plotting an armed rebellion to end their self-exile and seek a coup by means of massive peaceful protests.
The Kimberley City Court also warned that anyone supporting the Cambodian opposition party's plan to overthrow the government would run the risk of long-term imprisonment.
If convicted, opposition leaders who ended their exile could face 15 to 30 years' imprisonment and supporters could face 5 to 10 years' imprisonment.According to Justice Department spokesman Qin Marlin, even attending rallies or expressing support online could be seen as a conspiracy to overthrow the government.
The political struggle has intensified since opposition leader Sam Lansey announced plans to end more than three years of exile and return to his homeland on November 9 in search of a “re-establishment of democracy,” and Thursday’s courts accused him of launching the latest round of the political struggle.
9 November is Cambodia's Independence Day, when Cambodia was liberated from French colonial rule in 1953.
"I will continue to appeal to the Cambodian people and armed forces to oppose the regime until it restores the right of the opposition to participate in the country's political life, including genuine elections," he said on Twitter earlier this week.
Last year, the pre-election court dissolved the opposition party in San Francisco to ensure that Mr. Hunson would continue to rule more authoritarianly for 40 years.
The opposition had intended to launch a strong election challenge in July 2018, which was widely viewed as politically motivated, and the Cambodian ruling People’s Party, led by Hon Son, feared it would lose out in the election.
The Honduran Government appears to be concerned about the planned return of opposition leaders, although this does not seem to be realistic, and San Francisco has called on a large number of Cambodian workers in Thailand to return with him.
Officials have vowed to arrest him as soon as he arrives in Cambodia, but speculation also exists that Cambodia may simply prevent him from entering, and that if airlines are officially notified of the ban, he may be banned from boarding aircraft to Cambodia.Neighbouring countries are unlikely to allow him to enter Cambodia from their territory.
However, the government has stepped up its arrests of supporters of San Francisco, and there have been reports of recent human attacks on opposition groups.
At the end of 2015, he was sentenced to two years in prison for criminal libel and fled abroad in order to escape imprisonment, after which the local government filed other lawsuits against him.
At the end of 2017, in a crackdown on all opposition to the Hunsen regime, the opposition’s co-founder, Gen Soka, was arrested and other senior members of the party fled overseas. Gen Soka, who has been charged with treason for establishing contacts with a US pro-democracy organization, is currently under tight custody.
This year's Turner Prize entries will be on display in Margaret from tomorrow and Brexit will be on the agenda.
Colombian artist Oscar Morello's "Excessive Increase" depicts people staring at the North Sea, but their view of the North Sea and the shoreline of continental Europe is blocked by a black canvas, which reveals only a small part of the distance through a slope on the canvas.
The award is an annual art prize established in 1984 for artists who live in the United Kingdom or are born in the United Kingdom but live elsewhere.
Exhibition designer Fio Napari explains that Murillo's work focuses on the current political and socio-economic situation in Britain, where the paper masked dolls represent the global workforce, while the blackboards represent "the dark moments of the British and even the global contemporary".
She added, "I think it's a broader meaning of shielding your eyes, which in fact means shielding your eyes from any distant view, and shielding your eyes from the light. But I think there's still a silver lining, a slope on the canvas, where you can see the sea on the horizon.
At the same time, Helen Kammock’s video work, A Long Noise, explores the roles of women that were neglected in the civil rights movement in Delhi, Northern Ireland/London, starting in 1968, and also deals with the broader global class, ethnic, and gender struggles of the late 1960s.
All works will be exhibited at the Turner Contemporary Gallery in Maghet from 28 September to 12 January 2020, and the 2019 Turner Prize winners will be announced at the award ceremony on 3 December.
The award was named after the 19th-century British landscape painter Joseph Marlode William Turner, who had given it to Jason Perry, Damian Hester, and Steve McQueen, the director of The Twelve Years of Slaves.
The man confessed to the details of the kidnapping and torture of an orthopedic surgeon
A man in Florida admitted to kidnapping an orthopedic surgeon and abusing him with a spray lamp in a bribery lease.
Justin Bosio, 34, confessed Thursday to details of the January surgeon's kidnapping and conspiracy, whose identity has not yet been revealed, the Sun Wing reported.
Bosio's lawyer, Kenneth Lang, stated that his client had been involved in the kidnapping at the behest of the defendant in the same case, Serge Corrina, and that he would be extradited from Tenerife, Spain.
According to court documents, the surgeon was abducted and pushed into a truck by a man with weapons when he left the Wal-Mart store. After several hours of torture, he returned to his car and fell into a coma. Investigators said the surgeon's wife was a client.
British Parliament rejects early elections for the second time
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was once again defeated in pushing for early elections in Britain.
The Speaker of the House said voting could not be held until 31 October (the day Britain's planned withdrawal from the EU).
This is the second time Parliament has convened since the Supreme Court's decision to suspend an unlawful election.
Meanwhile, EU chief negotiator Michael Baner said the EU was still waiting for new plans from the UK.
The United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia and deployed an air defense system to prevent Iran from attacking
US officials announced Thursday that the United States is dispatching a Patriotic Missile Force, four ground radar systems and 200 support troops to Saudi Arabia to curb Iran's increasingly aggressive actions.
Pentagon says a Sad missile defence system and two other Patriot missile units are ready if needed.
"Other countries in the region have called for attention to the situation in Iran and we hope they will contribute to international cooperation to strengthen the Saudi defence force," said Jonathan Hoffman, spokesman for the Pentagon.
Last week, US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said he would deploy more troops to the Middle East as a "defence" measure to help defend against attacks from Iran.
He said the deployment was the first step towards resolving Iran's growing violence in the region, including this month's drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, and called on other countries to step up their efforts and condemn the attacks.
Iranian-backed Yemeni rebels claimed responsibility for the September 14 attacks on the world's largest oil refinery and an important oil field, but the United States and Saudi Arabia directly condemned Iran.
"It is clear that the weapons used were produced by Iran and not fired from Yemen," Esper said on Friday, noting that all signs indicated that "Iran was responsible for the attack."
The purpose of the deployment of troops and resources is "to send out a clear message of US support for our partners" and to provide "free movement of resources," said Esper.
The Secretary of State said the U.S. called on other countries to "stand up and condemn the attacks" and contribute to the effort.
Megan Marker "Never Invited" to Return to The Goldilocks Lawyer
The film's creator, Alan Coles, stated that he had "never invited" the British Duchess of Sussex, Megan McCarthy, to return to the show, starring Rachel Zane at the big finale.
In an interview with the Hollywood News front-line, Coleson was asked whether it was initially "possible" to invite the former resident actor to "host a guest appearance" on the film's final episode after it aired in the United States.
"Now that we've finished the grand finale, I can tell you," answered Colt.
"I've thought about inviting her and I've thought about using audio material (we'll have to figure out a way to do this), but at last I didn't open my mouth because I thought "I want to respect her new life and I can't put her in a situation where she has to be invited."
"We decided not to put her in that situation, so I never spoke.
In the final episode of The Golden Lawyers, the Duchess of Sussex appears in the Montgomery scene.
Since 2011, Megan has played Rachel Zane in the New York-based political drama, until her last episode last year.
In her last season, Rachel's screenmate Mike Ross (played by Patrick Johnnis Adams) visited her from Seattle and was asked about her condition.
"If I told you how good she was, you probably wouldn't believe me," he replied.
Beat's Bulldog Killed by a Snake in Protecting a Boy in Florida
A man in Florida said he had been bitten by a snake to protect his eight-month-old beetle Zeus.
Gary Richardson told WOFL television that his family lived in Samt County, Florida, and on Monday, when his sons were cleaning Zeus' dishes outside the house, a poisonous coral snake crawled up to them. Richardson said the children didn't see the snake, but the dog saw it and attacked it.
According to Richardson, the snake bit Zeus four times. Although Zeus was rushed to the vet, he died the next day of the attack.
Germany Reports Significant Cases of West Nile Virus
The authorities reported that Germany had the first human case of the Nile virus transmitted by mosquitos, and that climate change had clearly accelerated the spread of the virus.
The German National Center for Disease Control and Tropical Medicine said on Friday that the patient had a conjunctivitis but had recovered after treatment at the hospital.
The Nile virus originates in Africa, but has spread to the north through birds and mosquitos. Several outbreaks have occurred in southern and central Europe in recent years, and cases have been confirmed in much of the United States.
"Exceptional heat during the summer has clearly accelerated the spread of the Siniro virus in the northern Alps over the past two years due to climate change," said Jonas Schmidt Chanasit of the Bernehard Knock Tropical Medicine Institute in Germany.
Less than 1% of those infected with the virus are at risk for meningitis or meningitis.
After prostate cancer surgery, the effect was good
A major study found that men undergoing prostate cancer surgery were in good condition without radiation therapy.
The examination of patients undergoing surgical treatment, the largest experiment to date, may result in thousands of patients being exempted from torture treatments that may also have painful side effects.
The Royal Masden Hospital conducted a study of 1,400 men treated for prostate cancer.
Half of the patients received immediate radiation therapy, a standard treatment to date for preventing recurrence of the disease. The remaining patients were monitored and only given radiation therapy when recurrence of the disease occurred.
Five years later, scientists found that the recurrence rates of the two groups were almost identical, while those without radiation treatment were slightly better.
Unsuccessful survival was 85% in the therapy group and 88% in the standard nursing group.
Given other factors, the difference between the two groups was adjusted to about 1 per cent.
The study, funded by the British Cancer Research Centre, found that patients receiving radiation treatment were twice as likely to worsen their urinary incontinence as those not receiving radiation treatment, one of the main side effects of prostate cancer therapy.
One year after surgery, 5.3% of patients receiving radiation treatment worsened and 2.7% of patients receiving standard care worsened.
The station claimed that television host Seth Danlap threatened to prosecute anti-gay allegations, but the allegations were actually made by him himself, as in the case of Judy Smollett
A TV host in New Orleans said he had received an anti-gay slander message from the station's Twitter account. WWL host Seth Tanlap, an openly gay man, said on Wednesday he was planning to sue the station's parent company for years working in a hostile and hateful environment. On Thursday, a surprising reversal occurred, with the New Orleans Police Department saying Tanlap's threatening message was not from elsewhere, but from Tanlap's mobile phone.
The controversial reasoning was issued earlier this month, on the same day that Danlap began his own show as usual. According to Columbia Broadcasting's WWL-TV, he announced a holiday the day after the reasoning was issued.
Danlap said in a statement that 14 people had access to the WWL Twitter account, claiming he was not the only one to use the account.
His lawyer, Megan Kief, said he had decided to participate in the lies test, thus dispelling the speculation that he himself was the perpetrator.According to WWL-TV reports, Danlap had not filed a lawsuit yet, but in a statement he said he would start soon.
In a statement, WWL said it had investigated the allegations and had decided to refer the matter to law enforcement officials.WWL said it had completed an investigation into the extremely rude and unauthorized allegations made on September 10 on its Twitter account, which directly deceived and slandered Seth Tanlap.
"We believe that the next best course of action is for the law enforcement department to take. The investigation is currently being conducted by the law enforcement department and we are unable to comment further on the specific circumstances of the investigation," WWF said in a statement.
The New Orleans Police Department disclosed their investigation into the allegations, and in Thursday's police report, the story turned around: the alleged defamation allegedly originated from Danlap's private cell phone.
Radio host Seth Tanlap said he had worked for years in a hostile and intimidating environment and threatened to sue after receiving anti-communist slander messages from his Twitter account.
According to NOLA.com, WWL accused Danlap of threatening the station purely for money. WWL alleged that the 35-year-old radio host said he would investigate the allegations and then seek compensation of more than $1.8 million. According to NOLA.com police reports, WWL said Danlap was facing personal financial problems when threatening to sue.
These allegations were made by Kevin Cassidy, senior vice president of WWL, and lawyers who his parent company attempted to disseminate. The police are still trying to verify the allegations, but the case has been classified as potentially a forgery. Louisiana defines a forgery as "the provision of threatening information to others in order to obtain anything valuable."
Violet Davis as Michelle Obama in The First Lady
Violet Davis said she felt "stressed" to play Michelle Obama in the latest television series.
The 54 - year - old actress talked about Michelle Obama on Thursday's Jimmy Kimmel Show in the American television network series The First Lady!
Davis said she had seen Michelle Obama, but did not know if the former First Lady knew she was playing the role.
"I'm nervous. I'm very nervous," Davis said. "I don't care what I've done in my life -- I've won Emmy, Oscars, two Tony Awards -- but if I mess up this time, the impact on my life will be huge.
"It's like you've raised a really good kid, but you've screwed up Michelle Obama," she said, joking.
Davis, however, said she was confident that she would write the script for Aaron Curry, who will also be the executive producer of the show.
"I promise this script is very good," Davis said. "Listen, I don't want to make my people crazy.
In The First Lady, we will explore the political and personal life of the first husbands in American history. The focus of the first season will be on Eleanor Roosevelt, Betty Ford, and Michelle Obama.
In addition to the First Lady, Davis also rejoined Dancer Washington in the Netflix remake of "Lady Lenny's Black Hip Dance", starring Dancer Washington in the lead roles of "Out of the Reverse" and "The Wall".
"I have to wear a big suit," Davis told host Jimmy Campbell, "I like this suit. I told them I wanted a very, very big suit. I wanted to look more mature.
Davis starred in the American Broadcasting Corporation's television series The Free Run, which premiered on Thursday in its sixth and final season.
The Death of Mike Miller: A Third Man Charged with Drug Trafficking
A third man has been arrested, charged with drug trafficking, and is linked to the death of singer Mike Miller due to overdose.
Steven Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit hydroxy ketones containing phentany, and last year Miller died unexpectedly from overdose of cocaine, alcohol and high-efficiency A-blockers, while holding phentany before he died.
Walter was accused of being the drug source of another man, Cameron Pettite, who had sold the drug to Miller.
Ryan Levis, 36, was arrested this week in Lake Havasu, Arizona for allegedly giving Pettite drugs as Walter's "runner".
Walter was released on supervision in a drug case in 2005, and is currently under detention.
Miller is a Pittsburgh native, and his real name is Malcolm James Miles McComik, who openly discusses his depression and addiction in lyrics, which earned him some of the biggest hip-hop fans.
After Miller's death, she posted a full-length video of him on her photo wall page and released a song, "Thank You, Next One," which was deeply affectionate to Miller.
In recent years, some musicians have died from drug abuse and overdose across Poland, including Miller.
Prince died in 2016, when he took a counterfeit medicine containing Fentany, which appeared to be an imitation of the painkiller Vicodin.
In 2016, Matthew Roberts, a guitarist for the three bands, also died of a drug overdose involving phentamines and hydrocarbons.
Women in Wal-Mart do nothing to testify
In a Wal-Mart supermarket in Mexico City, a woman accused of shop theft took extreme measures to testify, standing in the supermarket without a trace, leaving the supermarket security guards staring.
Earlier this week, a supermarket security guard at the Tampa Wal-Mart store in Mexico City filmed a woman approaching a supermarket exit as she approached the woman suspected of theft. However, when she was stopped, her reaction made the security guard unable to tell the truth.
The woman first took off her skirt, then began to go to the exit, but she may have felt sorry, and quickly turned around to take off her shirt. She took off her clothes in her hand, and left the supermarket in a hurry.
The identity of the naked shopper remains unknown, but the shopkeeper seems to have allowed her to leave the store after the improvised stripping performance.
In July, at a Wal-Mart supermarket in the town of Simfewlin, a surveillance camera filmed a woman in Pennsylvania handing over a box of potatoes. The woman in the video was clearly drunk and was charged with public obscenity, drunkenness in public, property destruction, and disturbance of public order, and quickly turned red.
This week, another British man, Steve Whitehurst, was forced to be naked in a supermarket because the supermarket found that his trousers had an unknown inflammatory substance and had to expose himself to security.
"I'm born like that, and I can't," Whitehurst told The Sun.
Government of West Bengal plans to set up a museum at the Ishwa Chandra Vidyasagar residence
Mr Gallagher replied:
The government of West Bengal plans to build a museum in the northern Calcutta residence of 19th-century social reformer Ishwa Chandra Vidyasagar, where he spent the last few years of his life, said State Secretary Patta Chatterjee.
He said Thursday that the museum would be set up in Vidyasagar's residence in Badul Baghan area, where photographs and models of Vidyasagar's life would be displayed, covering the periods from his birth in the village of Bilsingpur in Paschim-Madinipur district to his move to his residence in northern Calcutta.
To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the educational and social reformer, Chatighi, the head of the Ministry of Education, said at an event after attending the closing ceremony of the Vidya Sagar College in Badul Baghan.
The minister also published two books in the event: Ahmed Vidya saga and Jotode Vidya saga.
Some of the items used by Vidia Saga will be removed from the dusty storage room and placed in the museum for public viewing.
This, he said, would help contemporaries understand the famous man who waged a war against women's oppression and encouraged widows to remarry.
Mr. Chatterjee said that the Ministry of School Education and Higher Education would organize a one-year seminar focusing on the life and work of Vidya Sagar in schools and colleges.
Citing other activities to be undertaken by the Academy, Mr. Chatterjee said that he would publish a collection of Vidia saga, which had not been known to date.
Chief Minister Mamata Bannagi recently announced that Vidya Sagar, born in the village of Bilsinharpur, will be built into an educational tourism centre.
A bronze statue of Vidya Sagar College stands on Thursday.
"Those who opposed the social reforms in Vidiaska destroyed their half-figure, which stands in a college named after him," the minister said.
In May, the social reformer's half-figure was destroyed during a march by the chairman of the People's Party of India, Amit Shah.

Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences Confucius College "My Heart's China" Chinese Writing Contest Opens
The 26th edition of the "China in My Heart" Chinese Literacy Contest, which marks the 70th anniversary of the new China, was unveiled and presented at the Confucius Institute of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences.
China's Ambassador to Cameroon, Mr. Zhang Chung-feng, the representative of the Executive Council of Cameroon-China, Mr. Wei Xiu, the President of the Cambodian Jiangxi Chamber of Commerce, and others presented the awards to the recipients.
According to Chai Kei, the Chinese president of the Royal Cambodian Academy of Sciences, Confucius College, the competition lasts for two months, and the participants are Cambodian school pupils, middle school students (including postgraduate students) and university students (including social workers).
China's Ambassador to Cameroon, Wang Lin, is the first recipient of the first prize in the university category, and Ms Guo Lin, the first recipient of the first prize in the primary and secondary schools category, has presented the award certificate.
Chak said the entries were divided into universities and primary and secondary schools, and invited Cambodia's senior Chinese experts to form an evaluation committee, which, through first review, re-appraisal, and final review, would eventually select 1st prize, 2nd prize, 3rd prize, 10th prize, 1st prize, 2nd prize, 5th prize, 10th prize, and 20th prize.
The first prize-winner Lin Wei said he had been studying Chinese for 15 years and had had a huge impact on himself.
Through the contest, it is written to describe the welfare brought to Cambodia under the Belt and Road Strategy and the traditional friendship between the two countries. It is hoped that the younger generation will continue to add bricks and mortar to the friendship between the two countries.
The picture is for guests and winners.
Guo Lina, winner of the first prize for primary and secondary schools, said she was very excited to have the opportunity to express the feelings of China in her heart through her mother tongue and to win the prize.
The organisers said the competition not only created a positive atmosphere for the upgrading of the Sino-Thai relations, but also attracted more Cambodian students to study Chinese and study abroad in China.
Iran has started using advanced centrifuges to accelerate the production of uranium enrichment, further violating the 2015 nuclear agreement with the world's major powers, according to a report released by the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 26 June.
Advanced centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz Nuclear Facility are “accumulating or ready to accumulate uranium enrichment,” according to the IAEA’s comprehensive external report.
Since US President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal last May and imposed sanctions on Iran, Iran has been gradually breaking the limits of the 2015 nuclear deal with the major powers.
The agreement stipulated that Iran could only extract uranium from the first generation IR-1 centrifuge.
The other signatories to the agreement, Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia, have been trying to save the deal, but Tehran has repeatedly blamed Europe for not doing enough.
Japan's Foreign Minister Shinzo茂木 holds talks with Russian Foreign Minister Vladimir Lavrov in New York, where he confirms that he will advance negotiations on a peace treaty covering the territories of the four northern islands (the disputed islands of Japan and Russia, known as the "Northern Four Islands" and Russia's "Southern Thousand Islands") and develop bilateral relations in a wide range of areas, including politics and economics.
This was the first negotiations with Russia since Mao's appointment as Foreign Minister as head of the negotiations for a peace treaty.
To Russia, he said, “We hope to engage in practical consultations, including the promotion of joint economic activities (on the four northern islands).”
According to the Japanese Government, there was no detailed discussion of the territorial issue during the talks.
At the Russian-Japanese summit in December 2018, the two foreign ministers confirmed their approach to accelerating negotiations.
At the meeting, the two foreign ministers welcomed progress in consultations on joint economic activities in the field of tourism and garbage disposal.
“We hope it will be successful and will lead to the next step,” said Mr. Mawki, who said he was looking forward to the tourism pilot operations scheduled for October.
In addition, the talks confirmed that Lavrov would visit Japan in November in conjunction with the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Nagoya.

In the parliamentary vote of the same day, Tuyounetoa won 23 votes in favour, defeating rival Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure and Tourism Cecil Sika, and was elected.
Tonga is a constitutional state governed by a monarchy and has a three-way system of administrative, legislative and judicial separation.
Touionétoa also had to accept the king's appointment.
The next parliamentary elections in Tonga will be held in 2021.
Women's volleyball is expected to defend the World Cup ahead of time!
On 27 July, in a match against the Dutch women's volleyball team, the Chinese team won two consecutive games and was relegated to a 3–1 win over the Netherlands, bringing them nine consecutive wins.
The World Cup race is nearing its end, and while the crown is on the horizon, China's women's row remains unbeatable in the face of Serbia.
In the first two rounds of the match against the Netherlands, the Chinese women's volleyball team performed as strongly as ever, finishing 25:19, 25:16 ahead of the two cities, respectively, until the third round, where the team encountered setbacks.
The Dutch women's volleyball team strengthened its offensive capability in the lagging positions, and the Chinese team was struck in the first inning, plus the girls' aggressive attacks, and the errors began to increase, eventually being rebounded by the opponent at 21:25.
“In the third round, because of our mistakes, we got about eight points,” he said in an interview.
"It's normal to lose and win games with the strongest team, and it's normal to play five games, so we tell the players to concentrate," he said.
In the fourth round, the players adjusted positively, Zhang Changning opened fire at the end of the offensive, in a single game got 8 points, for the team to win.
The Chinese women's volleyball team, though one hand has touched the championship trophy, has sounded the alarm bell in the match against the Dutch team: the more crucial the moment, the more you must do everything.
In another game on 27th, Russia and the United States finished fifth, and the United States were unable to score three-thirds on their opponents, making it possible for the Chinese women's volleyball team to win a first-round bronze medal if it scored three-thirds against Serbia.
All sorts of situations are developing in favour of the Chinese women's row.
However, despite the fact that Serbia's six main players are absent, this does not mean that they will easily give three points to China.
From the current form of the rankings, the Serbian team has essentially lost the medal, which means that they can “lighten up” in the competition against China’s women’s volleyball team, laying down their burdens and pushing their opponents hard, while the Chinese team faces up to the pressure of winning, and the situation is likely to fluctuate.
Furthermore, the substitute Serbian team was not a lamb to be slaughtered, as it had previously played five games against the Netherlands, and the two Serbian teams eventually reversed the Dutch all-important squad 3–2, thus showing the thickness of the squad.
Before the start of the third stage,郎平 also said that neither side could deal well: “Osaka is going to be very difficult, and we’re still going to be ready as usual.”
Now that the crown has been crowned, the game has truly entered the “white-hot stage.”
On the strength team, the Chinese women's volleyball team is on top of the opponents, just the last crucial point, and also to see whether the girls can play the normal level, in the field to free themselves.

“For 70 years, NATO’s containment and defense measures have been based on maintaining technological advantages,” Stortenberg said in a speech at West Point Military College in the United States.
But the times are changing, he said.
"The competition we are facing is becoming more and more intense," Stettenberg said.
That is why we should redouble our efforts now to make sure that no one outweighs us.”
“Some new technologies are not developed by NATO member states,” he said.
Chinese companies are studying 5G networks.
Russia is developing an independent Internet and investing heavily in the development of next-generation weapons, such as ultrasonic missiles.”
The security of NATO’s future “ hinges on its ability to understand, accept, and apply state-of-the-art technology.”
On September 24, more than 100 people with disabilities from Changsha were invited to board the starship of Changsha, enjoying the magnificent scenery of Xiangjiang River and celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China.
More than 100 disabled people participated in the event, most of them for the first time boarding a ferry.
The 56-year-old Zhao Zhenggang is a paralyzed person who rarely goes outside due to inconvenience of walking on both legs.
“It’s the first time I’ve been on a ferry today,” he said, “and it’s exciting and unforgettable to see the shores of Xiangjiang from a distance, and to feel the pulse of Changsha’s development.”
Volunteers from the Fukang Community Workers' Service Centre and the Blue Sky Rescue Team in Changsha City provided careful and detailed services to people with disabilities.
Volunteers, especially those with severe physical disabilities, will be backed up and down the ferry.
For 70 years, with the support of the Party and the government, Cheungsha City's disabled people's cause has been developing and progressing, and more and more people with disabilities have become truly participants, contributors and beneficiaries of social economic development.
The Republic is about to celebrate its seventy-first anniversary, and the lights of the media are flashing, and many images that we don't usually remember are shining – they are the ones who brought heat and light to us on those bright days ...
However, if a hero walks by, he also seems ordinary like you and me.
Yuan Longping, a pioneer in rice research, cultivated good crops all over the world, so that tens of billions of people in the world would never again have the prospect of starvation; this man is usually like an old farmer who likes to walk around in the fields; Nan Ningdong, a chief scientist who strives to make China's "eyes" angry, a man, a lifetime, a pot, does only one thing in his lifetime, eating cold bread in the deep mountains of Guizhou, and the old man in Zhai Zhai is nothing like anything else; Zhou Yuchang, a redist, a village boy very late in the day, still like a red child, studying all the way from the middle to the west, with a fluffy white hair, and talking about learning to the heart, likes to scream scream scream scream scream scream
They, be kind and kind, live simple, simple and stubborn, and as long as they are immersed in the affairs of strangers, which they do not understand, they will easily be quick to live, and will not care for the name of the reindeer, the rich and the noble.
Like in the novel of Kim Yong, the shaman priest of Shaolin-ji Temple and his cabinet, though he admired world martial arts, did not boast, did not rejoice, did not grieve.
Every "swain monk," every red-hearted one, has a homeland behind him.
Responsibility of the home country, not only carried on the shoulders of heroes, but also held on the palms of millions of countries.
Once, a middle school girl was taken aback by a netizen who said, “When a hero walks by, there’s always someone sitting by the side of the road clapping ... ... I don’t want to be a hero, I want to be somebody who sits by the side of the road clapping.”
In fact, when hero and give the hero applause, it is not contradictory.
Those who applaud along the road are also transmitting heat and light, and they are also the emitters of light.
Ordinary like you and me, there is always a reason in life, there are moments, there are days and months, and they also shape the character of a hero.
Shanghai's excellent judge Zou Beihua, who has taken over the charge of judicial reform, has sent countless newspaper letters during the year at annual meetings to the old master of the communicating room to tell his story.
It's a pity between heroes, a hero applauding another hero.
The sailors had the Shuling Temple and the Tibetan Council, Yuan Longping had vast rice fields, Nan Ningdong had "the eyes of heaven," Qin Yi had a stage, Zhou Yuchang had an altar ... ... Can you be a hero, not only by your own efforts, but also by having a good environment and positive incentive mechanism.
China’s eyes, for example, now seem to be a myth.
In the 1990s, China’s science and technology community was still struggling, and novelist Liu Jishin had not yet started writing the novel.
At the time, the cow’s “eye” was a single-caliber radio telescope in the United States’ Puerto Rico Valley – the 350-meter-wide Arecibo, considered the world’s most “insurmountable.”
At that time, Chinese telescopes had less than one tenth the diameter of other people.
And Nan Ningdong, who enjoys world-class scientific conditions and salaries in Japan, insists on returning home, bringing back an almost crazy idea: build a new generation of radio telescopes in China, receiving more messages from outer space!
What a thrill in China, investing so much money to play stars?
The motherland trusts Nan Ningdong, the " Heavenly Eye" project opens the chaos.
It took 12 years for the site to be designated, and nine years for it to be completed.
With the opening of the 500-meter-diameter “eye of heaven,” China has achieved an unprecedented “unparalleled scientific project in the world.”
So, how great is the heavenly eye, how great is the southern neighbourhood, how great is the republic that stands high and looks out.
With the trust of the country and the goodwill of the people, the southern and eastern sides have reason to become the soul of the country and the heart of the people.
There were brave young men and white-haired heroes who walked gently, and there were people who shook hands on the roadside, and such a country is beautiful and harmonious.
Garbage classification education leads Jilin kindergarten environmental philosophy from the doll
On 27th, a kindergarten in Jilin City, Jilin Province, launched a class on the classification of garbage and taught children to distinguish between recyclable and other types of garbage.
It is reported that this waste classification entered the local kindergarten classroom for the first time.
Jointly, nine departments in Jilin province have launched the "Programme for the Advancement of Urban Living Waste Classification in Jilin Province".
On the basis of a pilot project on mandatory categorization of residential waste in Changchun City in 2019, the province decided to carry out work on the categorization of residential waste in local cities.
Jilin City is one of them.
We hope through this activity to realize the effect of bringing the child to the family, kindergarten to the society, advocating the environmental philosophy.
Mr Liu Lijuan, the executive gardener of Hi Fan International Kindergarten, said the event was being held.
On that day, the gardener read an environmental initiative book, hoping that the garbage collection would start with children.
After the children performed the low-carbon bee-bee dance, the groups made a small garbage classification game.
Instructors also issued "recyclable" "other garbage" labels, suggesting that children stick the labels to the garbage bin after they go home and record a small video.
Liu Lijuan introduced that the kindergarten has been advocating low-carbon, green environmental philosophy and regularly opens environmental lectures.
In the garden waste dumps are also set up to classify the waste buckets, which are marked with the types of dumps.
The teacher teaches the children what can be recovered from garbage
According to preliminary statistics, the amount of urban waste generated in Jilin Province in 2018 was about 546.52 million tons.
Among them, 329.29 million tonnes of sanitary filling, 29.23 million tonnes of incineration and 8.01 million tonnes of integrated utilization processing were carried out.
After many years of efforts, all the municipalities and counties of the province have the ability to handle living garbage harmlessly.
In the already issued "Programme of Work to Promote Land-level Urban Waste Treatment in Jilin Province", it is explicitly requested to carry out in-depth activities to collect waste on campus, in textbooks, in classrooms, etc., and to strengthen the interaction between students and parents through the creation of songs, songs, cartoons, micro-videos, etc., in order to achieve the effect of "educating a child, influencing a family, driving a community, and cultivating a new generation".
According to data released by Mazda on September 27, the car sold 11,7015 units worldwide in August.
Sales in China fell 21% due to insufficient new cars and reduced prices.
Japan’s domestic sales fell by 6%, and demand for last-class buses before the October consumption tax hike was limited.
In August, Mazda sold 17729 cars in China.
Sales declined steadily in August 2018, down 13% from the previous year.
Sales of China's main SUV, the CX-4, fell 14%.
The CX-4 has been on the market for a long time since its introduction in 2016, and the performance of the new car has declined.
Due to the strategy of increasing brand value from a long-term perspective and reducing the price, it is reported that it also has a big impact on sales.
Mazda's sales in the United States grew by 7% to 27482 units, growing every 14 months.
Sales of SUVs such as the CX-5 grew in August, with sales days more than last year combined with “promotion and promotional activities” (Mazda).
Domestic sales in Japan fell 6% to 14422 units.
The company says the emergency pre-tax acquisitions “have not reached the level we had last seen in 2014.”
Sales of small cars such as "Demio" have declined.
Heathrow's political legacy survives
Former French President Jacques Chirac died at the age of 86.
At a time when the world is undergoing a century of unprecedented change, the many political legacies left by the French politician during his tenure are still worthy of praise.
He served as President of France for 12 years in a very personal manner.
He inherited the diplomatic spirit of De Gaulle's independentism and firmly supported European integration, and was a representative of the pursuit of the "European dream".
At the same time, he is also a strong advocate of world multipolarization and multilateralism, a politician with a strategic vision.
For this reason, the French media hailed him as “a great representative of France on the world stage.”
One of the political decisions that Mr. Chirac made was to oppose the US-led war in Iraq.
Under his leadership, France joined Germany in overcoming US pressure and taking the front line against the war.
One year after the war broke out, he predicted that the war in Iraq would lead to an escalation of terrorism, making the world more dangerous.
Subsequent facts have shown that Hillary's warning is correct.
With European integration wandering and US unilateralism on the rise, and with the past fading away, he has undoubtedly been a powerful enlightenment in his strategic thinking and choices for international politics and global affairs.
He is also a familiar and close French politician to the Chinese.
He was one of the advocates and creators of the "Golden Decade" of Sino-French Relations. After being elected President of France for the first time in 1995, he promoted the rapid development of Sino-French relations with the strategic eye of politicians.
In 2004, China and France established a comprehensive strategic partnership, and China and France entered a new phase in their bilateral relations.
During his administration, bilateral trade between China and France grew rapidly, and the two countries made breakthrough progress in cooperation in a number of fields, including aviation, nuclear power, and rail transportation.
The Chirac-led Year of Chinese-French Culture created a new mode of cultural exchange in Chinese-French history.
His lifelong love for Chinese culture was particularly impressive.
It is known from his Chinese diplomat's introduction that he can read some of the poems by Li Bai and Du Fu, and even accurately judge the history of Chinese bronze instruments.
“No wonder the pyramids didn’t really make it to Egypt, and no wonder the terracotta didn’t really make it to China,” the golden phrase originated in Greece.
"The West is concerned about China's political and social development, about the ecological problems caused by China's economic growth, and about China's political status internationally," he said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency.
But I am confident of China.
I think China is a country with a long history of civilization, and its experience is sufficient to help it establish the ideals and values of harmonious development and assume its responsibilities on the world stage for a long time."
I also believe that China’s revival will bring new creative energy to world culture and enrich world culture.
The Scythians have gone, but the political legacy and enlightenment that Hillary left to the world will last forever.

The HKSAR Legislative Council appointed a coalition of deputies to oppose the U.S. Act on Hong Kong Interference
In a joint statement issued on 27 July, members of the HKSAR Legislative Council expressed their strong opposition to the passage of the 2019 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Bill by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives.
The statement, which was made by the 40 members of the Confederation of Honourable Members of the United Nations, stated that Hong Kong's right to trade, cooperate and develop with various countries and regions of the world in the name of "China Hong Kong" was enshrined in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Zone, including the maintenance of the status of a free-trade port and a separate tariff zone, and the signing and implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements.
These rights are not conferred on any foreign government or legislature.
Hong Kong has consistently adhered to international agreements, international rules, law and business ethics, and has engaged in cooperation with various countries and regions in many relevant fields.
The U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs did not need to pass the bill, it said, simply in response to the call of its Hong Kong agents to intervene savagely in Hong Kong's internal affairs and seek political clout for their agents in Hong Kong.
The House of Representatives deeply regrets and strongly opposes this move.
The statement noted that Hong Kong is an important trading partner of the United States and the largest source of trade surpluses.
Hong Kong's excellent rule of law, a fair and free business environment and a clean society make it a good place for American businessmen to do business.
If the US passes this bill, it will not only harm Hong Kong and its own interests, but will also make the US-China relationship snowy, and will do no harm to oneself or to others.
The declaration stated that Hong Kong would continue to enjoy the rights conferred by the Basic Law and implement its obligations effectively, as it has done in the past, without any hesitation in implementing the "one country, two systems" approach.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international community and international trade.
The French parliament's two chambers will discuss immigration policy reform next week, according to the European Times.
French President Jacques Chirac recently declared that France was unable to “take everyone in,” but that it was also struggling to “take them properly.”
Macron has been reportedly trying to find a compromise on immigration issues to mitigate the upcoming debate.
Recently, in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly during its general debate in New York, Macron said he hoped for a genuine “double-track” approach to immigration policy, seeking a balance between humanitarianism and efficiency.
Macron said, “If France wants to be able to accommodate (immigrants) properly, it cannot accommodate everyone.”
Macron outlined four priorities for immigration policy: granting asylum status as soon as possible to refugees in need of protection; promoting more efficient integration of immigrants; receiving and protecting all immigrants entering French territory; and relocating more efficiently those who are unsuitable for illegal entry into France.
Whether illegal immigrants should be protected by the State Medical Assistance (AME) system has been the most discussed topic in the past.
Macron said he hoped to be able to "assess" the system, but not to abolish it, but to limit it.
Following Macron’s statement, Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National League, speculated that Macron’s statement was “empty.”
A right-wing Republican member, Senate Speaker Lacher, also said immigration policy should be discussed in a "soft" but "realistic" manner, and indirectly criticized Macron.
Left Socialist MP François Wallois believes that France should “take more, better,” on the issue of immigration, and criticizes Macron for “manipulating” the issue.
The report noted that the new version of the Asylum and Immigration Act, which had been enacted for a year, had led to internal disagreements within the ruling party, but was not able to calm the right-wing opposition.
In the upcoming 2022 election, the topic of immigration policy will once again be the focus of attack on the far-right, and Macron will need to act on the issue, but at the same time risk provoking angry left-wing insiders in the ruling party.
It is reported that the French House of Commons will debate immigration policy from September 30 and the Senate from October 2.
There are signs that China’s A shares are experiencing a “buyback wave,” with many listed companies taking out “gold and silver” shares to buy back companies.
According to the statistics of financial data service provider Oriental Wealth, as of 27th of 2019, the total amount of repurchase of listed A-share companies exceeded 10 billion yuan (RMB, below), far exceeding the year-on-year figures, creating a record high in the amount of repurchase capital of A-shares.
Xu Yang, Chairman of the Shanghai Michael Young Information Advisory Co., Ltd., said that the overall valuation of the A stock market was lower this year, and that it was beneficial to buy back shares at a relatively lower price to improve the efficiency of the listed company's use of funds, as well as reflecting the willingness of the listed company to manage market value and the abundant cash flow situation, and to boost investor confidence.
Furthermore, the continuous improvement of the share buyback system has also encouraged the listed companies to actively carry out share buyback.
For example, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued rules for the implementation of share buybacks by listed companies, providing detailed rules and guidelines for share buybacks by listed companies.
In addition, according to media statistics, listed companies that have implemented plans to increase their takeovers have been concentrated mainly in the infrastructure, real estate, information technology and electronic equipment manufacturing sectors since this year.
Moreover, in terms of the amount of repurchase payments, six listed companies have repurchased more than 100 billion yuan this year.
Among them, the first was Eli shares, whose repurchase amounted to more than $50 billion.
What effect will the repurchase of listed companies have on the market?
On the other hand, the repurchase indicates that the listed companies and their holding shareholders are accountable to the company, to the market and to investors, according to Zhao Zhijun, deputy dean of the Faculty of Finance and Finance of the People's University of China, who spoke to Xinhua News Agency.
The former is based on the company's good operating performance, the latter requires listed companies and their holding shareholders to have a higher quality.
For capital markets, these are the most fundamental basic elements.
Repurchase of listed companies' shares is beneficial to boost investors' confidence and has a supporting effect on the stock prices of listed companies.
In addition, according to estimates by the Oriental Securities Institute, according to the total number of expected stock buybacks from listed A stock companies since the beginning of this year, and the average price of the stocks that have been bought back, this year's stock buybacks are expected to raise more than $15 billion for the A stock market.
For nearly two months, the restoration work of the large wall painting of Tianjin Temple's Sanctuary in Tianjin was announced on 26th and will be reopened during this year's National Day.
It is a large-scale traditional wall painting that fully reflects the life of the mother-in-law.
With the approval of the relevant departments of the State, the original Tianjin Civic Folklore Museum (Tengo Palace) was painted from 1991 to 1994.
It is known that the painting was painted on the walls of the southern and northern halls of the Imperial Palace, 32 meters long and 2.6 meters high, divided into two parts, with more than 30 stories, such as the birth and death of the Emperor, the passage of the sea, the feathering of the sky, etc., and 358 personal objects reproduced the life and death of the mother-in-law.
In recent years, Tianjin has had heavy rainfall in summer and dry in winter, which has led to cracks in the painting, which account for 60% of the painting's total area, Cai said.
In order to protect and rescue the murals of Mother-in-law's monuments, the Old Culture Street Authority of Nankai District, Tianjin City, and the Tenshu Palace initiated the restoration work of the Tenshu Palace's main palace and interior murals.
The restoration project was co-sponsored by Chai Chang Kei and invited four famous national painters to participate.
The restoration work is based on the principle of "repairing as old as old" and also adjusts the contents of the original wall paintings and supplements the restoration of areas where the wall paintings were not perfect.
In repairing, we also made innovations and experiments in colors, materials, pencils and so on.
After restoration, the original wall paintings were preserved in their style, spirituality, and artistic style.
It was built in 1326 and is one of the oldest buildings in the city of Tianjin, and one of the earliest mummy temples in China.
On 25 September, the launch ceremony at Beijing Daxiang International Airport was held.
The design of Beijing Taixing International Airport's terminal building, with the allegory of the Phoenix wings, has been hailed as the first of the "seven great miracles of the new world."
Currently, Beijing Capital International Airport is in a state of overloading, carrying more than 100 million passengers last year, becoming the second year in a row in the world to have more than a billion passengers at the airport after Atlanta.
By 2022, passenger traffic at Beijing’s Taixing International Airport is expected to reach 45 million, or 20% of international flights; by 2025, passenger traffic is expected to reach 72 million, or 30% of international flights.
As the " New State Gate, " how cool is it?
Beijing Daixian International Airport, located between Daixian District of Beijing and Guangyang District of Luofang City, Hebei Province, 46 km from Tiananmen Direct Line, is the world's largest new airport currently under construction.
The ground projection area of the steel roof structure of the station building reached 180,000 square meters, with 25 standard football fields of size.
Beijing Taixing International Airport is the world's first terminal building with two arrival and two departure levels – F1-F4 for international arrival, domestic arrival, domestic departure, and international departure.
The two-storey bridge connecting the high-speed terminal and the airport is located outside the terminal building, and corresponds to the terminal buildings F3 and F4, respectively, for international departures and domestic departures.
Beijing Taixing International Airport's first flight opened the era of Beijing's "double airport".
The new airport is positioned as a major international aviation hub, a new source of national impetus, and a comprehensive transport hub in the Xinjiang-Jiang region that supports the construction of the Yuan New Area. So far, 66 airlines have indicated their intention to enter Beijing's Taixing International Airport, including 20 domestic airlines, 46 airlines from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and foreign airlines.
During the 2019 winter and spring season, Beijing Taixing International Airport is expected to open 116 flights, including 101 domestic flights and 15 international flights; it covers 112 flights worldwide, including 97 domestic and 15 international flights.
This forms a coordinated development, moderate competition, and internationally competitive "dual hub" airport pattern with Beijing Capital International Airport, both relieves the capital airport capacity saturated operating pressure, and better meets the urgent need of rapid growth of air transportation in Beijing and surrounding areas, and effectively enhances the international competitiveness of China's civil aviation industry.
In order to ensure efficiency and quality, Beijing Taixing International Airport takes full account of the geographical location, the relationship between the airport and the surrounding airspace and the operating environment. For the first time in China, the airport runway has adopted a "toward-oriented" layout, adopted the world's largest air pipe automation system, and established China's largest terminal control area, which can maximize air operation efficiency.
Domestic airports of this size for the first time use domesticized luggage automatic processing and information management system, adopt innovative baggage transport mode, improve the efficiency of baggage system processing.
Beijing Taixing International Airport's first flight, predicts Phoenix's wing-flapping skyscraper.
The new airport, which has created more than 40 international and domestic firsts, with a domesticization rate of more than 98 percent, will have a direct and indirect economic impact on the industries of the surrounding areas and will inject vitality into Beijing's economic development.
Ma Hua tentatively convenes a general assembly in November to raise the age of the party to 16.
At the beginning of November, Mahua temporarily convened the Central Assembly of Representatives to amend the party's charter to bring the age of the party to 16.
With Congress adopting a reduction in the age of voting in the general election, Maw announced that the 66th Central Assembly would be convened this year to propose changes to the party chapter, including a reduction in Maw's party age from the current age of 18 to 16.
The meeting was scheduled for November 2 and 3 this year, but due to the re-election of the seats in the National Assembly of Denmark, the date of the meeting could be changed, said the Chairman of the Hong Kong Hong Kong Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HKCCI), Nao Guo Sly Wei Jiao.
He said that since the Election Commission would not meet until 1 October to determine the date and voting date for the re-election of the seats in Danube Province, they would meet the following day, 2 October, to discuss whether to change the date of this year's Central Assembly.
He also explained that the purpose of yesterday's (26th) meeting of the Central Committee was to determine the date of the General Assembly's representation and to amend the party's charter, but that it had just met with the unfortunate death of Nawab Mohammed Falli, a member of the National Assembly of the Indigenous Unity Party (UIDP), and thus joined the country's agenda for the re-election of seats.
"Shanghai County's Chief Executive Officers meet with the Chief Executive" (PDF).
Born in February 1943 in Shandong, Wang was a member of the Communist Party of China (CCP) and served as a secretary of the county council, mayor, etc. in 1967.
In 1986, Wang was appointed secretary of Shandong Province's Shuangqing County, which at that time was the poor county of Weifang.
During his five-year tenure, Wang focused his efforts on three things: firstly, promoting the industrialization of vegetables; secondly, developing a salt-and-salt beach in the north of Zhou; and thirdly, building the foundations of industry so that Zhou's pockets and waistbands could be lifted.
The farmers have a tradition of planting vegetables, and have also learned the lessons of planting vegetables.
At the beginning of the 1980s, the farmers could not sell their crops, and they were rotting in the ground.
Wang Beixiang's research found that the key to catching vegetables is to make good circulation.
Sumitomo took the lead in establishing the wholesale market of vegetables, opening the beginning of the development of market economy.
The head of state will take the lead, blow it up, all the losses in the county bear.
In 1989, with the support of Wang Beixiang, 17 members of the Zhu Village Party, including Wang Leiyi, established 17 large winter-warming vegetable shelters, and the village opened 17 "two million yuan households."
Afterwards, a promotional group was set up in the county, and under Wang Beixiang's mobilization, Wang Leiyi toured the townships and villages to give directions; in the first year, more than 5,000 vegetable shelters were promoted, and then the vegetable shelters spread like wildfire to the whole county and to the whole country.
For hundreds of years, 160,000 acres of land in the north of Suzhou has been covered by shallow beaches other than salt and alkali beaches.
The local people live a very hard life.
Yunnan has a large vegetable shelter. How about Yunnan?
Wang Beixiang organized tens of thousands of fighters, camped on the barren alkaline beach, forty-five days at a time.
Wang Beixiang and the county's leading leaders lived and worked on the grounds, pushing cars and trucks like civil servants, feasting and camping, and the people saw them stretching their thumbs and admiring them with their eyes ... ... At that time, Jubei developed 150,000 acres of shrimp ponds, 200,000 acres of salt fields, 60,000 acres of cotton fields, and developed a "poly pot" on the salt alkali beach.
In July 1986, Wang participated for the first time in the Weifang City Industry Conference as a secretary of the county council.
During the meeting, a "Comprehensive table of industrial economic figures for the twelve counties of Weifang City" was issued. At first glance, the GDP of the industry is good, ranked fourth.
But if the original salt is removed, the value of the pure industrial output remains only 1.19 billion yuan, placing it in third place.
Wang Bersheng, with more than 70 runners-up, ran out “for a change of mind.”
In less than a year, the county invested 1.5 billion yuan in 77 projects.
Since then, the group has been organized annually, traveling to Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Shanghai.
Life is short of enterprises, more entrepreneurs.
Wang Berxiang presided over the conference: in the whole county publicly selected managers, 40 "professional talented people" stand out and were pushed to the industry line.
In 1991, he was appointed as the deputy mayor of Weifang City by Wang Beixiang.
He left behind more than 20,000 large vegetable barns, 1.2 million acres of cotton fields, salt fields, shrimp ponds, 4854 enterprises, more than 100,000 “one million yuan households,” and a cadre team recognized by the people.
On September 26 at local time, Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi presided over the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and the Council's African member states at United Nations Headquarters in New York.
The meeting was attended by African current members of the Council, such as Foreign Minister Tano of Côte d'Ivoire, Foreign Minister Ojono of Equatorial Guinea, Foreign Minister Pandor of South Africa, and Foreign Ministers of the candidate member states, Nigeria, and Tunisia, Mr. Jacintawi.
Wang Yi made four recommendations on strengthening the cooperation between the two sides in the Council.
First, we must unite our forces.
The greatest challenge in the current international situation is unilateralism, the direct consequence of which is that the basic norms of international relations are challenged, the role of the United Nations is undermined, and the interests of the vast majority of developing countries and small and medium-sized countries, including those in Africa, are undermined.
To meet this challenge, it is necessary for Central Africa to hold hands shoulder-to-shoulder and solidarity to be strong.
At the Council, the three African countries spoke with one voice, and the focus was not just on three votes, but on the continent as a whole.
China and Africa stand together, not just for four votes, but to move other countries forward, influence and shape the agenda of the Council.
Since 2018, China has established a “3+1” coordination mechanism with the African members of the Council to make full use of this coordination mechanism.
Secondly, to settle disputes through consultation.
China has been advocating the political solution of hot issues, and Africa has a good tradition of consultations, as well as experience of successful good offices by African regional and subregional organizations.
Many of the complex problems on the agenda of the Council, particularly the hot spots in Africa, are largely rooted in colonialism, some directly related to external factors.
We should make good use of Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and of the role of the United Nations in good offices and mediation.
Thirdly, self-defense.
African countries and people know Africa best, and Africa has the ability and wisdom to solve its own problems.
In addressing Africa's hotspots, the Council should pay attention to listening to and respecting Africa's will, to playing the role of regional and subregional organizations, and to encouraging and supporting indigenous solutions from Africa.
China wishes to strengthen coordination with the non-African sides and resolutely promote the capacity building of African autonomous peace operations.
Fourth, development is fundamental.
China and the vast majority of African countries are developing countries, and we must insist on putting economic and social development first and support each other on their respective development paths.
China is willing to work closely with the AU Agenda for 2030, the United Nations Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030 and the development strategies of African countries to help African countries strengthen their development capabilities and eliminate the root causes of conflict.
We should jointly push the United Nations to increase its investment in Africa's development.
With the outbreak of Ebola in Congo (Kin), China has been and will continue to do its utmost to provide as much human and material assistance as possible, and is willing to coordinate operations with African countries, mobilize more assistance from the United Nations, WHO, etc., and play the role of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Congo (Kin).
Newborn babies, etc. are saving little lives.
Surprise!
A 32-week-old premature baby was born in the back of his father's car in a hurry on the way to the hospital.
Fortunately, the obstetrician and neonatal doctors took care of it in time and restored the little life.
Fortunately, on 19th, 20th and 21st, the maternity and neonatal departments of Hubei province's maternity and child health institutions visited three newborns born on the road for three consecutive days. The other two were born on 120 ambulances, and were 29 weeks old.
At 7am on September 19, she felt a little pain in her belly, thinking that she was 32 weeks pregnant, and that her first baby was premature. She packed up her pregnancy items and was ready to take a shower and go directly to the hospital.
After nine and a half o'clock, Ms. Cheng arranged for her husband to drive from Xu Dong's home to the hospital.
I didn't expect the baby to be born on his father's driver's seat as soon as the car leaves the house.
Twenty minutes later, Ms. Chen and her baby finally arrived at the maternity building of Hubei's maternity hospital.
The hospital's security officers saw the panic-stricken couple and the baby and immediately notified the maternity ward, where four doctors including the deputy doctor Zhang Huang and the midwife Liu Yan Yan Yan took the delivery bag and the umbilical cord plate and rushed downstairs.
“At that time, the mother was half lying on the back of the car, with sheep water and blood under her, and a baby boy next to her, with an umbilical cord.”
Zhang Huang inquired about the fact that the baby was a 32-week-old premature baby, and on the way the parents did not have to come and cover the package for the child, the early autumn morning had cooled down, he was frozen pale skin, no crying, and his limbs were paralyzed.
Liu Ying Ying hurried to the deputy driver to treat the baby's umbilical cord, Zhang Ying drilled in from the driver's room, quickly opened the delivery bag, wrapped the baby several layers with the therapeutic scarf and the delivery bag cloth, and cleaned the newborn's respiratory tract (as shown in the picture), then took the baby up to the 12th floor neonatal department.
When the nurses heard of the news, they immediately rushed to the nurse's station to rescue the premature baby.
At that time, the baby's face was purple and had an oxygen deficiency, and the doctor immediately made a tube for him, less than a minute, the baby recovered the heartbeat, and the skin's color was gradually restored red, and recovered successfully.
After being admitted to hospital, the 32-week-old baby was placed on an injured breathing machine, sustained rescue, breathing steady, and the next day was successfully withdrawn from the aircraft.
After a week of treatment, the baby's life condition is stable, breathing is clear, and it has begun to give a small amount of milk.
Fortunately, on 19th, 20th and 21st, the Department of Obstetrics and Neonatal Services received three newborns on the way for three consecutive days, two of whom were born in 120 ambulances, and two of whom were 29 weeks old.
In recent years, many babies born on the subway and in private cars have been admitted to provincial maternity clinics, which, if not handled properly, could threaten the safety of mothers and children.
The director reminded that pregnant mothers should come to the hospital immediately if they experience abdominal pain, water breakage, redness, etc.
In the event of a shower in the home or on the road, the mother should lie as flat as possible, put a blanket under her hips, etc., to prevent the baby from hitting the back of her head. The child should be warmed immediately after delivery and brought to the doctor as soon as possible.

A penalty is a maximum of three points?
The NBA Development League (NBAD) announced a new penalty rule on January 27, which stipulates that each penalty is played only once, and the score is determined by the offense.
O'Neill has a very low penalty shootout rate among NBA stars.
The new rules stipulate that a two-minute penalty shootout is allowed to earn two points, a three-minute penalty shootout is allowed to earn three points, and a one-minute penalty shootout is allowed.
The last two minutes of the regular time and extra time matches are played in accordance with the previous penalty rules.
Although the new season will only be a trial for the NBA Development League, fans are more concerned about the impact it would have on current players if it were introduced in the NBA.
At the moment, many people think the new rules may be in favor of "Big Beard" Harding, while the penalty shooter, James, who is not as good as he was, is to suffer.
Wuhan promotes intelligent restructuring of industrial enterprises with a maximum grant of 20,000 yuan
The city has been speeding up industrial intelligence reforms and implementing transition subsidies of up to 20,000 yuan since this year, reporters learned at a series of press conferences held by Wuhan City Hall's news agency on 27th.
So far, more than 800 large-scale industrial enterprises have collected information on the demand for intelligent restructuring.
Zhang Hong, deputy director of Wuhan Economic and Information Bureau, introduced that Wuhan has launched an action plan for intelligent restructuring of industrial enterprises since this year, providing free consultancy and diagnostic services to industrial enterprises on a demanding scale and proposing solutions to promote a new round of technological restructuring of high-level enterprises.
According to the plan, Wuhan City openly selects a number of professional diagnostic service institutions each year, through the opening of specialized columns, questionnaire surveys, and door-to-door forms, to conduct the demand survey for intelligent restructuring for all industrial enterprises of the city's larger scale.
So far, more than 800 regulated industrial enterprises have collected information on the demand for intelligent restructuring, accounting for nearly one-third of the city-scale industrial enterprises.
Five city-level diagnostic platforms have organized teams to be assigned to local enterprises to carry out "one-to-one" on-site assessment and program demonstration.
According to Zhang Hong, the city is currently organizing 373 intelligent restructuring projects, with a total investment of $297.6 billion. Hong Kong's first 5G intelligent production line in China, Motorola's leading intelligent cell phone production line in China, Wuhan's No Man's Digitalized Transformers Factory, the first wholesale satellite production line in China, the world's leading new type of veterinary pharmaceutical intelligent production line, and the European intelligent home Internet of Things (IoT) intelligent production line are among the industry's leading intelligent workshops and intelligent factories.
In addition, Wuhan City also increased financial support for intelligent restructuring projects.
These include investments in intelligent restructuring of industrial enterprises according to their actual completion; investments in equipment and hardware, and investments in R&D and software, including 8%, and transitional subsidies of up to $20 million.
At the same time, financial institutions such as the Joint Exchange and the Wuhan Branch of Zhejiang Commercial Bank of Wuhan have been actively engaged in providing personalized financial services aimed at the intelligent transformation of industrial enterprises.
Trudeau , who " collapsed, " will he succeed in re-establishing his office
This time, Trudeau stumbled out of a "big pit" that ran alongside him, and it was Trudeau himself who dug it a little.
Recently, the Canadian media has repeatedly exposed several old photos of current Prime Minister Trudeau, in which Trudeau disguises himself as a black man.
This is considered to be an obvious act of racial discrimination, which has sparked a sensational wave in Canada.
After the incident, Trudeau repeatedly apologized to the public.
However, Canadians do not buy bills.
Trudeau was a stone-lifter who broke his own foot.
As political commentator Larry and others have pointed out, since the rise of the “anti-black face movement” in the United States, Trudeau and the Federal Liberal Party have been vocally accusing opposition parties or dissidents within their own party of “great losses” in this regard, and have repeatedly praised the “immediate dismissal of anyone who commits this mistake.”
Simply put, this time it was Trudo who stumbled out of a “big pit” alongside his head, which he himself had dug a little bit.
Trudeau is the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, a young and handsome man who had a "political idol" cyclone when he left the country.
Originally a “politician,” he took the lead in the 2015 federal legislative elections in Canada after a surprisingly beautiful battle – where the Liberal Party gained half of the seats in the federal House of Representatives and a valuable single cabinet seat.
At the time, Trudeau presented many demagogic policies and ideas, such as “ethnic and gender equality,” “ecological conservation,” “economic revival,” and emphasizing the elimination of corruption and “the wind of injustice.”
For five years, however, he has been “going up and down” in almost all of these areas.
To take the issue of “racial and gender equality,” let alone the “black face,” in which he was “insensitive” to a series of indigenous issues that led to the removal of protest tents by indigenous groups and leaders to the front door of Parliament Hill on the 150th anniversary of Canada’s founding.
With regard to tackling corruption, Trudeau was involved in the booming Lan Lan Lanling affair earlier last year.
He was exposed to a serious misconduct and abuse by his hometown’s construction firm, Lan Wan Ling, and pressed the departments and officials responsible for prosecuting him to “raise his hand.”
Moreover, Trudeau was angry with the officials who disclosed the wrongdoing after the outbreak – the former Chief Prosecutor General of Canada, who was the first to disclose the wrongdoing, and who handled the case directly.
Although the case itself has doubts, its doubts are hard to brush.
Many observers pointed out that the five years of Trudeau's rule had collapsed, mainly because of his own "drilling" of the pit, and that the biggest "pit" was not more than the three "tails of the tiger, the tail of the snake, the self-eating of its fruit, and the "broadness of the lawful, the strictness of the lawful."
According to the most authoritative Canadian poll, Ankus-Reid, respondents in support of Trudeau have jumped from more than 60% to more than 30% since 2015, while opponents have jumped from less than 30% to more than 60%.
Even though other opposition parties and their leaders have performed equally poorly, even a significant proportion of voters who still want to vote for the Federal Liberal Party are now dismayed by the federal prime minister and leader of the ruling party.
Will Trudeau be able to return to the game he won five years ago when a new Canadian federal legislative election began on October 21st?
The answer may be one word: difficult.
Whether from the level of enterprise competition, the level of consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration, the development integration of Jiangsu-Jiang, it has a profound impact and positive significance.
On 25 September, Beijing Taixing International Airport was officially opened.
The New York Times reported to the Beijing Development Commission that the capital airport is in an ultra-saturated state of operation, and the opening of Taixing International Airport will increase the capacity of the capital's air services.
After Shanghai, Beijing became the second city in China to have two airports, and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport mainly serves domestic air services, and Pudong Airport mainly serves international air transportation, similar to the future Capital Airport and Taixing Airport will also provide more detailed services to serve different domestic and international air services.
From the point of view of business development, the airport has a more beneficial effect on the capital.
The airport's capacity exceeded 100 million passengers in 2018, making it the nation's largest airport, but there is still a significant deficiency in capacity compared to the rapidly growing operational demand, especially for international flights.
In order to better serve domestic and foreign passenger tourism, business trips, and so on, and to adapt to Beijing's increasingly open and internationally accessible urban development trends, Taixing International Airport is positioned as a major international hub airport, and plans to meet annual passenger traffic of 100 million people and freight and mail traffic of 400 million tons in the future.
Therefore, the two airport locations do not overlap, respectively targeting different customer groups, also have enough market space.
From the economic point of view, the operation of Taixing International Airport will clearly create a double-win effect, alleviate Beijing air traffic tensions, accelerate the growth rate of passenger and cargo intake, and create a double-core increase cake of the capital's airline operation.
From the user's point of view, with the arrival of Taixing International Airport, the future does not need to concentrate on traveling to the capital airport, but also reduces the series of problems caused by over-concentration of the route, such as the lengthening of the stopover guarantee time, the slowing of the passenger's boarding speed, the indirect increase of aircraft and passengers staying at the airport, the increase of the airport running burden, and the reduction of the load through the capital airport, in fact also improved passengers' travel experience.
According to the media's calculations of the time and cost of various transport routes to large international airports, for example, from the South Five Circle to go to Beijing to the high-speed directly up to Taixing Airport high-speed, it can be reached in 50 minutes by car, the oil money returns about 40 yuan, the high-speed cost 15 yuan; and choose the Railway Railway Taixing Airport Line, the route is limited to 20 kilometers, 30 kilometers, the ticket price is divided into 10 yuan, 25 yuan, 35 yuan three-way; citizens can also ride between Beijing Xi station to Taixing Airport station in just over 20 minutes.
Overall, there are a variety of transportation options for the citizens to Daxing Airport, and the cost and time are within a reasonable range.
And from the point of view of trend development: The location of Taixing Airport is the transportation hub of Kyushu and Jiangxi, so the distance from Beijing area is a bit distant, but it strengthens the radiation to Hebei and Tianjin, it facilitates more people travel, and it is important to attract the economic development of Hebei and Tianjin.
In the future, passengers from Hebei and Tianjin will be able to enjoy more international airline services provided by Taixing International Airport, which can be seen in the traffic planning of Taixing Airport.
The airport's transportation facilities are very good, in addition to the Beijing area directly to the new airport line, there are several highways connecting the airport with the surrounding area.
Just as passengers in cities such as Guangdong, Foshan, and Qingdao can travel to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport via highways such as Guangdong, Guangdong and Guangdong, residents of Beijing's neighbouring corridors and Yuan New Area will also benefit from Daxiang Airport and get convenient and efficient air services.
Thus, it can be seen that the operation of Taixing International Airport, not only increases a few runways and a few aircraft, whether from the level of enterprise competition, consumer experience, or from the level of regional aviation integration and the development integration of Beijing Jiangxi, has a far-reaching impact and positive significance, not only concerning the long-term layout and development of Beijing shipping industry, to provide a variety of travel options for the large number of residents of Beijing Jiangxi Jiangxi, to promote further improvement of the quality of services of Beijing shipping industry, more conducive to the development process of the integration of Beijing Jiangxi Jiangxi, and to attract the economic and trade development of the area around Taixing Airport.
Thus, for the operation of Daxiang Airport, we need to account economically not only for the small accounts of individuals, but also for the big accounts of the overall development.

2019 Vietnam Forum on Economic and Social Issues held in Chengdu
At the beginning of this year, Vietnam's economic and social development showed many new developments and continued to grow, Vietnam's Deputy Chairman of the Economic Committee of the National Diet, Mr. Nguyen Deng, said.
The forum focused on the economic and social issues highlighted in the months prior to 2019 and proposed measures for economic and social development at the end of 2019 and 2020.
At the Forum, representatives exchanged in-depth views and views on four themes: the economic situation in 2019 and the impact of some of the FTAs, some outstanding issues in Vietnam's economy in 2019, outstanding issues in Vietnam's social culture in 2019, and forecasts and recommendations for Vietnam's economic and social development in 2020.
Representatives generally believed that global economic growth slowed in the first few months of 2019, and risks and challenges increased.
The trade friction between the major economies has further weakened global trade and investment.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has concluded that, despite the global economy’s uncertainty, with 70% of the world’s economies experiencing stagnation in growth, Vietnam’s economic development has achieved many commendable results, with macroeconomic stability and effective control of inflation, and an average growth of 2.64 per cent in the first half of 2019, the lowest in nearly three years.
In the first half of 2019, GDP grew by 6.76 per cent, down from 7.05 per cent in the same period last year, but still higher than the same period in 2011-2017.
Deng Deng, deputy director of the Vietnam National Economic and Social Forecasting Centre, said that Vietnam's economy was showing higher growth in 2019 against the background of global economic turmoil.
It is expected that by 2020, Vietnam's macroeconomic situation will remain essentially stable, and the implementation of the various FTAs will contribute to trade development, economic structural adjustment and improvement of the business environment will be further strengthened, and Vietnam's external export activity will decline due to trade frictions.
Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and early warning mechanisms, to actively seek trade relief measures for Vietnamese exports, to seek opportunities to expand new export markets and to facilitate foreign exports of various commodities such as agricultural water products.
At the same time, the inflation rate should be controlled at a reasonable level, thereby promoting the development of auxiliary industries, supporting the development of high-tech agriculture, organic agriculture and ecological agriculture, etc.
The Director of the Consulate-General's Office at the Embassy of China in Cambodia in Siam, Liu Zhi-jee, held a reception in Siam on 26th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
Mr. Liu said that over the 70 years since the founding of the new China, China has been actively involved in international affairs, contributed more to improving global economic governance and promoting global common development, contributed more to China's intelligence and China's programmes, made important contributions to world peace and development, and brought tangible benefits to Cambodia's economic development and the well-being of its people.
As the world's second-largest economy, China contributes more than 30% to global economic growth, Mr Liu said, notably through China's Belt and Road Initiative and the growing cooperation between China's provincial cities and Siam and territorial provinces.
He said this year marks the opening of 61 years of bilateral relations between China and Cambodia. The two countries have brotherly friendships and mutually beneficial cooperation will be the driving force of local economic and social development.
The Governor of Siam province, Mr. Di Saiha, highly praised the great achievements of New China over the past 70 years and congratulated the achievements of friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia.
The delegation hopes that both sides will continue to work together to promote the friendship and cooperation between China and Cambodia, strengthen mutual trust and mutual benefit, and improve the living standards of the people.
The Siam-Guangxi Agricultural Demonstration Park, the Siam-Guangxi New International Airport Project, the Siam-Guangxi Provincial Government Special Training Course, Siam students studying abroad scholarships, rural clinics, urban road rehabilitation, and the "Light Walk" public-interest project for the rehabilitation of blindness in Siam-Guangxi have been the direct beneficiaries of the friendly cooperation between China and Siam.
The meeting was attended by the Secretary of State for the Cambodian Ministry of Defence, Mr Ken文松, the Chairman of the Siam Provincial Council, Mr Wong Tsing, the Governor of the Fifth District, the Siam Council of the Cambodian People's Republic of China, volunteer teachers, the Siam Council of the Cambodian Chinese Chamber of Commerce, representatives of Chinese companies and representatives of foreign missions in Siam.
"The New Year's Eve in China" (PDF).
If the 2009 local website forum were to be the starting point, a full decade has passed since the 2019 Yunsu Conference, held on 25-27 in Hangzhou.
From the concept of "cloud in the fog" to the practice of "cloud up," big data and cloud computing has become one of the core technologies supporting China's economic development, social management, and public services for 10 years.
A new “colleague” with Ali Yun’s artificial intelligence has recently been placed next to the inspector at the Zhejiang-Heinning-based Zhejiang-based Zhongtai new-generation photovoltaic battery workshop.
It is 24 hours non-stop, the identification speed is more than twice as fast as artificial, and the quality control accuracy is stable at more than 95%.
According to the company's chief executive, the camera-carrying "quality inspector" has concentrated on studying more than 40,000 defective samples and is able to quickly convert infrared images into binary languages using cloud computing to classify defective batteries.
The company is just a snippet of what cloud computing is doing today to help manufacturing transition.
In 2018, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the Guidelines for Promoting Enterprise Cloud Implementation (2018-2020), proposing that by 2020, efforts should be made to achieve a significant increase in enterprise cloud awareness and enthusiasm, as well as a significant increase in the proportion and depth of enterprise cloud applications.
Wang Qian, founder of Ali Yun, said that today, data-centric cloud computing has paved the way for a digital economy where data is a key element.
At the same time, over the last decade, the scale of cloud computing industry in China has also been expanding.
According to the White Paper on Cloud Computing Development (2019), published by the China Institute of Information and Communications in July this year, China’s cloud computing market totaled $962.8 billion in 2018, up 39.2% from 2017.
In addition to becoming the key technology to support industrial transformation and digital economic development, the invisible clouds have unconsciously changed urban management and social life.
At this year's Yunsu Congress, the "city brain" that has been on display for three consecutive years is still a cause for concern.
According to Ali Yun, the city brain has become the center of city management from traffic management tools, and the related cooperation applications have been extended to 23 cities worldwide.
The city's brain, through sensory perception, artificial intelligence algorithms, and powerful computing capabilities, is able to implement new city management services such as "paying for parking before you park," "real-time perception of the number of visits," and "touring route design."
In the area of administrative services, using "one cloud" to "one thing," the "hand on office" and "hand on business" to promote together, cloud computing brings convenience to both ends of the supply of administrative services.
At present, Zhejiang province has built a unified public data platform through the administration cloud.
As of September 11, the platform has covered the province's more than 57 million inhabitants and 15 million legal entities, collecting 190.8 billion data in the 3066 category of governance.
On average, Zhejiang province’s government departments have used and shared data up to 12 million times a month, and the data flows on clouds more than once, which may mean that the public does little.
Be careful to use plastic tea bags to make tea!
A recent Canadian study found that a packet of plastic tea bags could release billions or even hundreds of billions of plastic particles, significantly higher than one person's estimated annual consumption of micro-plastics, but so far there is no evidence that consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans, according to CBC.
Researchers at the University of Magill, Canada, reportedly found that when they immersed the plastic tea bag in a glass of almost boiling hot water (95 degrees Celsius), it released about 116 billion plastic particles and 31 billion smaller nano-plastic particles into the glass.
This amount is significantly higher than one person's estimated annual intake of microplastics.
According to a study published earlier in 2019, the average person eats at least 50,000 pieces of plastic every year, while absorbing the same amount of plastic.
The study was published in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology. The researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial tea bags in Montelu and coffee shops, opened them, cleaned them and immersed them in nearly boiling water for five minutes, then analyzed them with electron microscopes and spectrometers.
According to the study, they found that a single tea bag releases more than 116 billion plastic particles, “a number of orders of magnitude higher than previous plastic loads on other foods.”
Most tea bags are reportedly made of natural fiber, but many brands that make tea bags out of natural fiber still use plastic to seal their mouths.
Some branded tea bags are no longer paper-based, but plastic, and these plastic tea bags are the subjects of research.
Plastic particles are tiny fragments of plastic, defined by researchers to be between 100 nanometers and 5 microns in size, and are produced mainly by the decomposition of plastic garbage.
Researchers have found traces of plastic particles in air, soil, rivers, and deepest seas around the world, as well as in freshwater, bottled water, seafood, and beer.
In October 2018, researchers first discovered plastic particles in human feces samples from several countries in different regions of the world.
To test the potential toxicity of plastic particles released from tea bags, a Canadian research team put fleas in contaminated water and found that micro-plastics could affect fleas' behavior and cause them to develop deformities.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that consumption of plastic particles poses a threat to humans.
However, WHO points out that more research is needed to fully understand how these plastics spread into the environment and what impact they have on humans.
Researchers have speculated that the reason for the release of large quantities of plastic particles is that they may be in contact with boiling water, and that even "food grade" plastics can decompose or leak poisonous substances when heated to more than 40 degrees Celsius.
Mr Guterres said the climate emergency was the greatest threat to the survival of small island countries.
There, a natural disaster will erode the developmental achievements of a generation.
This is illustrated by the hurricane-hit areas of Barbados, Dominica and the Bahamas since this year.
About one quarter of people in small island developing States live at an altitude of 5 metres or below.
Relocations may have a serious impact on their societies and lifestyles, and may even raise sovereignty and ethnic identity issues.
At this Monday’s Climate Action Summit, small island nations jointly committed to achieving carbon and 100% renewable energy by 2030, thereby once again leading the world in the right direction.
“The climate crisis is stacking new injustice on old injustice,” Guterres said.
Although small island developing countries make a small contribution to global warming, they pay the highest price.
Due to their middle-income status, many countries are still trapped in an accelerated and unsustainable cycle of catastrophe and debt.
The world must act, and it is time to make major decisions and invest heavily in small island developing countries.”
Today's high-level meeting adopted a political declaration calling for ways to help small island developing States manage disaster risks, invest in climate-adaptive infrastructure and transition to renewable energy; and urged international agencies to help small island developing States, especially middle-income countries with indebtedness, to obtain funding.
Small island developing countries are at the forefront of protecting and preserving the Earth’s lifeline – the oceans.
The latest special report released this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the oceans have suffered the severe consequences of the “invading” climate crisis.
By the middle of this century, many regions may have had some extreme sea level rise every year, which had occurred only once in a century.
The report warned that in the absence of substantial investment in adaptation, some island countries were likely to become uninhabited.
Pollution, overfishing and acidification have caused huge losses.
In the past 150 years, half of all living corals have been lost in the world, and plastic pollution has increased tenfold in the last 40 years.
The demands of industry, shipping, mining and tourism are causing scarcity of resources, including the maintenance of fisheries in many island communities.
Small island countries also face high costs in terms of transport, energy and infrastructure.
They are heavily dependent on some external markets to be influenced by price fluctuations.
Some countries are also working to address the security implications of illicit trafficking in populations, weapons and drugs.
“The problem can be solved anywhere by solving a problem in the most challenging environment,” Guterres said.
The efforts of small island developing States to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will provide us with tools, lessons learned, and examples to draw from around the world.”
He emphasized that small island developing States were a special example of sustainable development.
They require the long-term attention and investment of the entire international community.
The finance ministry of India says the financial system is sufficiently liquid.
India's economic growth is expected to recover in the second half of this fiscal year, as the financial system is currently liquid enough to drive demand for holiday consumption, Finance Minister Sitarman said on 26 May.
The statement was made after meeting with representatives of Indian private banks, non-bank financial institutions and housing banks.
Shitalaman did not explain the specificity of these statements.
Previously, some Indian and overseas media blamed the continued slowdown of the Indian economy on liquidity tensions in non-bank financial institutions.
Citalaman, for example, denies that liquidity tensions are the main cause of the decline in car sales.
The decline in car sales was mainly due to cyclical factors, Sitaraman noted.
The growth of India's economy is expected to recover in the next half of the fiscal year, citing holiday consumption.
India's annual shopping season begins in September and lasts until the end of the year.
Markets expect that shopping and consumption will greatly boost India's economic growth.
The Ministry of Education of Jiangxi province has recently issued a notice that it will strictly prohibit secondary schools in the province from supplementing classes in violation of the National Day holiday, and will conduct random inspections and interrogations of the organizers.
In the following Notice on the Prohibition of Unlawful Completion of Classes during National Day Holidays, the Ministry of Education of Jiangxi Province stressed that all primary and secondary schools in all parts of the country should make a firm commitment to do so during the National Day: no group remedial classes or new classes should be organized, no subject-specific training courses, special long-term classes, Olympic classes, interest classes, enhancement classes, etc. should be organized, and no campuses or school premises should be leased to other educational institutions for various training courses.
At the same time, it is strictly prohibited to organize, recommend and induce students to participate in irregular supplementary classes both inside and outside the school, it is strictly prohibited to participate in irregular supplementary classes organized by other teachers, parents, parents' committees, etc., and it is strictly prohibited to introduce the source of life and provide relevant information to external training institutions and others.
Notice is made explicit that the education administrative departments at the local level will be subjected to additional deductions in the assessment of education by the county-level government in the same year for violations in the correction of the corrections in the elementary schools; the teachers involved in the violations in the correction of the corrections will be treated seriously in accordance with the relevant provisions of teacher ethics.
Supporting live pig production and securing market supply
Sui's loyalty demands that measures be implemented in six areas
The Telephone Conference of the Province to Promote the Supply of Guaranteed Market for Pork Production was held today to re-engage and re-deploy the central and provincial governments in implementing the policy measures to support the supply of guaranteed market for pork production.
Sui's loyalty demanded that all measures for the production of live pigs be implemented in six ways.
The mayor is responsible for the implementation of the "garden basket", and this year the province's clear task of 45 million pigs out of the fence has been decomposed into the municipalities and provinces, and incorporated into the system of responsibility assessment.
Taking all the policy measures and implementing them, practically solve the problem of implementing the "last kilometer" of the policy.
We will take care of the implementation of the production of breeding pigs, implement the good breeding pig subsidies policy seriously, encourage breeding pig enterprises to expand the breeding scale of breeding pigs, and systematically select good breeding pigs from commodity pig populations.
Taking care of the implementation of attracting and attracting investment, consider the domestic well-known large-scale breeding enterprises that have not yet entered the province as the main focus of attracting and attracting investment.
We will implement the market distribution system and accelerate the construction of cold chain distribution facilities for live pigs. We will promote the transition from "moving pigs" to "moving meat."
In order to implement the modern epidemic control system, we need to equip the basic epidemic control personnel who are adapted to the scale of cultivation and tasks, and establish the first line of epidemic control.
Sui's loyalty demands that all efforts be made to ensure the supply of meat in the market, to ensure that there is no massive shortage or large-scale supply disruption, and to ensure that the supply of pig meat in the major holiday market is stable.
The meeting also deployed work on the continuation of the prevention and control of swine plague in Africa, the banning and withdrawal of fishing in important waters of the Yangtze River basin and the acquisition of rice in central and western provinces.
Speaking of the Motherland and the Soul of the Nation The Great White Rabbit and other representatives of the old Chinese characters in Shanghai attended party classes for college students
"I and My Motherland" is a campus card to make college students "not happy" about Shu.
On the occasion of celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, four famous Shanghai characters such as Soap, Shao Wan, Big White Rabbit, and Red Rabbit were gathered for the 27th "Art Party Class" at the East China Polytechnic University.
On the spot, the old word brand products are displayed at the exhibition.
In the classroom, students were stunned by the story, and outside the classroom, there were elaborate displays of branded products, as well as "I and My Motherland" campus cards for seniors to enjoy.
Great white rabbit lip lotion, Great white rabbit ice cream As an old word brand, Great white rabbit milk sugar has been actively seeking change in recent years, actively attacking, insisting on innovation and cross-border.
Born in 1959, the big white rabbit is celebrating its 60th birthday this year.
Shao Wan Zhou will also turn his attention to young consumers.
Wang Wei-jee, party secretary and deputy general manager of Shao Wan Food Co., Ltd. in Shanghai, referred to the scenes in which "the spring bloomed with fish, the summer heat with bad fish, the autumn wind with shrimp drunk, and the winter clouds with crabs drunk," reflecting people's constant innovation in "eating".
The company also further explores brand culture from flavor innovation, cartoon packaging design and so on to adapt to the inheritance of the younger generation consumer group.
The old word represents the way of innovation in the "Art Party Class" on the spot.
" All innovations can't be built on solid foundations. Every innovation is a thick and thin process.
Everybody has hidden in their hearts the expectation of the old characters.
A product-centric, small and beautiful age should begin.”
As one of the first batches of "Chinese Old Words" in the country, Shanghai has come and quickly adapted to the market trend, to the brand VI visual upgrade, introduced a professional operating team, and achieved a significant increase in turnover.
"Old characters are not only seen in traditional channels such as supermarkets, but are now actively involved in new retail and other activities.
All of our changes ultimately aim to enable consumers to see, hear, and buy.”
The vice general manager of Shanghai Soap Manufacturing (Group) Co., Ltd., Oyang said.
In the future, Shanghai soap manufacturers will also stick to high-end development, system development prospects are wide, consumers are satisfied with energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, stick to high-tech content and high economic efficiency road.
Through this art party lesson, the students have gained a lot.
The old characters accompanied my growth and carried good memories and emotions as a child.”
Sung Xiangyuan's classmates sighed.
The representative of Shanghai Old Character told more than 200 young students about the motherland and national soul of the brand of Old Character.
As a design student, we need to think and explore the question of how to excavate the brand culture, how to inherit high-quality traditional culture from generation to generation.
The course is based on the "Shanghai Video" project of the Dean of the Institute of Arts of the University of Technology, Dongguan, China, and the "Shanghai Brand Innovation Studio" of Professor Nijun, hoping to deeply explore the cultural potential and modern commercial value of the old Chinese characters, to use the competitiveness and influence of the old Chinese characters in Shanghai, to strengthen the cultural radiation power of the Shanghai Chinese characters, to realize the "1+1>2" industrial effect in the form of "Design + Culture" and to show Shanghai culture from a new perspective.

Shinzo Abe's video celebrates the 70th anniversary of the founding of New China and speaks Chinese
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by video.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: Good evening, I am Shinzo Abe.
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I would like to offer warm congratulations on behalf of the Government and people of Japan.
At the G20 Osaka Summit in June, Japan and China worked together to make the summit a success, and through the G20 Leaders’ Osaka Summit Declaration, they declared the G20’s unwavering will to the world.
In addition, the two sides agreed at the summit's pre-summit summit meetings and dinners that President Xi Jinping would visit Japan next spring, while agreeing to open a new era for Japan and China.
Japan and China share a great responsibility for peace and prosperity in Asia and the world.
I firmly believe that working together to tackle the challenges facing the region and the world and contributing to the international community together will be beneficial in building a new model of future relations between the two countries.
Finally, I wish the relations between Japan and China to flourish and the careers of my friends to flourish.
"It is estimated that over half of the over-age peasants on some farms are women.
Where are you looking for young workers now?
There is no way to use so many 'old people' in the workplace."
Recently, Zou Qiu, a long-time contractor in the construction industry, complained about the phenomenon of many over-age farmers (over retirement age) on the work ground.
Recently, the author's university has carried out rain sewage separation project, there are many peasants on campus, if you pay attention, you will find that there are many over-age peasants.
Overage peasants who go out to work are not “uninterrupted,” but because they are “uninterrupted,” with the helplessness and hardship of having to do so – whether to save money to solve their own pension and medical problems or to help their children – drive those old people who should have been “uninterrupted” to continue working hard.
The “faithfulness” of over-age farmers is not as easy as we might imagine.
Growing children, supporting the elderly, helping children to read, helping children to build houses, buy cars, helping children to start a family business, and raising their grandchildren in separate generations, when these peasants have accomplished their “life’s tasks,” their pockets have been empty, and there is even a lot of debt, and most of them lack wealth accumulation.
In order not to burden their children or accumulate more wealth for themselves, many farmers insist on “doing until you can’t do it.”
Many of the “80s,” “90s,” and even “00s” new-generation peasants are reluctant to engage in hard-working, labor-intensive secondary industries or low-end services, resulting in structural “use-of-the-job scarcity.”
Due to the lack of a single skill, physical fitness and labor capacity are also declining, and many over-age peasants work with high intensity, low income, high risk, and few guaranteed jobs.
Working for a day is one thing, earning more for a day is one thing, and the plight of the over-age peasants behind "not to be lazy" cannot be ignored or ignored.
Resolving the problems of pay arrears and pay bargaining, improving labor protection, reducing safety risks, increasing labor incomes, and improving the survival status of overage peasants, besides their “self-saving,” cannot be separated from public-sector institutional protection and humanitarian care.
Some scholars have pointed out that overage farmers are less likely to rely on home-grown land to cope with their pensions and medical problems, and that they must make a living through other means.
Reading about the helplessness and strength of the over-age peasants who "can't rest" helps us better understand the love and pain of the over-age peasants.
Seeing the backdrop of over-age farmers, hearing their sighs, and thinking about how to get them back to the countryside to realise their “reliance on old age,” requires the public sector, markets, and society to share responsibilities in positive interactions and multilateralism.
Chemezov said Russia would not export such a system in the next five years, because it would “supply its own army first, and then export production.”
This is entirely in line with international practice.
The major producers of arms and military equipment always ensure their own defence needs first and then deal with export orders.
Earlier, General Yuri Glehov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Air Force, said that the development of the system was about to be completed.
The S-500 system was developed by King Kong-Antai Air Defense Company.
This is a new generation of anti-aircraft system which adopts the working principles for destroying ballistic and aerodynamic targets.
The main role of the S-500 is to intercept medium-range ballistic missiles capable of intercepting missiles with a range of less than 3,500 km.
Furthermore, according to some sources, the S-500 could also destroy high-speed ultrasonic cruise missiles and aircraft, almost all types of unmanned aircraft, ultrasonic missiles over five times the speed of sound, and even near-space targets.
The weapon can also be integrated into a unified network with other air defense systems, especially the S-400 system, which is very important from a defence point of view.
Sergei Chemezov expressed particular concern about the S-400.
He said the system is currently in great demand in the world, but the Russian army also needs it, including in the Arctic.
The S-400 anti-aircraft system entered the Arctic Air Force.
According to the news on September 15, work on the redesign of the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system by the New Zealand Arctic Air Force has been completed.
This is not Russia’s militarization of the Arctic.
The Russian Ministry of Defence says this is entirely part of a plan to move towards a more advanced defence tool in the northern strategic direction.
“With the transition to the new S-400 anti-aircraft system, the controlled airspace in the Arctic region is significantly expanding,” the Northern Fleet news agency said.
It is very important that, according to military assessments, the system has been successfully used in the Arctic and the Arctic regions.
Air Force officers have been trained for the new system and prepared to enter the combat task force.
Previously equipped with the S-300 long-range anti-aircraft system, part of it is still retained.
When it comes to air defense systems, they must have weapons capable of destroying all kinds of aerial targets, be they high-altitude high-altitude flying targets or nearby “liquid nets” of protected facilities.
According to public sources, the S-400 Triumph system, developed by Gold Diamond-Antai Air Defense Cousins, was designed to attack strategic and tactical aircraft, ballistic missiles, high-velocity targets and other air-attack weapons.
The weapon can attack aerodynamic targets within 400 kilometres of range and hit ballistic targets flying at 4.8 kilometres per second within 60 kilometres.
Russia has never concealed that it will reinforce its air defence forces in the polar region to ensure the territorial air safety of the northern sea routes.
Not long ago, the first 12 sets of Tor-M2DT anti-aircraft missile systems were delivered to the Russian Arctic, sufficient to form an anti-aircraft battalion to strengthen the Arctic's anti-aircraft system.
At the time, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that the Arctic "Tor" force would be expanded to a full brigade-level structure in the future.
In addition to the newly deployed S-400 long-range systems on New Zealand and the Kola Peninsula, and the short-range "Pantsir-SA" systems deployed in the North Pole, these advanced anti-aircraft weapons effectively guard Russia's polar skies.
Enemy aircraft, helicopters and drone missiles will find it difficult to break through this defense.
According to the Russian government, flagship stores would be a platform for Russian manufacturers to place their products and avoid the complicated and lengthy process of opening their own.
As the operator of Russian merchandise stores, the company focuses on selling Russian goods in China.
China's largest trading platforms, including Tmall, JD, 1688, Pinduoduo, ShouQ, and multi-functional instant messaging software Weichat, have online stores and own their own online platform, Epinduo.com, and Russian retail chains.
The Russian Export Centre will work with the Russian Syndicate to develop marketing strategies and participation standards for stores, and to screen virtual warehouses for products.
The stores plan to open and sell at least ten Russian manufacturers' products by the end of this year.
According to Russian export center data, the total monthly visits to the Chinese electronics platform amounted to one billion.
Meanwhile, food exports to China have grown steadily since 2014, reaching more than $1 billion in 2018.
At present, Alibaba Group will also open a pilot store to sell goods from New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore within the framework of its global import strategy.
According to Alexei Kogevnikov, the new store will display products with sales of at least 500 million rubles or more.
To tell you the truth, my expectations are higher and the sales of 500 million rupees are still insufficient.
As we all know, Chinese consumers are quite positive about Russian goods and regard our products as high quality and environmentally friendly.
The competition for Chinese consumers with strong purchasing power is fierce and is intensifying, Kogevnikov said.
“Our goal is ambitious,” he said, “to launch 500 businesses through this store in three years.”
At the same time, the platform will also launch products of Russian enterprises in the Far East.
"This is a political project that represents the image of both sides," said Vyacheslav Cheglov, professor of the Department of Trade Policy at the University of Economics in Plymouth, Russia.
“I haven’t seen a lot of highly competitive Russian goods in the market.”
He believes that the project is unlikely to be truly implemented, but that it will help strengthen relations between the two countries.
More than 170 Russian enterprises' product information has been published on the largest international wholesale online platform, Alibaba.com, which can be purchased in China or other countries, Andrey Slepnev, president of the Russian Export Centre, said during the Eastern Economic Forum, according to Russian News Agency.
In addition, there is another model of cooperation with Alibaba Group, namely a training project for Russian enterprises by experts from Taobao University, whose first seminar was held in July this year.
The Russian Export Centre at the second China International Import Expo in Shanghai this November will also be the organizer of trade exhibitions and business projects for Russian enterprises.
There will be a large exhibition in the exhibition hall of 1,000 square meters, which will also be the center of business project activities, signing ceremony, introduction meetings and talks with Chinese business representatives.
Approximately 50 applications have been received from Russian agricultural enterprises.
"In addition to the agricultural exhibition stand, we will also hold business meetings to arrange direct contacts between entrepreneurs," said the Russian Export Centre news agency.
“This is another direction of our efforts, aimed at supporting businesses and ensuring that dozens of special meetings are arranged for them.”
In addition, the exhibition will also host master classes, cooking competitions and Russian-American food tastings of Russian chefs from the "Shanghai Station for Exploring Russian Cuisine" project.
Following Friday's decision by the Mohammad Adi Trial Chamber to convict the dead of non-accidental manslaughter, police await a full report and instructions from the General Prosecutor's Office to take the next steps.
The National Police Criminal Investigation Bureau, named after Governor Huzl, issued a statement Friday that police would await the Supreme Prosecutor's Office's further instructions, based on the verdict of the body.
In his statement, he stressed that the police had never terminated the investigation into the death of Mohammed and that the investigation was still under way.
On the other hand, Chief Sheriff Noah O'Connor said the police would wait for a full report on the contents of the verdict before taking action.
This is how he responded to an inquiry into the matter when he attended a ceremony to hand over the powers of Deputy Chief of Police at the Sherwood Police Headquarters on Friday morning.
He said the police investigated the case on the basis of reports.
He added that the police would also monitor the progress of the investigation and decide whether or not to call again those who had previously been interviewed.
The Beijing Garden Greening Bureau has learned that, for the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Xinjiang New China, Beijing has recently adopted Chang'an Street and its alongside as its main axis to improve the landscape of garden greening and create an atmosphere of peace and celebration.
At present, 12 three-dimensional altars along Chang'an Street have all been completed and the city's 2 million pots of flowers dressed up as the capital, dressed up to welcome National Day.
Throughout the day, the twelve gorgeous and diversely shaped three-dimensional altar landscapes along Chang'an Street attracted many tourists to view and take photographs.
The themes of these altarpieces, starting with the "sweet 70 years" of the northwest corner of the State Gate and ending with the "good tomorrow" of the northeast corner of the Revival Gate, embellish the glorious achievements made in various fields during the 70 years of the founding of the New China and show the happy life of the people.
The head of the Beijing Garden Greening Bureau introduced that this year's greening environment layout made full use of its own innovative achievements and integrated new varieties and new technologies at home and abroad.
Over 230 varieties, including 16 self-cultivated varieties, 18 new green resistant varieties and 11 rural plants, were applied in the altar.
The three chrysanthemum varieties of our country's self-selective breeding of "cold sun shining", "flowery candy" and "flowery" were applied for the first time.
In order to celebrate National Day, Beijing has recently undertaken a comprehensive remediation of the city's landscape landscaped gardens, replanting more than 120,000 trees, 230,000 shrubs, and 230,000 square meters of grass roots flowers.
At the same time, in important areas such as the city's ring roads, Chang'an Street Extended Line, Shanshan Memorial Site, the vicinity of the new airport and the vicinity of important tourist attractions, 200 theme altars have been set up with the use of up to 20 million pots of flowers, 10,000 flower pillars, 5,000 containers, and 150,000 flower boxes.

E-smoking in the United States has killed 12 people and resulted in 805 lung injuries.
Twelve people have died from electronic tobacco-related diseases in the United States, and 805 have suffered lung damage related to smoking, U.S. health officials said on Sunday, local time, according to the Central Bureau of Health.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly reported these figures and said that specific substances causing the disease had not yet been identified.
However, most patients reported that they had used electronic tobacco products containing four-hydrogen cannabis phenols, the main compounds that affect mental states in cannabis.
It is reported that the increase in lung diseases is related to the purchase of polluted electronic smokescreens in black markets.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention noted that the 12 deaths occurred in 10 states from California to Florida, with 805 confirmed and suspected cases reported from 46 states and the United States Virgin Islands.
In the past three weeks, India and the US state of Massachusetts have banned the sale of electronic tobacco, while New York and Michigan have banned the use of flavoured electronic tobacco.
It is reported that the Trump administration intends to ban all electronic tobacco products other than tobacco flavors from October.
When will the next bus arrive?
"Internet + Smart Websites" makes you count.
The first "Internet+Smart Stations" will be officially launched in Nanjing, where 54 bus electronic screens will be lit. This will completely upgrade the level of Nanjing information services and improve the efficiency of bus services and the happiness of the people travelling.
In the past, waiting-car anxiety scenes were performed almost every day at bus stations.
It is difficult to predict the time of bus operation, the condition of bus routes along the way and the location of vehicles is difficult to know, the problem of bus travel pain point is urgently to be solved, especially in some large cities, long commute routes, the traffic situation of early and late commute peak time is complicated, resulting in bus punctuation rate has been difficult to guarantee.
To this end, Nanjing Smart Transport Co-operates with the map of Kochi to deeply explore the new direction of "Internet + Transport" convenience service, launching the first nationwide "Internet + Smart Station Card" this intelligent service project.
It is reported that the first "Internet+Smart Stations" in the country landed in Nanjing, integrating the high-tech big data and the ETA algorithm of the high-tech vehicle's expected time of travel, and relying on bus electronic stations and mobile Internet, traffic big data upgrades, realize the "Bus Smart Stations+Electronic Maps" dual-end issuance of bus routes, bus expected time of station, etc.
Through the "Internet + Smart Station Card," Nanjing citizens can not only easily get the expected time of the bus to the station, know the actual location of the bus and how many more stations are located from the current station, but also can directly grasp the bus routes along the way through three colors of red, orange, and green, so that the bus routes on all the way to the station can be seen in real time.
Thanks to the launch of the "Internet + Smart Stations" technology, Nanjing citizens have achieved convenient and efficient modes of bus travel, such as "searching the location of buses before going out, catching up to the station time when waiting for buses, and knowing the time of arrival when sitting on buses."
According to the "Internet + smart station card" real-time bus information, choose the most suitable routes for your travel, while also having good psychological expectations, reducing the anxiety of waiting for the car, thus making travel become more convenient and acceptable.

New York Times: We must not move our own way
China and the World in the New Era White Paper, published on 27th July, answers: For 70 years, China's development has been successful because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have found the right path of development with Chinese characteristics and have steadfastly followed it.
It is the choice of history and the choice of the people that China should take the path of its own development.
Since modern times, in an environment of increasing poverty and weakness and internal and external problems, a generation of good-hearted patriots have searched up and down the path of saving the country and saving the people, going forward and backward.
However, “the constitutional monarchy, the restoration of the emperor, the parliamentary system, the multi-party system, and the presidential system have all been thought about, tried, and failed.”
It was not until the Communist Party of China and the new China that the Chinese people gradually opened up a road with Chinese characteristics in practice.
China's exit from this path is the path of the Chinese people's happiness, the path of the Chinese nation's revival, and it is also the path of China's common development with the world.
It is because China is on the right path that it can do its job well, become the second largest economy in the world, contribute the most to global economic growth, and continue to benefit the world through its own development.
As the White Paper points out, China's path of development, in keeping with China's national circumstances and adapting to the demands of the times, will show more and more bright prospects of development as the times progress.
The Chinese people know very well how difficult it is to find the right path. Looking around the world, the Chinese people cherish the right path even more.
The Chinese understand the principle of southern orange and northern orange, understand that what suits others does not necessarily suit themselves, only suits themselves is the best.
It is with this confidence and strategic determination that China has created a world-renowned miracle.
In the process of human convergence, the "end of history conclusion" was once called.
Today, the success of the Chinese characteristics road has declared the end of the "end of history conclusion," the collapse of the "Chinese collapse theory," the failure of the "socialist failure theory."
China's success has lifted the confidence of the developing countries to achieve the prosperity of their peoples and has expanded their paths towards modernization. It has provided experience and lessons for those countries and peoples in the world who both want to accelerate their development and want to maintain their own independence to take the path that suits their own circumstances.
The world is rich and varied.
China has always respected the right of countries to choose their own paths of development.
China will not "import" the foreign model, nor "export" the Chinese model, but will resolutely not move its own way, achieve its own continuous development, strengthen diplomatic and political exchanges with countries, and make the necessary contribution to the common realization of good and good governance.
The Fair Work Commission found that the manager of a Foodworks supermarket texted off a 66-year-old woman because she preferred to hire Asian-American workers, a move that was sharply criticized as “shameful.”
The committee says the way Ms. Gayle Ayton’s boss, Jeanbin Wang, who has worked for Wagga Wagga for more than 20 years, treats employees is “extremely unfair” and may be in breach of anti-discrimination laws.
Ms. Ayton told the commission that Mr. Wang had taken over the store in 2016, and that he had been “wanting to fire me” because she was not Chinese.
In this case, the committee’s vice-chairman, Peter Sams, conducted a search on the Internet and found “some recruitment advertisements that Mr. Wang had previously posted on various Australian Chinese employment forums.”
Among the job requirements listed in these positions, one said “first Asian lady” and the other said “first Asian staff.”
The third post said he was “more prone to overseas people (as in the original).”
Mr. Wang dismissed Ms Ayton by text message in April this year, later claiming that it was due to her absence and the alleged cash shortage from $5.10 to $30 on the ATM.
However, Mr. Sams said that Mr. Wang's reasons for dismissing Ms. Ayton were weak and lacked evidence.
For three years, she missed only one class, a total of several Australian dollars.
Ms Ayton, he said, was fired “in fact irrespective of her behaviour or performance.”
"It seems to me that, with the proof of Mr. Wang's advertisement, the defendant's real motive for dismissing her was that he was more willing to hire employees with Asian backgrounds," he said.
According to article 772(f) of the Fair Work Act, Mr. Wang's behaviour appears to constitute a violation of the anti-discrimination law and/or a dismissal of the applicant."
Mr. Sams said that, in view of Mr. Wang's "horrible" treatment of Ms. Ayton, he considered it inappropriate to restore her post.
He should consider paying compensation to Ms Ayton, who was a temporary worker and earned $26 a day.
In view of possible violations of anti-discrimination and labour relations legislation, Sams indicated that he would submit his rulings and documents to the Commission's competent authority to consider whether Mr. Wang's actions should be transferred to other bodies to investigate possible violations of state or federal law.
He said Mr. Wang did not give Ms. Ayton any opportunity to respond to the alleged reasons for her dismissal.
"I believe that the defendant has engaged in an unjust and biased procedure to dismiss the applicant, and Mr. Wang "waited" this opportunity, which he believed would 'prove' that the termination of the employment of the applicant was justified," he said.
“He was wrong ... ... when the defendant dismissed the applicant completely ignoring any naturally fair treatment given to her, shockingly, he was rude and extremely unfair in his dissenting behaviour.”
Although Foodworks is a small business, Mr. Sams says, “But to be frank, no right-wing employer will dismiss employees in the most unfair and dishonest way recognized in the case.”
“It is shameful,” he said, “and it is extremely unfair.”
Greater railway to meet National Day Golden Week passenger traffic increase 175 trains - China New Net
Qingdao, September 27 (China) - To meet the needs of passengers travelling during the National Day of the Golden Week, the Group will increase the number of popular direction trains daily during the holidays to 175 trains, increasing overall capacity during the peak of the National Day of the Golden Week passenger flow.
The Group will take a number of measures to improve passenger service during peak passenger traffic.
The three-storey security corridors at Guangzhou South Station have been optimized, 12 security corridors have been added, and 44 security corridors have been added to the three-storey waiting rooms. Furthermore, 19 self-service authentication devices have been added at Guangzhou South Station, totaling 71.
In order to alleviate the backlog and congestion of vehicles on the South-North Road, Guangzhou South Station will open three new parking spaces and 1,000 additional parking spaces to alleviate the pressure on traffic around the South Station.
Shenzhen North station will open the "high-speed railway-subway" green clearance channel.
On October 6–7, passengers will arrive at the peak time, and the exit of Shenzhen North Station A2 will connect to the subway and provide a free passage for passengers arriving at the peak time.
In addition, the East and West squares will normally have a U-shaped Love Expressway, for passengers arriving at the station 15 minutes before driving and special focus passenger services.
On the eve of the Golden Week of National Day, Guangdong-Kuzhu Passenger Terminal will conduct full-time operational training, ensuring that all personnel in charge of operations learn to master operational knowledge, improve the quality of service, ensure that train drivers have a good mental appearance, more professional standards of operational quality, take charge of every departure work, and provide better service to passengers.
6 people denied involvement in the sale of fake Daimaka newspapers to the High Court
Six men suspected of falsifying and selling Chinese passports, birth certificates and identification cards, including one Assistant Director of the National Registry Office and one businessman at the governor's level, passed the case on Thursday and the charges relating to trafficking in human beings and smuggling of migrants were transferred to the High Court.
The defence lawyer, who had originally represented the Native American defendant, Mr. Li Zhenhua, as well as Mr. Lear, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Dayton, applied to the judge to withdraw from the trial on behalf of the defendant, i.e. to cease to be the defendant's defence lawyer, and the court granted him approval.
He said he himself had provoked criticism from political opponents on behalf of the defendant, and his own Action Party was involved.
He emphasized that he himself was not afraid of any threats, but did not want to be used by irresponsible units to defame the Party of Action and the Hezbollah government or other Hezbollah leaders, so the decision was made after careful consideration.
He also stated that there was no conflict of interest between the defendant on behalf of the defendant and himself as a member of Congress, and that he was not legally prohibited from representing any of the defendants.
The six defendants were brought before the court on 12 September this year, and denied their guilt in the face of numerous allegations under article 26E of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act and article 466 of the Criminal Code (forgery of documents), and were not granted leave to stand trial.
On Thursday, two Judges of the Tribunal, Noshaha and Mazlan, approved the Appellant's application to transfer to the High Court the allegations relating to the Anti-Trafficking in Population and Anti-Trafficking in Immigration Act involving the six defendants, following statements made by both defendants; the allegations of forgery of documents will be heard at the Tribunal on 3 October, pending the transfer of the documents to the Appellant.
Earlier, six defendants had been arrested under the 2012 National Security Crimes (Special Measures) Act (SOSMA), so the judge did not grant bail.
Compatible with the Motherland - Quickly written by an armed police force
Kim Autumn, a military police unit consisting of soldiers with an average height of 1.83 meters on the parade ground, training is busy.
The shiny gunshots, the unique olive green and the red shouldercaps together form a bright landscape line.
A few days ago, reporters entered the battalion to feel the soldiers' determination to be loyal defenders of the Party and the people forever and their passion and pursuit of "the highest honour".
“Dreams illuminate brilliant lives, write immortal legends of the new era...” This is the band song collectively composed by paratroopers and soldiers of the paratroopers’ squadron – “Coming with the Motherland.”
In the team, the song is the motto of each team member.
Qi Xiaoqiang, a height of 1.92 meters, stands out in the side team.
As the flag-bearer of the National Guard, he has a deeper understanding of honour.
The soldier's honour comes from hard training.
As a flag-bearer Qi Xiaoqiang, training has always been high standards and strict demands.
He bound his sandbags to practice fitness, recorded the speed of his steps, covered his eyes with the width of his steps, and held his head against the wind to practice stability.
In his lifetime, there was a picture that was always unforgettable.
At a ceremony, it rained heavily, and no one left to watch the ceremony.
At the moment when the national flag rose, Qi Xiaoqiang felt deeply the glory represented by the five-star red flag on his shoulder.
In 2019, he was appointed as a Lieutenant-General.
The standards of action of the basemen and the flag-bearers are different.
Zhi Xiaoqiang introduced that although the pace of progress of the flag-bearer and base infantrymen is only 20 paces behind, it requires more effort in training.
The brigadier-general was the first in the first row, and directly determined the level of coordination of the squadron.
After training intensively, he kicks his legs repeatedly every day and practices a hard kick.
In the demonstration demonstration, his precision of pace and speed won the applause of the ranks and ranks.
Almost every soldier in the battalion has the same experience as Zhi Xiaoqiang.
Twenty years ago, the father of the warrior Zhu Asahi East participated in the 50th anniversary parade of the National Day.
In order to follow his father's footsteps and become a member of the battalion, he suffered setbacks once, but never discouraged.
“It is a privilege of my life to be able to walk through Tiananmen Square like my father, to receive the scrutiny of the Party and the people, and to eat what I want,” he said.
As he entered the honor room of the squadron, eight large letters of "Master of Capital Stability" appeared in the curtain.
The troops are all from the Beijing General Staff of the Military Police, an honourable traditional force that has undertaken major tasks such as the opening ceremony, the National Day celebrations, the security of the National Assembly of the Party and the prevention of terrorism in the capital, and has trained a large number of British-style groups and individuals such as the National Flag Guard and the National Hero's Central Team. More than 50 units and individuals have been awarded honorary titles by the State Council, the Central Military Commission and the Military Police Force, Mr Wang said.

The development achievements of the 70 years of New China, the results of the tireless struggle of the people of China's various ethnic groups, and the hard work of foreign experts.
For 70 years, a large number of foreign experts have come to China, together with the Chinese people, to engage in the cause of modernization and construction. They have made an indelible contribution that the Chinese people will never forget.
Mr. Han pointed out that China's development is at a new historical starting point, and the Chinese people are struggling tirelessly to win the Chinese elections in Beijing and Beijing, to win the great victory with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and to realize the Chinese dream of a great revival of the Chinese nation.
China will insist that “development is the first priority, talent is the first resource, and innovation is the first driving force,” vigorously implementing an innovation-driven development strategy to boost the economy.
Human beings are the most innovative factors, and China will accelerate the cultivation of a large number of strategic technological talents, technological commanders, young technological talents and high-level innovative teams at international level.
Mr. Han said that China's cause is one that is supported by the world's people, one that opens up to the world to learn, and one that cooperates with all the world's countries.
China will take a more open and inclusive stance, learn from people around the world, and firmly implement a policy of more active, more open and more effective recruitment of talent.
We sincerely welcome more and more foreign experts to China to innovate and start-ups, and welcome talented people from all over the world to participate in the modernization of China, to make greater contributions to the building of a community of human destiny, to the peaceful development of the world and to the cause of human progress.

China's railway deepest vertical well main well drilled into the bottom.
Xinhua News Agency (Xinhua) - China's first long-distance railway tunnel, the Li Li Li Tunnel 1, was successfully dug to the bottom on September 27, breaking the country's deepest railway tunnel record at 762.59 meters, according to China Railway Tunnel Bureau Group Co., Ltd.
In tunnel construction, vertical wells can help improve tunnel ventilation, improve the efficiency of drainage and guarantee construction safety.
“After the successful excavation of the main well of Mt. Kailong Tunnel 1, it will help to advance the construction of the underground carriage yard, open more working surfaces for the latter stage of the construction, and speed up the construction progress of the entire Mt. Kailong Tunnel,” said Song Tao, General Engineer of the Main Well Working Area of the Dali Project Department of the Central Railway Tunnel Bureau.
Mr. Song introduced that the construction of the high-rise tunnel No. 1 was carried out using the drilling method, equipped with large-scale specialized machinery such as the drilling rig, the drilling stable car, the drilling angler, the entire mobile metal template, the FJD-6A type umbrella drill, the center rotating grabbing rock machine, and so on. The mechanical flow line, such as the mechanical excavation system, the outburst system, the suspension system, the angler lift system, etc., was "four-tier integrated" and the whole process of mechanical operations such as eye-catching, explosion, outburst, molding installation, concrete casting, etc., greatly accelerated the construction progress.
It is known that the Dalian Railway from East to Dalian, from West to Dalian, has a total length of about 331 km and a design speed of 140 km/h, and is an important part of the China-Main International Railway Corridor.

TV series "Foolish Fox" scenes on the ground recreation of the first line by the detective police style
Cross-border fugitives captured in Tianjin Airport in recent days through the detective drama series Hunting Fox. Actors Wang Kai, Wang Gull and others shot important scenes of economic fugitive suspects being exiled back to the country. The filming process was supported by China Southern Airlines.
The Fox crew filmed at the airport the key clues to the success of Operation Fox’s law enforcement – tracking fugitives back to their homeland, holding down planes, signing arrest warrants, and so on.
The theater group captured several sets of scenes such as the landing deck, customs border check-in and aircraft cabin, cabin doors, and showcased China's first line of detectives and hunting fox heroes flying across the country, chasing fugitive criminals' difficult journeys and professional styles.
To complete the filming successfully, Fox's original team did extensive pre-production work, confirming each execution detail over and over, ensuring the most realistic and eye-catching visual effects.
It is reported that the show will also be shot in many foreign locations.
Vietnam will seize the opportunity to develop artificial intelligence.
The four criteria used to assess and rank cities for AI wave preparedness include prospects, ability to realize, asset base and development direction.
Singapore ranks first, followed by cities in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia.
Oliver Wyman, an organizing expert, told reporters in response: "I think it makes a lot of sense to review and evaluate cities like the Vietnam River and Ho Chi Minh City.
Overall, I think Vietnam's future is bright in the context of high growth rate, strong economic development paths, and rapidly developing talent base.
I think Vietnam is on the right track and doing well.
It is important that Vietnam knows how to use the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to drive its economy forward.”
Artificial intelligence is completely changing people's work, communications, and lifestyles.
It brings greater efficiency, but it also poses a threat to increasing social, economic, and technological inequality.
However, according to a global study by Oliver Wyman, the only city in the world today that is prepared for the breakthroughs of the AI era.

The Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is reading the report on the United Nations Sustainable Development.
There is a story of national unity, and China's national regional autonomy policy has achieved enormous successes, whether in Xinjiang, north-south of Tianshan Mountains, or in Tibet, in the snow-covered plateau.
Economic development, social prosperity and stability, people live in leisure industry.
Wang Yi said the picture exhibition also tells the story of the Chinese people's construction of ecological civilization, the story of peaceful development, the story of the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the story of the community of destiny.
As Chinese President Xi Jinping has said, the green water mountain is the gold mountain.
Through continuous efforts, China has taken the path of green development.
China pursues a peaceful foreign policy, actively establishes diplomatic relations with the world, plays a role in solving hot issues, and becomes a strong center of world peace.
Faced with the unprecedented changes of the century, China actively maintains the international system with the United Nations as its core.
Over the past 70 years, China has been youthful, proud and vibrant, and no matter how the international winds change, we will stick to our original hearts.
Wang Yi to meet Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malawi Kasera
Foreign Minister Wang Yi, member of the Council of State and Foreign Minister of China, met with Foreign Minister Kasera of Malawi during his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 26 May.
Wang Yi said that over the twelve years of Sino-Maori relations, relations between the two countries have been healthy and stable, and exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been steadily progressing.
Last year, President Xi Jinping invited President Mutarika to China to attend the Beijing Summit of the Central African Cooperation Forum. The leaders of the two countries held fruitful meetings to take China-Malaysia relations to a new level.
China is willing to work with the Malian side to continue to implement the important consensus reached by the two leaders and the results of the Beijing Summit of the Central African Cooperation Forum, and to promote the further development of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries.
China wishes to strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs with the Malian side in order to safeguard the mutual interests of both sides and the overall situation in Central African relations.
He said China is a true friend of Malawi and African countries, and China's development has benefited the people of Malawi.
The Malawi side insists on a Chinese policy and thanks China for its support and assistance to Malawi.
The Ma Party expects further development of relations between the two countries and welcomes more Chinese enterprises to invest and develop in the country.
Approximately 800 million people take part in national holidays to meet China's tourism needs
Approximately 800 million people will be on their way to the forthcoming Golden Week!
Several tourism platforms show that China's tourism consumption market is booming.
According to the National Day Travel Report, the number of domestic tourists during the National Day holiday this year is expected to approach 800 million, and there will also be more than 750,000 departures.
Currently, tourists from more than 500 cities book with the platform for tours, free time travel, customized tourism, local entertainment and other products involving 100 countries and regions.
According to the China Institute of Tourism, the national holidays last year received a total of 7.26 billion domestic visitors, an increase of 9.43 per cent.
Not only will the number of visitors this National Day holiday be more innovative, but the upgrading of consumption will be the “main melody” of the holidays.
According to the report, national holidays cost more than 3,000 yuan per person travelling across provinces in China, an increase compared to the same period last year, as tourists generally chose to experience better products, such as high-rated brand hotels, non-shopping tours, sophisticated tours, specialized coaches, and so on.
Similar trends have been observed in bookings by the Donkey Mama Travel Network, which has been more popular with comfortable cars and "private pleasure groups" of less than ten people on the domestic long-distance routes than in previous years.
Spring and autumn travel data show that consumers are more inclined to experience, service, and differentiate “from slow to easy.”
Flying pig data show that the number of tourist reservations in China's four lines and cities below has grown at the fastest rate, reaching 30% year-on-year, reflecting the upgrading of the consumption of residents in more areas of the country.
Personalization is one of the main features of Golden Week tourism this year.
According to transportation data, orders for self-driving cars on National Day holidays are expected to increase by nearly 60%, while short-distance self-driving on the periphery of hideouts continues to be popular, and private group enrolment has risen by up to 15%.
Sharing joy is one of the main purposes of people's tourism leisure.
According to travel data, 28 percent of national holiday visitors are family members, 25 percent are lovers, and 23 percent are co-workers and friends.
In addition, in terms of the age of the visitor, “after 80” and “after 90” account for more than 50 per cent of the total number of visitors.
Interestingly, unlike earlier Golden Week departures, which have grown more rapidly, this year’s domestic tourism markets have performed more “upbeatly.”
According to flying pig data, the number of reservations for domestic cultural trips during national holidays rose 42% this year, more than the number of departures.
Industry analysts say that while demand is high, tourism-supply-side reforms across the country are pushing for a richer “written travel feast” for tourists.
For example, the National General Administration of Sports and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism jointly launched the "2019 Golden Week Sports Tour Destinations"; the Shanghai Tourism Festival, which is being held in 2019, launched seven plates of 100 cultural and tourism activities to attract Chinese and foreign tourists; and near the Golden Week, several provinces such as Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Shandong introduced discounts or free tickets for scenic spots.
According to mobile booking data, Chongqing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Tianjin will be the most popular destinations for domestic tourism.
China’s first live-in theater film, “Now Now – Celebrating New China’s 70th Christmas,” will be screened simultaneously in 70 cinemas in more than 10 provinces across the country on October 1.

The head of the Central Broadcasting and Television (CTV) Headquarters introduced in Beijing on 27th that, on National Day, the headquarters will set up more than 100 seats and install more than 200 pick-up devices along Chang'an Street and the celebration area.
China is expected to become Australia's largest beef export market.
After the outbreak of the African swine fever, China faces a serious shortage of pork and is expected to become Australia's largest export market for beef, said an animal protein analyst at a Dutch cooperative bank, Rabobank.
After the outbreak, Chinese consumers are switching from consuming pork to other animal proteins, causing the authorities to destroy many stocks, with the number of live pigs in China halved over the past year and the price of pork nearly doubling.
China produces and consumes two-thirds of the world's pork.
China, the world's largest animal protein importer, currently imports 27% of the world's pork and 24% of the world's beef, says Chenjun Pan, a senior animal protein analyst at the Dutch Cooperative Bank China.
In the first half of this year, China's beef imports from Australia increased by 65%, making it Australia's largest beef export market, ahead of the US and Japan, Ms. Pan said.
Yesterday, the Chinese government said it would release more pork from emergency reserves before celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China's rule.

The world's oldest barber died at the age of 108. He cut his hair for 96 years
Anthony Mancinelli, 108, the world’s oldest hairdresser certified by the Guinness World Records in New York, never retired every day, but died of a complication of jaw cancer on 19 May, giving up his 96-year haircut life.
When he immigrated to the United States at the age of eight, he helped clean the floors in a hairdresser's shop, and when he was 12, he began using a cutter for his guests to ease the economic stress at home, CNN reported.
Mancini was in elementary school at the time, but did not graduate.
Mancini's son Robert revealed that his father loves work and people from all over the world love him. Although he was healthy, he was diagnosed with cancer in February this year and was unable to get back to work six weeks before his death due to physical conditions, but he wasn't retired because he was planning to get back to shaving while he was getting better.
Robert, 82, says he now needs to find a new barber after his father's death because he's had his father cut his hair all his life.
The repurchase of listed companies in the year exceeded 10 billion yuan, a record high - china.com
In order to stabilize the company's shares and preserve its image, listed companies have started to buy back shares frequently in the past two years, by means of targeted buybacks, collecting bids, etc., hoping to pass on the information that the value of the company is undervalued to the market, thereby stabilising the shares and strengthening investor confidence.
According to the data from Oriental Wealth Choice, the total amount of funds used by listed companies to buy back shares in 2017 amounted to 7.9 billion yuan, rising sharply to 5.1 billion yuan in 2018, and since 2019, the total amount of funds used by listed companies to buy back shares in A has exceeded 10 billion yuan, creating a record high in the amount of funds used by listed companies to buy back shares in A, well above the previous year.
From the point of view of the purpose of repurchase, the company's repurchase shares seem to have the same shareholding as the large shareholders, but there are great differences in implementing the subject matter, the source of funds, the repurchase purpose, the equity interests of the shares themselves.
Xu Yang, chairman of the Shanghai-based Michael Wing Information Advisory Co., Ltd., told the Securities Daily that the November 2018 opinion on supporting the repurchase of listed companies' shares had been revised to address existing problems such as narrow share repurchase scope, complex decision-making procedures, inadequate inventory systems.
In January of this year, China Exchange and Shenzhen Exchange officially issued the Rules for the Implementation of the Return of Shares of listed Companies. These policies broadened the sources of funds for the return of listed companies, simplified the procedures appropriately, guided the improvement of governance arrangements, and encouraged all types of listed companies to implement equity incentives or employee shareholding schemes.
After the opinion was issued, the operation of share repurchase by listed companies has more applicable circumstances, the repurchase process is easier and the share repurchase is more positive.
Repurchase of shares at a relatively low position is also beneficial for the listed company to increase the efficiency of the use of funds, thereby increasing the profit level of each share, increasing the net asset yield, and relieving the pressure of the company's profit index.
Compared with the increase in the shareholders, the significance of repurchasing shares of listed companies is greater, also reflects the willingness of the listed companies to manage active market value and abundant cash flow.
Xu Yang believes that undervalued stock prices are a major factor in the repurchase of listed companies, and that the company's stock prices have not been able to reflect the company's future development prospects, so such companies are worthy of investors' attention, but cannot invest blindly, and need to pay attention to the financial statements of such listed companies and the specific operating conditions.
Companies with large-scale buybacks at least demonstrate confidence in the company's development and financial strength.
The enthusiasm for buying back shares in listed companies A has gradually warmed, and the behavior of buying back has become normal, with figures showing that nearly 1,000 listed companies have implemented share buybacks this year, and leading companies in various industries have become the main players in the buyback market.
The company has acquired 5.759 million shares in A shares, accounting for 0.315 per cent of the company's total share capital, and has paid a total of $50 billion (excluding transaction costs), all of which will be used for employee equity plans, including long-term service plans, but not limited to those considered by the company's shareholders' meeting.
The company has paid $57.92 billion to buy back its shares and has recently adjusted its use of the shares, changing from the original plan to "all shares to be used as a source of share incentives in the later stages" to "a cumulative repurchase of 1.83 billion shares, of which 1.52 billion shares will be used as a source of share incentives, and the remaining 3.49 million shares to be disposed of to reduce the registered capital."
Eli shares said that it would be beneficial to further raise the level of return on each share, effectively increasing the return on investment of the company's shareholders.
TCL Group announced on September 25 that it had acquired 3.59 per cent of the company's shares at a total cost of $16.5 billion.
The TCL Group's Board of Directors office told reporters in the Securities Daily that the buyback would be used for employee equity plans, equity incentives or to convert listed companies' issued convertible corporate bonds into shares.
TCL Group adheres to its established business strategy, constantly improves its competitiveness and sustains its healthy development.
Based on confidence in the company's future development and the preservation of investors' interests, combined with the company's shares' performance in the secondary market over the past year and taking into account factors such as the company's operating and financial situation, the company plans to repurchase the company's shares using own funds, self-financing funds and other methods of financing.
According to Yang Delong, chief economist at the former Sea Open Source Fund, the company's repurchase operations can reduce the number of shares circulating in the market and increase the profits of each share, which is an important benefit for the shares in secondary markets. On the other hand, the company's willingness to take out gold and silver and repurchase and sell shares from the stock market has greatly boosted market confidence.
The repurchase of domestic listed companies has been increasing gradually in recent years, especially the best-performing stocks. It is a good way to boost investors' confidence through the repurchase of shares, and it is a positive and encouraging approach.
Hu Henghua, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Council and the secretary of the Changsha Party Party, and the four key players in engineering machinery manufacturing in the Xiangguan army – Jen Chung-Ning, Liang Sting-Gen, Ho Qing-hua, and Liu Fei-Kang – set a “small target” around “from engineering machinery to intelligent manufacturing” in Changsha to create a world-leading engineering machinery industry cluster three-and-a-half years later.
Changsha to create a world-leading engineering and mechanical industry cluster, in modern terms, is to create “the strongest on the planet.”
As a city of the Inner Province Council, Cheung Shao shouted this great saying, what is the underlying spirit?
It's the power of the hegemonic side.
The four engineering and mechanical companies participating in the dialogue, one by one, cover the whole fields of the sky, underground, sea and land: the mountain river intelligent light aircraft, the concrete conveying pumps of the CMU Heavy Industries, the whole ground lifting machine of the 31 Heavy Industries, the tunnel shield construction machine of the Iron Construction Heavy Industries.
At the time of geometry, China had virtually no speaking rights in the field of engineering machinery manufacturing.
With the advent of time, Chinese firms have taken the eastward wing of the Belt and Road Initiative, buying, merging, setting up factories, and so on, and have become a pioneer in the global engineering and mechanical industry.
The main economic indicators such as production value, market share, sales, etc. of engineering machinery companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Zhongyuan Heavy Industries, Iron and Steel Construction Heavy Industries, Shanhe Smart, etc., have led the same class of enterprises significantly.
It's the camera that drives the momentum.
The "Four Golden Stars" of Engineering Machinery Shogun, Cheungsha Engineering Machinery Industry Group, is the leading enterprise in the global engineering machinery industry.
In the world of industry, it is hard to talk about who can survive, and who can live well.
Earlier in the year, the global engineering machinery industry faced a cold winter, and many internationally renowned engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises collapsed, but Changsha engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises regarded "cat winter" as a "winter swim," self-imposed pressure, self-breakthrough, through industrial structure transformation, from manufacturing to intelligence transformation, not only uplifted the past, but also strengthened the bones of the body.
It is based on the political attempts of the stars to devote the moon.
Developing advantageous industries requires both enterprises to be active and the government to be active.
Changsha has the honor of being the capital of engineering machinery because it has gathered the whole chain of industries from top to bottom, created a number of related industries clusters, and by optimizing the business environment, perfecting the support services, simplifying the approval process, and so on, the enterprise's R&D, manufacturing, and sales costs are greatly reduced.
Good business ecology allows engineering machinery manufacturing enterprises to flourish.
History has pushed Changsha to the forefront of creating the world's leading engineering machinery level, when not I wait, when I don't let.
Both the government and the enterprises, and even the related industries and researchers, should seize the opportunity, take advantage of the momentum, set targets, continue to push forward, and contribute to the strength of Hunan for the construction and manufacture of a strong country.
Wang Yi presided over the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of China and the African members of the Council.
Wang Yi said China is a good brother and a good partner with African countries.
Whether in the past, now or in the future, China stands firmly with the African brothers.
We advocate the holding of this Foreign Ministers' Meeting as a concrete step towards implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and the leaders of African countries at the Beijing Summit of the Central African Cooperation Forum last September, in order to strengthen China's solidarity with African countries in the Council, and to promote better support for peace and development in Africa by the international community.
Wang Yi said Africa is China's most important and trusted partner.
As a permanent member of the Council, China's vote in the Council has always beenlonged to a large number of developing countries, including African countries.
Faced with the new situation, China wishes to join the African countries in the Council in strengthening solidarity and cooperation to safeguard common interests.
Both sides should work together, negotiate and resolve disputes, strive for self-sufficiency, and develop and govern fundamentally.
The foreign ministers of the participating African countries thanked China for its initiative to convene the meeting to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China.
The foreign ministers said that Africa and China have always been the most trustworthy and dependable partners in non-China relations, based on equality and mutual respect.
The African side appreciates China's important and active role as a permanent member of the Council in African affairs, as a powerful promoter of a just and equitable solution to Africa's problems and as a major contributor to the maintenance of African interests and the promotion of peace and security in Africa.
Africa is currently facing the threat of terrorism and extremism, and it is only by addressing security issues that Africa can truly achieve long-term peaceful development.

The autumn of September painted the Yellow Soil Plateau.
The 58-year-old villager, Shaviley, in the Zhuangma Town Farmers' Professional Cooperative, filled the sheep feed tank with the last shovel of grass and stood by the tank to watch the white lake goats chew.
“It’s delicious. It’ll sell for a good price when the autumn and winter are full of fat.”
Sheville says he feeds sheep “special nutritional meals” every day, cleans them regularly, sterilizes them, and serves them carefully.
She has been raising sheep for more than 20 years, until she came to work in a cooperative and learned how rough sheep farming was in the past.
The village is located in the southern part of Gansu Province, in Qingyang City, Qingcheng County.
His neighbors on the left and right were shepherds, but maintained a traditional breeding method, the quality of the sheep was poor, and the number of fences was small.
In June this year, under the guidance of the government, 140 poor people in the village joined the cooperative society, and everything started to change.
Shivali worked hard to cultivate all day long, because he always had a strong feeling in his heart.
The people who joined the company were poor people, and they all trusted the sheep in the cooperative, hoping that at the end of the year they would be able to distribute the dividends and sell them at a higher price.
With the guidance of technicians, he gradually learned how to prevent epidemics, mastered scientific feeding, and became one of the few “good breeding practices” in the village.
It is a standardized cooperative with 16 sheep ranches, raising nearly 1,400 lake sheep.
Zhou Tao, the head of the cooperative, said that standardized sheep shelters have doors inside and outside.
“The wool is thick and easy to raise bacteria, and lake sheep must not be kept in hot and humid places, and sheep tents must be built in three-sided ditches, and they must be fitted with a wind exchanger to ventilate and dissipate heat.”
In order to prevent epidemics, sheep should also be sprayed with mist and disinfected regularly, and sheep should be given three to four anti-epidemic needles every quarter, Zhou said.
In addition to living well, the sheep must eat grasses mixed with blue corn, wheat, alfalfa, etc., and have a sufficiently wide "field" to stretch their muscles.
The cooperative society adopts a system of supervision and replacement, guiding local farmers to place good breeds of lake goats here, uniformly feeding, managing and selling, and achieving good breeding, scientificization, standardization, and concentrated breeding.
Today, 140 poor households with sheep as shareholders receive more than 6,000 yuan a year in dividends. There are four registered card-holders working in cooperative societies.
In Gansu Qingyang, sheep farming is not just a transformation of the way of feeding, but the model of "Longleading Enterprises + Cooperatives + Farmers" has also changed the image of "sheep farming on the hills, sheep selling in the markets," overcoming the weaknesses of traditional farming, and farmers' poor days have become better because of modern sheep farming.
Zhou said that if market prices weaken, the local leading enterprise Gansu Zhongming Farming Development Co., Ltd., will take stock of the market protection price of 27 yuan per kilogram to help farmers disperse market risks.
Xu Jianfeng, general adviser to Zhongming Agriculture and Livestock Development Co., Ltd. in Gansu, said that enterprises are driving more and more poor people to think of "sheep farming" by providing loan guarantees, sheep supply, order breeding, quotation buying, and unified processing and sales services to the poor.
In Qingyang, at least 8,200 poor families achieved steady increases in yields through the cultivation, breeding, scale-up, slaughter division, and market sales of "member" crops.
The area of Qingyang City is in the northern agricultural pasture intersection zone, which is rich in fodder resources.
At present, there are 913 large-scale sheep farms and cooperatives in the city, feeding more than five million sheep, and two processing lines of 1.3 million sheep are being built.
French finance ministers say they will cut taxes by more than a billion euros next year and call on Germany to follow suit
LONDON, September 26 (AFP) – French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that France would reduce taxes by more than €100 billion ($109 billion) next year, while Germany should follow France’s fiscal stimulus to revive its sluggish economy.
In introducing France's 2020 budget, Lemel said the ECB's latest monetary easing measures created an opportunity for the governments of the able-bodied member states to increase investment.
The European Central Bank lowered interest rates to record lows on September 12, and plans to re-establish debt purchases to lower borrowing costs in an effort to stimulate economic recovery and boost inflation.
“Low interest rates will not restore prosperity in Europe, and monetary policy measures are necessary but not sufficient,” Lemel told reporters.
“Germany needs investment, and it needs it now, and the sooner the better. Don’t wait for the situation to get worse and move on,” he added.
He has made this appeal to Germany on several occasions.
France has already implemented tax cuts of more than €1 billion this year, which have brought a great boost to France's economic growth.
And the global economy is losing momentum, with the German economy, which relies on exports, taking the lead.
Lemel noted that next year the tax burden on French families will be reduced by €9.3 billion, including €50 billion in tax relief.
Moreover, the corporate tax burden will be reduced by nearly €1 billion as the corporate tax rate is gradually implemented from 33.3% to 25% over five years.
The Chinese government recently issued important instructions on the protection of the memorial facilities and stressed the need to strengthen the planning, construction, repair and maintenance of the mausoleum.
In order to deepen the implementation of the important instructional spirit of the Chinese People's Party (China People's Party) and strive to promote the management and protection of the Memorial Facilities, the General Office of the CPC, the General Office of the State Council and the General Office of the Central Military Commission issued the General Work Programme for the Planning, Construction, Repair, Management and Maintenance of the Memorial Facilities.
The Work Programme is an outline document for the management and protection of the Memorial Facilities. It clarifies the objectives and tasks of the management and protection of the Memorial Facilities, proposes plans for the construction of the Memorial Facilities, improves the promotion of the Red Educational Base System of the spirit of martyrdom, repairs and protects the Memorial Facilities, creates a strong social atmosphere of respect for the memory of martyrs, manages and maintains the Memorial Facilities, and forms a standardized organizational and safeguard management system.
The Work Programme clearly states that the rehabilitation and protection of the strongmen's memorial facilities should be increased, and that, in accordance with the principles of co-ordination and long-term consideration, the rehabilitation and protection of the strongmen's memorial facilities should be increased in practice, with the aim of improving the leadership mechanism and the policy and regulatory system, organizing the implementation of quality improvement projects, improving the facilities and equipment, and strengthening the service capacity, optimizing the content of exhibitions, and innovating exhibition methods to enhance overall effectiveness.
The Work Programme emphasizes the need to improve the system and organizational safeguards, strengthen the organizational leadership, establish a mechanism of work led by the Department of Veterans Affairs and with the active cooperation of the relevant units and widespread participation of society; to implement the Heroic Servicemen's Protection Law, improve the system of regulations and regulations, continuously promote the planning and construction of service facilities and maintain the institutionalization, standardization and professionalization of service facilities; to strengthen team building, introduce volunteer services, encourage veterans, veterans' families, specialist scholars and young students to participate actively in the presentation and maintenance of service facilities, etc.; to improve the social participation mechanism, insist on government-led, multi-stakeholder involvement, and actively advocate the encouragement of enterprises, social organizations and individuals to provide contributions and support for repair and protection of service facilities
Study: US National Health diet index rises slightly but still poses challenges - ChinaNet
The US government's healthy diet index has grown moderately over the past 16 years, from 56 to 58, according to a recent study by the American Overseas News Network.
But it's not worth celebrating when the score is 100.
Americans still face “significant challenges” in their diet.
One of the authors of the study, Dr. Zhang Fanfeng, a nutritional researcher at the University of Tafts, Massachusetts, said Americans still consume foods that are likely to cause heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other diseases that are among the most common among Americans.
The study was published in the Journal of American Medical Association on 24.
The study is based on the findings of a health survey of 4.4 million adults conducted by the U.S. government between 1999 and 2016.
The authors write, “Despite significant improvements, significant dietary challenges remain.”
These challenges reportedly include reducing the consumption of saturated fat foods such as snacks, hot dogs, fat beef, butter, and so on by Americans.
The study found that people's daily intake of these unhealthy fats rose from 11.5% to 12%, exceeding the recommended 10% limit.
The biggest improvement in the American diet has been the reduction in sugar intake from 16% to about 14%, but it is still too high.
Officials believe that daily intake of added sugar should be less than 10%.
Researchers believe the reason for the decrease in sugar intake is related to the reduction in people's consumption of sweet water, but Zhang emphasized that sugars are often added to even less sweet foods, such as sour milk and tomato sauce.
Adults in the United States have seen a slight increase in their intake of fruits, nuts, oats and other whole grains.
However, according to 2016 data, these foods still account for less than 5% of the daily diet.
Despite a slight reduction in salt consumption and a reduction in the consumption of low-quality carbohydrates from fruit juices, they still account for up to 42% of daily heat, many of which come from refined white breads and other refined grains, Zhang said.
The study is based on a two-year personal health survey that reminds adults of what they've eaten in the past 24 hours.
These health surveys have been conducted twice every few days since 2003.
A government-issued American diet guide recommends that people adopt a “healthy diet model” to reduce the likelihood of chronic disease.
The guide points out that people should eat more nutritious foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and protein-rich seafood, lean meat, poultry meat, eggs, and seeds.
The number of Americans with diabetes almost doubled during the survey, exceeding 7%, and the obesity rate increased during many years of the survey – now about 70% of American adults are overweight or obese.
In addition, heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the United States.
The EU's Strategic Partnership with Asia
The forum was attended by members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP), the secretary of the Central Registry, and the Minister of the Central Economy, Mr. Nguyen文平.
Based on the close cooperation between the EU and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, the forum’s theme was “Implementing the EU’s Connection with Asia: Building a Bridge for the Future of Sustainable Development.”
The forum will take place a year after the implementation of the EU's two continents' counter-insurgency strategy.
EU Commission Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said strengthening the takeover was part of the argument, as it brought benefits to the peoples and economies concerned.
The above-mentioned relationship contributes to stability and prosperity for the parties concerned.
At the same time, he believed that the EU wanted to send a message about enhancing engagement and strengthening mutually beneficial relations between Europe and Asia.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is an invited guest at the Forum and will deliver an important speech at the plenary meeting.
The nation's first equity bank financial subsidiary is set up to fund technology-enabled management
On 26th, Guangdong Bank's fully-funded subsidiary, Guangdong Financial Management Co., Ltd., was officially established in Qingdao. It is the first joint-stock bank financial management subsidiary established in China.
Experts say asset management is an important area for the development of financial technology, and the establishment of a financial management subsidiary is beneficial for banks to use technology to improve management operations.
In April this year, Gwangdao Bank and China Investment Bank announced that they had been approved by the China Banking Supervisory Board to set up a financial management subsidiary.
On 24 September, the bank announced that it was officially allowed to open.
Within two days, Guangdong Bank took over many shareholding banks and was the first to establish Guangdong Financial Management in Qingdao.
Li Xiaoping, Chairman of Guangdong Group, said that Guangdong Group will accelerate the pace of innovation, use modern technological thinking and means, rely on big data, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, increase the coverage rate, utilization rate and penetration rate of financial capital, increase the customer's sense of well-being and security.
By 2021, we will establish the "four pillars" of sound financial and technological development in China, further strengthen the application capacity of financial and technological industries, realize the depth of integration and coordination of financial and technological development, and obviously increase the satisfaction of the people with digitalization, networking, intelligent financial products and services.
Mr. Zhang Asahi Yang, chairman of Guangdong Financial Management Co., Ltd., introduced that the management platform of Guangdong Financial Management Co., Ltd. will use technologies such as smart prospecting, smart investing, big data, etc. to help Guangdong Financial Management Co. better judge the macroeconomic situation.
The future will also apply blockchain and other new technologies to grasp the direction and trends from traditional assets to alternative assets to digital alternative assets.
In the face of a new competitive situation in the management industry, financial technology companies and management institutions will explore new growth paths jointly with management technology, said Dong Chiu, a specially appointed researcher at the National Laboratory for Finance and Development.
Financial technology empowers the management industry, which is both the need for the transformation of financial technology itself and will inject new vitality and vitality into the development of management business.
Earlier this year, Beijing Digital Technology launched a new management technology system, using technology and digital means to enhance management's product development and wind control capabilities.
The new system has four main capabilities: product design, sales transactions, asset management, and risk assessment.
Experts believe that management technology can enhance customer service capability and product innovation while also enhancing risk prevention capability and improving management efficiency.
Zhang said that the risk preferences of customers were often identified through survey questionnaires, whereas now using artificial intelligence to image users helps to better locate customers, and according to the investment preferences of customers launch the corresponding products, helping to resolve the risks.
“Another kind of big data, such as electronic commerce, time and space data, can help us better map the activity and economic performance of a region, an industry, and so on.”
Zhang said big data technology will also help boost wind control capabilities while mitigating risks.
China's deepest tunnel elevation record rebuilt
After more than 1,200 days of day-and-night construction, the railway's elevated tunnel 1 at Jiangdao Ligongshan reached 762.59m below the ground on September 27, breaking the longest record in China's railway tunnels, a record created by flooding.
It is located in Yunnan, China, and is the longest single-hole double-line tunnel in Asia.
The tunnel crosses 19 fracture strips and is buried at a maximum depth of 1155 metres. Because it covers almost all potentially adverse geological conditions and major risks associated with the construction of the tunnel, the Highland Tunnel is known as the "Geological Museum" of tunnel construction.
Vertical wells are the most important auxiliary tunnels in the Highlands Tunnel, and are responsible for increasing the operational area to achieve the "long tunnel short run" and the important task of the later railway operation ventilation.
The first vertical well was successfully excavated to the bottom, marking the formal entry into the horizontal tunnel construction of the high-Leungshan tunnel. After the excavation and equipment replacement of the underground carriage yard, the underground can increase four operational surfaces, accelerating the speed of the tunnel's right-hole excavation.
“The vertical wells are all in granite soil, and because there are more cracks in the granite soil, the water cannot stop and flows from top to bottom, basically the deeper the wells are, the greater the pressure.”
According to Zhang Zhao, chief engineer of the Dalian Railway Projects Department at the Central Railway Tunnel Authority, the construction team invited experts to examine the treatment schemes on the spot after several incidents such as mudslides and collapses occurred during the construction of the vertical well.
“When the water flows in a vertical well, it reaches more than 300 cubic meters per hour, and a well depth of more than 700 meters is equal to a seabed depth of 700 meters.”
“If we don’t pump water in time, we’ll flood 10 meters in an hour,” said Mr. Zhang. “We spend almost 85 percent of our time cleaning water and 15 percent of our time digging.”
In order to overcome the problems of quality such as longitudinal arithmetic development, flooding of mud, rich water granite, etc., the tunnel construction uses system water treatment measures combined with "exploring, pouring, excavating" to reduce the construction risk.
After several improvements, the first vertical well construction formed a mechanical flow line such as excavation system, excavation system, suspension system, hanging lift system, and so on, and achieved all-process mechanical operations such as eye-catching, explosion, excavation, molding installation, concrete casting, and so on, speeding up the construction progress.
Eventually, after more than 1200 days of day and night construction, the vertical well was successfully completed at a depth of 762.59 metres.
The railway is 330 km long and forms an important part of the China-Mexico International Corridor. It is an important transport infrastructure for the construction of the Bel Belt and Road corridor.
After the completion of the transit, the travel time from Dali to Rili will be reduced from the current 6 hours on the highway to 2 hours, which will greatly improve the transportation pattern in the western Yunnan region, and will contribute to promoting China's economic and trade cooperation with Southeast Asia and Southeast Asia countries and people-to-people friendship.
Lin Cheng Yue: Being a Chinese makes you proud of your country's achievements
The Hong Kong press celebrates the 70th anniversary of National Day.
"Hong Kong Press Celebrates the 70th Anniversary of the Establishment of the People's Republic of China" was held on 27th in Hong Kong.
Speaking at the banquet, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mrs Lam Cheung-jue, said that the achievements of the country over the past 70 years have been witnessed by the world and we are proud as Chinese.
Ms Lin, Deputy Liaison Officer of the Central Government in Hong Kong Ms Lu Xinning, Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong Ms Song Yong-an, Deputy Political Member of the PLA Forces in Hong Kong Mr Chen Adian, Chairman of the Hong Kong Press Association's National Day Preparation Committee Chairman Mr Jiang Chung attended the Liquor Festival and served as the main guest.
In her speech, Ms Lin noted that China has made tremendous strides over the past 70 years, despite facing many difficult challenges, but has overcome them all. The achievements that have been made are visible to the world, and we are proud as Chinese.
Hong Kong has been closely linked to the Mainland since its return to the homeland, working together to make progress and share the fruitful achievements.
We believe that under the premise of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong's future can continue to play a leading role in grasping the opportunities of the Belt and Road corridor and the Great Bay Area in Guangdong and Hong Kong and Macau, and seek a better future for Hong Kong.
She also said that in the past few months, there have been ongoing social disputes in Hong Kong, and everyone in Hong Kong has been affected, and journalists have faced different challenges.
At this critical moment, I hope that our friends in the press will continue to meet the challenges, to work in a professional spirit, to make fair and equitable news reports for society, and to do their utmost for the future of Hong Kong and to re-establish a rational communication dialogue for society.
In his speech, Mr. Jiang pointed out that the glorious history of the new China was also the history of Hong Kong's development with the motherland, its common progress, its bloodline, and its common dignity.
In particular, since Hong Kong returned to its homeland, the Central Government has steadfastly pursued the principles of “one country, two systems,” “the Hong Kong people govern Hong Kong,” and high autonomy. Hong Kong and the Mainland have worked together in harmony with each other’s wishes, creating a miracle of mutual benefit, mutual gain, and economic prosperity.
To this end, the Hong Kong press community gathered to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
He said that over the past three months, Hong Kong has witnessed a series of publicly unlawful and deliberately undermining social stability acts of violence, with distorted and false reports in some of the media contributing to the violence.
He appealed to the media to raise the tide and create a good atmosphere for people to resist violence and uphold the rule of law.
Professional media professionals should adhere to the professional norms of journalism, guide the citizens consciously and violently with real reporting and responsible speech, and maintain the justice and dignity of the law.
Approximately 500 people from all walks of life, including the Hong Kong press, attended the event, and greeted the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with a glass of wine.
The Ministry of Public Information of the Xining Municipality has learned that the Xining City will implement the Ordinance on the Promotion of Civilian Behavior on October 1, focusing on 15 types of non-civil behaviour, such as pedestrians not passing by the direction of traffic lights and throwing objects from buildings, listing the priority control list and setting the corresponding penalties.
Mr. Wang Zing Bin, Deputy Minister for Publicity of Xining Municipality and Director of the City's Civilization Office, said that since 2017, when Xining City was awarded the National Civilization City Award, the citizens' civilization literacy and moral standards have improved significantly.
However, non-civilian behaviours such as walking on the streets, breaking the red lights, not passing by non-motor vehicles according to traffic direction lights, high-altitude throwing, car window throwing, smoking in public places, walking dogs in public places and letting things be the size of their own are still very prominent and easy to counteract, and need to be resolved as soon as possible.
The Ordinance, combined with the practicalities of Xining, sets forth a broader and higher standard of standards for the conduct of individuals and entities in civil society, from public places, public order, public facilities, public environment sanitation, civil travel, civil tourism, civil Internet, civil campus building, civil family building, public service execution, the commemoration of heroes and medical services, and so on, making it clear to the entire society what it can do, what it advocates, and what it prohibits.
“The establishment of regulations to eliminate blind spots and misunderstandings in the cognitive fields of civilized behavior, and the comprehensive regulation of citizens’ behaviour, ownership of homes, eating, traveling, education, tourism, the Internet, green life, and the cleansing of weddings and funerals, will provide a powerful legal guarantee for normalizing the work of creating a mass spiritual civilization in Xining City.”
The secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the Xining City Council said he was hostile to the military.

The British tourists dropped their car keys into the lake and the family was stranded in France for five days
Recently, a couple in Wales, England, took their two children on holiday in France and accidentally dropped their car keys into the lake. The family was forced to wait five days to get a new car manufacturer-made key.
The couple then left France with their children.
When the British family visited a French lake on September 16th local time, the daughter accidentally overturned a leather bag and dropped the car keys inside the lake, it was reported.
But they spent hours trying to find the key.
And all their belongings and cash are locked in the car.
Although British tourists purchased insurance before departure, the insurance company refused to help because of the danger that the vehicle would not be stolen.
They had to hire a tractor to drive the car to a garage and then reorder the keys from the car manufacturer.
A few days later, British tourists finally got the arranged keys, and the couple left France with their children.
Their scheduled trip was cancelled due to the loss of the car keys.
Saudi Arabia officially lifted travel visas for 49 countries, including China
Since then, Saudi Arabia has officially granted travel visas to 49 countries, including China, for a total of 440 Saudi Riyals (about 836 yuan).
Visitors are required to prepare a medical insurance covering the territory of Saudi Arabia and provide an address in Saudi Arabia for application.
Visitors can apply for a landing pass at the airport after the plane lands or apply for an electronic signature via visa.visitsaudi.com.
Among them, electronic signatures can be entered several times a year, allowing tourists to stay for a maximum of 90 days.
For ordinary tourists, Saudi Arabia is the most mysterious country, because the country never issues tourist visas.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been pushing ahead with its “Vision 2030” plan, aimed at reducing the country’s long-term dependence on oil, with open tourism and the development of tourism as an important component.
Belarusian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Lyashenko made a working visit to the province of Xinjiang in Vietnam.
At the meeting, the secretary of the Xinjiang Provincial Council, Mr. Dujians, emphasized the remarkable achievements of Belarus in industrial production and the investment of Belarusian enterprises in the province.
The completion and commissioning of the MAZ ASIA automotive production and installation plant is an important step in the cooperation between the two enterprises, which will help to promote cooperation between the province of Xinjiang and even Vietnam and Belarus.
The secretary of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Party Party said that the province has been creating favourable conditions for Belarusian enterprises investing in the province, and hoped that Belarus would take more vigorous measures in the future to encourage Belarusian enterprises to invest in the province and Vietnam, and to assist in the training and transfer of industrial production technology to the workers of the province.
Deputy Prime Minister Igor Lyashenko expressed his appreciation for the recent facilitation provided by Xinjiang province to Belarusian enterprises to carry out production and operational activities.
It is hoped that Xinjiang Province will continue to provide convenient conditions for Belarusian enterprises.
At the end of the meeting, a delegation of Deputy Prime Minister Igor Liashenko attended the completion ceremony of the MAZ ASIA automotive production and installation plant.
In the areas of low-risk food product licensing, the system of notification of commitments has been piloted and the foreign enterprises' representative offices have been delegated to the FTA
On 27th, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Authority (SMA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the newly-established government of Pudong Province to introduce 20 market regulation reform measures, some of which are pilots in the country.
According to the introduction, the notification commitment means that the administrative authority, when dealing with the relevant licensing registration matters, informs the applicant once and for all in written form of the conditions and requirements stipulated by the laws and regulations.
After the applicant signs the undertaking, the administrative authority can deal with it directly.
According to the memorandum, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Department will support the registration of enterprise names in the newly created Pudong New Area and the Shanghai Self-Trade Zone, the processing of permits for the production of simple, low-risk food varieties, and the approval of certain types of measuring instruments in three areas, such as the notification of commitments system, to facilitate the entry of enterprises.
Shanghai Shao Wan Food Co., Ltd. became the first company to benefit from a pilot dividend by obtaining a food production license on the spot by way of an announcement of commitment on 27th.
The heads of enterprises said that food permits could also be obtained on the spot, and that they had taken the “no-acceptance” approach of allowing enterprises to submit part of the material within the deadlines stipulated in the pledge, “a practical sense of the convenience of reform.”
The Shanghai market supervisory department says the notification commitment system for the implementation of food production licenses is the first pilot in the country.
After the reform, the process of approval and approval was compressed from the six previous processes of "Registration, Acceptance, Site Verification, Sampling Inspection, Material Verification, and Approval and Approval" to three processes of "Registration, Acceptance, and Approval and Approval", and the closing time was reduced from 20 working days before the reform to the current closing time.
Taking into account the high degree of external orientation of the浦东 economy, the Shanghai Market Regulatory Department has delegated the registration rights of the permanent representative offices of foreign (regional) enterprises to the Shanghai Self-Trade Zone, which makes it easier for enterprises to closely deal with them.
Statistics show that the devolution involves a total of 1592 permanent representative offices in the Shanghai STC, 99 of which have been dealt with under the new rules.
"11" Long-Term Vacation Consumption Small Survey: More Diverse Choices Tourism takes first place.
As the National Day holiday approaches, people's holiday plans are also gradually fixed.
The security daily recently launched a small survey on the arrangements for the "11th" holiday with friends and acquaintances. Nearly 20 pieces of feedback showed that although everyone's plans differed, "tourism + consumption" became the key words for the "11th" holiday.
Specifically, more than half of the reporters in the Securities Daily received feedback that they chose to travel.
Mr. Liu, a resident of Tianjin, said, “I plan to go to Shanghai with my family during the 11th, where Disney is the first stop, and then go to the surrounding cities.” Ms. Li’s family in Beijing has chosen to travel to Taiwan, where “three of them set off on September 28 and plan to spend ten days on the island.” Ms. Ma in Chongqing plans to leave for Singapore, while Mr. Zhang’s family in Hebei has chosen to go on a self-driving trip, saying, “My daughter is less than two years old and it’s not easy to get out of the long gate, so I plan to drive to Shandong and spend a few days on the seaside.”
According to the "2019 National Day Golden Week Travel and Exit Trend Report" released jointly by Yinglong and Yinglong Tourism, there is a clear trend of upgrading consumer spending in the three segments of travel, living and leisure during the National Day Golden Week this year.
The penetration rate of airplanes and high-speed trains has steadily increased, and the demand for star-class hotels and personalized non-standard accommodation has increased.
On September 23, 2019, the National Day Tourism Consumption Trends Report, released by the American group, showed that tourism consumption continued to be strong, and showed a diversified upward trend of "eating and playing".
More and more young people are interested in high-quality, distinctive experiences, cultural tourism, night tourism, and so on.
In addition to tourism, all kinds of consumption demands are also concentrated in the period of "11".
Mr. Wang, a resident of Chengdu, told the Securities Daily that “the main plan for this year’s Eleventh is to buy a car.”
Workers at a 4S car brand in Beijing told SETimes that September and October are generally referred to as the golden months for car sales.
During the 11th, many activities will be introduced at the doors of the stores, such as a lottery, discounts at stores, etc.
Moreover, many brands have recently launched new models, and new ones are expected to boost sales more significantly.
Under the trend of consumption upgrading, people pay more attention to the satisfaction of the needs of the spiritual level, and the share of service consumption such as culture, education, etc. is increasing.
“Culture and education have been at the forefront of household spending ever since children were born,” said Ms. Du, a resident in Beijing.
This year’s 11th has been packed, and I’m going to the Astronomy and Children’s Theatre, camping in tents at the Museum of the Elves and taking some hands-on experiences on a couple of weekends.”
According to some industry, in theory, the evolution path of consumers' consumption upgrading is the evolution of survival-type consumption to development-type consumption and enjoy-type consumption, in which a considerable part of content of enjoy-type consumption is the category of service-type consumption.
With the continuous development of our economic society and the rising level of income of residents, people pay more and more attention to the consumption demand of the spiritual level, tourism and travel is a good way.
Especially to catch up with the "11th" National Day holiday, the time is more abundant, people are more willing to travel and consume, which can satisfy the consumption demand of the spiritual level, and reflects the upgrading of the consumption of the residents.
The afternoon began lonely, and did not want to go out, has not adjusted well the state of the children is not around.
Get up and say to the dog Nana: Mom took you out.
The characteristics of type A blood are getting stronger and stronger, and they all feel strange.
Take a suit, buy nutrients, pay, buy fish chips, Nana little snacks.
The above is the reason for going out.
On the phone, I just told my sister, Rose, that it was thanks to Nana, or even to buy a snack.
There was a few laughs, and the child said the phone was off.
Nana jumped up to the assistant's seat, and lay down in earnestness, knowing that she had lost her way, fearful, and unwilling to accompany me.
husband boo hardly came back early.
And then went to the bedroom and lay on the bed and watched TV.
At seven o'clock in the morning, when the sun was rising and setting, the sky was darkened.
The moon has been invented in the circle of friends, and today is Mid-Autumn.
Wash a bunch of grapes sent by friends, leave half to Boo, and put the rest in the bowls you like, and take them out to look at the moon.
I sat down with Nana on the ground, and I ate grapes, and she ate skins, and I poured out the seeds of the grapes far away.
The moon hides in the clouds, and walks in the clouds; and the moon appears suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly, and suddenly.
In my mind there were all kinds of poems about the moon, but I only liked this one clearly: Every three or five o'clock round / The curtain was full of light / One round of the day was devoted to it / Everyone looked up and down.
Maybe we've given too much emotion to the moon, and I'm here to say that, in fact, that God's to God, Caesar's to Caesar is the best.
The moon is the moon, the emotion is yours.
Having eaten the grapes, this group is cold and cold.
There was a slight snoring at the foot of Nana's group, and she stood up, and laid her little blanket on the side of her little house, on which Nana lay happily.
Open the door and cry out: Is the bath water hot?
You can't see the moon from the bathroom window, you can only feel the color of the moon, turn off the bathroom lights, pull out the glass.
I don't eat moon cakes and I don't drink.
The 2020 Dubai World Expo will feature mascots.
The 2020 Dubai Expo mascot launch ceremony was held on 26 October in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
The mascot consists of six cartoon characters, including two UAE children, three flying robots, and one UAE bean tree.
The presentation introduced the audience to the six mascots through a video clip.
A nine-year-old boy, Rashid, and an eight-year-old girl, Latif, are brothers and sisters representing the people of the United Arab Emirates.
The three robots correspond to the three sub-themes of the current World Expo: blue robots represent “mobility,” green robots represent “sustainability,” and yellow robots represent “opportunities.”
An ancient bean tree named Salama, the “old grandmother” of the five “little guys,” symbolizes the ancestors who guarded the land.
“I am convinced that Dubai’s mascots will convey the traditional spirit of storytelling, showcase the creativity of local talents, and express our ambition and expectations,” said Dubai’s High-level Committee Chairman Ahmed, who said the mascots could strengthen the emotional connection between large-scale events and participants.
The release ceremony was attended by the Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, Crown Prince Hamdan of Dubai, the Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, and the Director of the Dubai Sebassy, Lim Hashemi.
The Dubai World Expo will be held in Dubai from 20 October 2020 to 10 April 2021, with the theme “Communicating ideas to create a future.”
This will be the first time the World Expo has been held in the Middle East.
Starting next year, Chinese students will be able to apply for a German undergraduate degree on the basis of their entrance exam results
Recently, Germany's Anabin database, which is responsible for evaluating and certifying foreign educational qualifications, announced on its website: Starting in 2020, Chinese high school graduates will be able to apply directly for a German university undergraduate degree on the basis of their entrance examination results, without having to register at a domestic university first.
Until then, Chinese high school graduates who want to apply for a German university would need to study undergraduate degrees at home for one semester (211,985 universities) or three semesters (general undergraduate degrees) and pass an APS examination or TestAS examination.
The new regulations will save Chinese students willing to study in Germany at least half a year.
The new regulations are expected to enter into force in the second half of 2019.
Applicants must satisfy the following requirements: complete 12 years of formal compulsory education, obtain a certificate of high school graduation, take part in board examinations, college entrance examinations, and have a total score of 70% or more (750 or more if the total score is 525 or more) and include two language proficiency and one achievement in mathematics or natural sciences.
Furthermore, the requirements for the results of the entrance examination are not exactly the same.
For example, if you apply for a medical, oral, veterinary, or pharmaceutical specialty, the entrance exam scores must be at least 80%, and the entrance exam subjects must include at least two subjects in mathematics, physics, chemistry, or biology, or take part in a science review; if you apply for a legal specialty, the entrance exam scores must be at least 80%, and the entrance exam subjects must include at least two subjects in foreign languages, history, or geography, or take part in a literature review.
According to incomplete statistics, many countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, etc., have recognized Chinese entrance examination results.
For example, universities such as Cambridge University, Birmingham University and Leicester University accept Chinese students by applying for entrance examination results.
Military "Machine Dog" First Show Class Sun Theater: Consider joining the show crew.
The U.S. military has funded the development of " machine dogs " for battlefields, and now may get on the stage before the circus!
The Solar Circus said it is in talks with Boston Dynamics, a company that develops robots, to discuss the feasibility of using robots in circus performances.
Boston Dynamic Technology Co. released a promotional video for its four-legged robot, Spot, which shows that it is a fast-moving robot that can carry 14 kilograms, has a highly adaptive mobility, 360 degrees of avoidance, navigation, remote control and autonomy.
Specifically, Spot has a proprietary software platform designed exclusively for Spot, where users can set their own robotic capabilities through various applications.
The Boston Dynamic Technology Company first published the concept of a machine dog in 1992, which was a sensation at the time, but has not yet really entered commercial application.
The Boston Power Technology Company, however, noted that Spot is now in the production phase, with customers mostly from the construction and energy industries.
In addition, Solar Horse is currently in talks with Boston Power Technology, which says the plan is still in the planning stages and is assessing the potential of Spot's use on stage.

Will Mawar run for a seat in the National Assembly in Denver?
Governor Sly Wei Jiaoxiang, Chairman of the Mahua Association: " The Supreme Council of the National Front is discussing! "
The re-election of Dandelby to the National Assembly, i.e. whether Mahua, a member of the National Front, will take up the traditional national seat, is a matter of concern.
However, after a meeting of the Maoist Central Committee, it was announced that the Supreme Council of the National Front would decide whether the traditional Maoist seat would continue to be transferred to the Maoist Front or replaced by other member parties.
Wei Jiao Xiang, who presided over the Mahua Central Committee's meeting on Thursday afternoon, told the media that any re-election would be conducted in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), i.e. it would have to be approved by the National Front's Supreme Council.
He said that as the Election Commission was due to meet next Monday (October 1st) to decide on the re-election of Danube Province, a meeting of the National Front's Supreme Council was expected in early October.
“Yesterday morning, I also met with National Front Chairman Nasr al-Sri al-Zahi, and we all agreed on the need to regain the seat from the hoped-for alliance.”
“We have agreed to hold a special UNPF leadership meeting in early October, in which the three-party leader of the UNPF will determine which party is to be represented.”
Asked whether Mao would insist on standing on the traditional chairmanship of the Supreme Council of the National Front, Wei reiterated that as Chairman of the National Front, he must act in accordance with standard operating procedures and that any decision must be agreed upon by the National Front.
“In any re-election, there is a willingness to run, there is a party, there is a side that thinks they should come out, and that is something that is commonplace.”
Most importantly, what organizations and political alliances do we come from
“It’s a big test for us to form a political coalition over the years, and we believe that the National Front has some valuable values along the way.”
"In the process, someone might say something, and that's no surprise.
“However, once the Supreme Council of the National Front has made a decision, it is the most valuable thing that everyone must do their utmost to prepare for the war.”
In any case, Wei said, Ma Hua will make every effort to prepare for the upcoming re-election of Dandelion's provincial seat at three levels: the District Council, the State Committee and the Central Committee.
"The District Council will be headed by the Chairman of the District Council, Mr. Sly Huang Jiang; the State Council will be headed by the Chairman of the District Council, Mr. Lin Pei-xiang; and the Central Council will be deployed by the Chairman of the District Council, Mr. Ma Han-sung, and the Secretary General, Mr. Zhang Cheng-wen."
On Saturday (September 21), a member of the House of Representatives of the Indigenous Unity Party, Nawab Mohammed Fawli, died at the government hospital in Bujumbura at the age of 42 due to a heart problem.
A villager in Hoyang County, Hubei Province, who hunted wild animals was ordered to " compulsory tour mountains "
A villager in Hokang County, Hubei Province, was sentenced for hunting wild animals and ordered to compensate for damage to ecological resources and the environment at a cost of 15420 yuan (RMB, below).
Due to the poverty of the defendant's family, the prosecutor's office enacted alternative labor compensation for ecological restoration costs and achieved the organic unification of legal and social effects.
Wang Chung-rya, the deputy prosecutor of the Hong Kong County Public Prosecutor's Office, introduced on 27th that, through three months of alternative labor such as "compulsory mountaineering," the defendant had developed deep feelings with wild monkeys and felt deeply responsible for the past behavior of hunting animals.
On June 21, this year, a criminal case involving civil public goods in the area of ecological resources brought by the District Prosecutor's Office of Bao Kang County was heard openly and pronounced in court.
The defendant was sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment for three years, suspended sentence for four years, and fined 3,000 yuan, and ordered to compensate him for the environmental damage caused by ecological resources at a cost of 15420 yuan.
According to the investigation, more than 20 wildlife species, including antelopes, squirrels, and capuchins, were hunted on the mountain cliffs from late January 2014 onwards.
It is the second-class national endangered wildlife sanctuary, and is listed in the National List for the Conservation of Land-based Wildlife.
In the course of the trial, Zhou admitted to his wrongful facts and acts and was willing to assume the accompanying civil liability.
However, given the poor economic situation in Zhou's family, the local village committee, forestry station and Zhou's three sides reached an alternative labour compensation agreement under the coordination of the Provincial Prosecutor's Office in Bukang County, namely, Zhou's will provide public-interest labour compensation for the cost of ecological restoration by carrying out monkey domestication maintenance work, compulsory mountain touring and forest protection in the village monkey protection area for one year.
In response to the Prosecutor's suggestion, the court acknowledged that it agreed to implement the suspension on a weekly basis, while actively fulfilling its obligation to "compensate alternative labour for ecological restoration costs".
At the moment, he has been working in the monkey protection area for three months, touring the mountains actively and performing well.
In recent years, the Prosecutor's Office of Bao Kang County has integrated the functions of prosecution and social governance in practice, and has applied scientific methods of supervision such as prosecution advice, investigation supervision, litigation supervision, and so on to minimize the damage caused by criminal acts to the ecological environment through judicial means.
The United Nations awards the Earth Guardian Award to the ant forest
With warm applause and lively music, the ants forest project’s head, Xu Dee, and user representative, Shen Jun Liang, walked up to the podium to receive the trophy from the hosts for the 2019 United Nations Earth Warrior Award.
The 2019 Earth Warrior Award Ceremony was held in New York City, United States on 26 September 2019, and the ants forest project, which inspired millions of people to take part in environmental action with mobile apps, was awarded the Incentives and Action Award.
A week ago, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced the winners' list at its headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, but people attending the ceremony that day were still very excited.
"The ant forest is an exciting innovation," UN Environment Programme Executive Director E. E. Annan told Xinhua News Agency. "It brings billions of people into action to understand the environmental challenges faced by humans and what they can do for the environment.
It will have a huge impact by connecting people and the environment with technology, enabling each individual to participate in the actions to protect the Earth.
The ant forest was launched in August 2016 by China’s ant financial services group, ant gold clothing, on the Pay宝 platform, where users save “green energy” by recording their daily green trips in the ant forest, paying for electricity and water online, and “planting trees” on their mobile phones.
Each time a user forms a virtual tree, ant forests and public-interest partners plant the next real tree in the deserted area.
As of August this year, 500 million ant forest users have reduced carbon emissions by 79 million tonnes and planted 1.2 billion trees in desertified areas.
Costa Rica’s President Carlos Alvarado, who presented the award on the day, praised the ant forest’s contribution to “invigorating so many people to participate in green action.”
"The Earth Guard Award is a confirmation of the ant forest project," said Mr. In, chairman and chief executive of Ant Goldwear.
Technology and open platforms make it possible for people to participate in low-carbon lives, an honour that belongs to all participants.
"The ant forest has affected 500 million people in the past three years, and the goal of the next three years is to drive a billion people around the world to participate in low-carbon action," he said.
At the same time as combating desertification and protecting the environment, they are also exploring how to make farmers' incomes more from the green water of Qingshan.
In addition to providing employment opportunities by planting trees, we also hope to help farmers to increase yields through agricultural development projects, electronic platforms, etc.
The ants forest model, which is based on digital technology, has also been successfully launched and used by other countries.
In June, the Philippines’ largest “electronic wallet,” GCash, launched the Philippine version of the ant forest, encouraging Filipino users to better protect the environment through low-carbon lifestyles.
GCash will work with the Philippine Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, environmental NGOs and others to plant 36.5 million trees in the Philippines within a year, the project said.
The Global Guardian Award is the highest award in the United Nations environmental field and is given annually.
The ant forest was awarded for the third year in a row the "Inspiration and Action Award" for a green innovation project from China, following the construction of the Shehan Dam forest site in China and the Zhejiang Province's "Thousand Village Demonstration, One Hundred Village Remediation" project.
Economic and trade friction affects the U.S. economy.
The U.S.'s second-quarter economic "performance report" shows that growth in gross domestic product (GDP) slowed sharply compared to the previous quarter, owing to a sharp decline in private sector investment and exports.
Analysts point out that economic and trade friction and the uncertainty it brings are the main causes of the decline in private sector investment and exports in the second quarter.
US GDP grew by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, on par with previous revised figures, but significantly below the 3.1% in the first quarter, according to final revised figures released by the US Department of Commerce on 26 September.
Consumption growth, according to data, is the main factor supporting US economic growth in the second quarter.
Consumption spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the U.S. economy, grew by 4.6 per cent year-on-year, boosting economic growth by 3.03 percentage points.
In addition, government spending and investment have driven economic growth by 0.82 percentage points.
However, private-sector investment fell 6.3% in the second quarter, dragging economic growth by 1.16 percentage points; exports fell 5.7% in the first quarter, and net exports dragged economic growth by 0.68 percentage points.
Private-sector investments have not only failed to maintain the momentum of last year's growth, but have dropped sharply because of economic friction and rising uncertainty, said Barry Knopf, managing partner at Encede Macroeconomics Consulting, a US firm.
Cnap says corporate capital spending in the United States is expected to continue to decline next year, amid uncertainty over policy.
Analysts believe that while consumption growth has provided strong support to the U.S. economy in the second quarter, there are more and more signs that trade and economic friction and uncertainty have affected consumer confidence and adversely affected U.S. consumer prospects.
In a recent survey, 38 per cent of consumers spontaneously referred to the negative impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy, a record high for the past year and a half, said Richard Courtin, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
Analysts generally believe that the U.S. economy will continue to slow in the future.
But experts also say the US industrial sector and financial markets will improve if trade and economic friction is eased.
The future U.S. economy is expected to continue its downward trend since this year, with growth falling to lower levels than in the second quarter, according to British economist and intelligence global economist Karen Burch.
Moody’s analyst Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, predicts that the US economy will grow by 2.3% this year, and slow further to 1.6% next year, assuming trade and economic frictions do not continue to escalate.
Alan Hutchins, investment manager at Patnam Investment Company, said the biggest concern for companies at the moment is the economic and trade dispute and the uncertainty it brings. If the economic and trade dispute can be resolved, the uncertainty will be significantly reduced and the performance of the industry sector will be much better than it is now.
Matt Melley, stock strategist at Miller-Tabak asset management company, says trade and economic friction remains the “first issue” and the main reason for the sharp fluctuations in US capital markets this year. Whether trade and economic frictions are properly addressed will be key to influencing the direction of US capital markets for the remainder of the year.
Parents of children aged 0 to 3 can take 10 days off each year
Safeguarding women's legitimate rights and interests is the embodiment of respecting and safeguarding human rights, and is also an important sign of the progress of social civilization.
On September 27, at the 15th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Session of the People's Congress of Ningxia Autonomous Region, the Ordinance on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women in Ningxia Autonomous Region was passed by a large majority.
This is a comprehensive system of local regulations for the protection of women's legitimate rights and interests, which was formulated and promulgated by Ningxia's first provincial government, and will be officially implemented from November 1, 2019.
It is understood that the Ordinance, which was adopted this time, was revised on the basis of the 2007 Ningxia Implementation Measures of the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women of the People's Republic of China, and it is divided into 9 chapters 65, including general provisions, political rights, cultural education rights, labour and social security rights, property rights, personal rights, marital family rights, legal responsibilities and supplementary provisions.
In the Ordinance, Ningxia encourages research into the practice of joint parental leave for couples, which is still the first in the country.
The Guidance on Promoting the Development of Child Care Services for Children Under the Ages of 3 was issued by the State Council Office in April this year.
In the process of amending the Ordinance, Ningxia introduced an innovation to "encourage the employing units of couples who have children in accordance with the laws and regulations to give each couple ten days of child-raising leave each year during the period of zero to three years of age."
At the same time, the Ordinance emphasizes the protection of women under the age of 18 against sexual harassment.
Article 43 of the Ordinance takes into account the latest legislative results of the Personality Rights Compilation of the Chinese Civil Code and elaborates provisions on the constituent elements of sexual harassment, the subjects and mechanisms of anti-sexual harassment.
Article 44 of the Ordinance explicitly prohibits harmful incidents of sexual assault on girls and requires educational institutions to carry out relevant education, protection and prevention work, which is a new benchmark in local legislation to protect girls.
With regard to women's right to know and deal with the common property of the married family, Article 35 of the Ordinance explicitly stipulates women's right to know and deal with the common property and the obligations of property registration bodies and related entities to provide solid institutional support for women's rights.
Moreover, in response to the social hotspot of gender discrimination in employment, Article 26 of the Ordinance not only prohibits direct discrimination, but also orders the prohibition of indirect discrimination. It also incorporates the latest experience of collective bargaining practices, strengthens the punishment of gender-discriminatory illegal acts, and strengthens the protection of women’s legitimate rights.
In recent years, the Joint Public Prosecutor's Office of Ningxia Women's Union, civil affairs and other departments have been very effective in promoting and introducing social professionals to participate in the mediation of marital and family conflicts and work against domestic violence.
The Ordinance summarizes and promotes this, encourages the mobilization of social forces and the accumulation of social resources to jointly protect women's rights and interests, and requires the people's governments at or above the county level to provide stable, institutional guarantees and support through the purchase of services.
Yuan Longping, a member of the Inner Mongolia Jiangxian League, works in the fields of salt-tolerant alkaline rice crop
On 27th, reporters from the administrative department of the Xing'an Alliance of Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region were informed that good news had come from the "Xing'an Alliance's Yuan Longping Academician Working Station for the Testing and Acceptance and Evaluation of Rice Resistance to Salt and Alkali on the Site" which was held in the Alliance yesterday.
A team of six experts from Heilongjiang Province Agricultural Academy, Yangzhou University and Hunan Province Agricultural Rural Office conducted sampling and harvesting of rice from the Xing Salt Series on the spot.
Based on expert assessments, the average yield of salt-resistant alkaline rice is 508.8 kg per acre, with pH values of 8.8 to 9.6 and salinity contents of 5 to 6 %.
“On the basis of this year’s trials, we intend to continue to innovate and reform, re-cultivate and optimize salt-tolerant rice varieties for better quality and higher yields,” said Wang Xiang, director of the Xiang An Alliance’s Yuan Longping work station.
“I believe that, with the constant strengthening of science and technology, salt-tolerant rice will continue to produce miracles on the salt-tolerant soil,” said the head of the group of experts on production measurement, deputy dean of the Heilongjiang Agricultural Academy and a researcher.
It is located at the southern foot of the Greater Xianshan Mountains.
In October 2018, Yuan Longping was inaugurated as a member of the Xi'an Alliance.
Yuan Longping led a team of experts to accelerate the introduction and promotion of the latest cultivated salt-based hybrid rice varieties and advanced technologies, and built a 960-acre salt-based rice base in the center of the right flank of Korchin, using side-testing demonstrations and side-promotion of technology routes, helping to promote the local poor population to increase production and yields, and get out of poverty to become rich.
This field measurement of salinity-resistant rice provides scientific basis not only for raising the salinity-resistant rice fields in Xi'an alliance, but also for raising the salinity-resistant rice fields in China under the same conditions.
After a marathon debate and several weeks of protests, New Australia passed the abortion legalization bill on September 26 at local time, according to the Australian Network.
The bill has sparked political debate over the past eight weeks, and serious divisions have arisen within the Liberal Party of Australia since independent MP John Greene announced its introduction.
After nearly 40 hours of discussion, the Australian Senate passed the abortion legalization bill by 26 to 14 votes on the evening of 25 May, making it the third longest-running bill in the state's Senate.
On the morning of the 26th, after a final vote in the New States House of Representatives, abortion was legalized in the state.
The bill allows women to terminate their pregnancy after 22 weeks, and allows abortions later in pregnancy if two doctors agree.
The Senate passed an amendment late on the 25th that allowed doctors to seek advice from the multidisciplinary group of the Hospital Advisory Committee before performing abortion operations on women 22 weeks after pregnancy.
In addition, amendments passed by the Senate also included the requirement for doctors to provide appropriate care for babies who survive after termination of pregnancy.
Previously, the governor of New Jersey, Berwicklin, had faced public criticism from conservatives of the bill, and Berwicklin intervened several times to gain more debate time for the bill, but did not attend the final vote.
“I need to spend time managing the whole of the new state,” she argued in defense of her absence.
It is reported that Liberal MP David Davis, who was the strongest opponent of the abortion bill, threatened to withdraw from the new state government and called it a “government crisis.”
But then Davis made a concession.
“The contents of the amendment to the abortion legalization bill that was presented to the House on the 26th morning actually provide more protection for women and doctors,” Davis said.
At the same time, Australian New State National Party leader Barry Laro said he was proud to be a member of the government that legalized abortion.
“What we achieved last night is historic for New York, and it makes abortion legal, no longer a criminal act, and no longer treats abortive women as criminals.”

Liu Qun made the above statement at a joint meeting of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, and the National Commission for the Development of Parts of the State Capital to Enrich Social Security Fund.
“The transfer of some state-owned capital to supplement social security funds is an important step in reforming and perfecting the basic pension insurance system. It is the full embodiment of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises and the equity between generations of the basic pension insurance system, and it is a policy measure based on the current situation and taking into account the long-term.”
In 2017, the State Council issued the "Programme for the Implementation of the Restructuring of Parts of State-owned Capital to Enrich Social Security Funds", requiring the selection of some central enterprises and some provinces to conduct pilot projects.
According to Liu Qun, the first phase of the restructuring work has achieved positive results.
At the central level, the restructuring of three batches of 67 central enterprises and central financial institutions has been completed, with the total restructuring of state-owned capital amounting to approximately $86.01 billion.
Among them, the restructuring of the central financial institutions to carry out the responsibilities of the finance minister has been basically completed.
The restructuring of the central enterprise has reached a certain size.
At the local level, the initial work of the enterprise's relocation has been carried out successively.
At the end of 2018, the pilot work in Zhejiang and Yunnan provinces was basically completed, transferring state-owned capital of $155.8 billion and $188.5 billion respectively.
In addition to the pilot provinces, other provinces have also undertaken preparatory work for the first phase of the relocation, laying the foundation for the next phase of the relocation.
According to a joint notification issued by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the National Commission for the Environment, the General Administration of Taxation and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the central and local redeployment of some state-owned capital to supplement the Social Security Fund will be fully launched in 2019 and will be completed by the end of 2020.
The meeting held on that day made a specific deployment for the overall deployment of the redeployment.
The meeting emphasized the need to complete the restructuring work in a pragmatic and efficient manner.
"According to the progress arrangements, the redeployment will be completed by the end of 2020.
Working time is tight, and tasks are heavy.”
Mr. Liu said that all regions and departments should organize carefully and closely to ensure that the restructuring work is completed as requested; move the work forward firmly, accurately grasp the contents of the restructuring policy; strengthen communication and coordination, and resolve any doubts in a timely manner.
State funding is shifting to reinforcing social-insurance funds – starting with the reinforcing-social-insurance-fund-money-bag, the goal being to provide strong support for pensions.
In my view, however, this is not a simple “physical shift” in equity, but rather a “mathematical addition.”
On September 20, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the State Capital Commission, the General Administration of Taxation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly issued the Notice on the Comprehensive Opening of the Work on the Transfer of Parts of State-owned Capital to Enable Social Security Funds, which sets out a timetable for the transfer of part of state-owned capital to enable social security funds, i.e. the central and local transfer of part of state-owned capital to enable social security funds to be fully opened in 2019.
After the document was published, departments such as the Treasury implemented it quickly.
On September 25, the Treasury transferred 10% of the shares held by the Industrial and Commercial Banks and the Agricultural Banks to the Social Security Fund, with the total value of the two shares exceeding $11.5 billion.
As a financial investor, the undertaking entity, such as the Social Security Foundation, enjoys the rights of profit, disposal and knowledge of the state-owned shares.
In the announcement, Labour and Agriculture Banks stated that the changes in equity rights would not lead to changes in the holding shareholders and actual controllers of the Bank.
In this regard, the author argues that similar state-owned equity devolution is not a simple change in equity ownership, but can trigger a series of effects of “additional operations.”
The first step of some state-funded restructuring of social security is “adding results,” which can, of course, reflect the ownership of state-owned enterprises by all, and the sharing of development outcomes by all.
After many years of reform and development, state-owned enterprises, especially central enterprises, are mostly in important industries and fields in our economy, the overall profitability is strong and more stable.
Among them, the lone-headed enterprises are also continuously realizing to do the best to do the strongest.
On July 10, the Standing Committee of the State Council decided that the work on the transfer of some state-owned capital to supplement the Social Security Fund should be deferred this year.
The Ministry of Finance immediately said that it would work with relevant departments, in accordance with the deployment of the Standing Committee of the State Council, to fully initiate the work of reallocating some state-owned capital to supplement social security funds, fully reflecting the principle of equity between the old-age pension system and the sharing of the results of the development of state-owned enterprises among all.
The second step of the transformation, the “additionary result,” is to strengthen the sustainability of our social security funds and further consolidate the foundations of the pension social security system.
With the ageing of the population, China's social security funds are under pressure, and this time as the transferred subject of state funds, most have the ability to sustain profit and dividend, not only can effectively supplement the social security funds, but also provide the source of living water for the social security funds.
It has been calculated that for every 3.8 percentage points of state-owned capital transferred, the proportion of enterprises' basic pension contributions can be reduced by one percentage point.
The third step of the transformation, the “additionary result,” is to add stabilizers to capital markets.
The way in which the undertaking receives the profits from this restructuring is to "participate in dividends mainly, operations as an auxiliary."
As a financial investor in state-owned capital, hedge funds do focus on earning equity dividends.
However, as a capital market value investor, hedge funds have a strong capital operation capacity.
For listed assets in state-owned capital, the participation of the insurance fund will further optimize the corporate governance structure of listed enterprises, which will help to raise the level of enterprises' operations, and will have positive positive effects on listed companies and capital markets.
At the same time, the rise in equity holdings by hedge funds, as an investment trend, helps to further strengthen their influence in the market and plays a “stabilizer” role in the market.
In addition, it is also beneficial to fully realize the function of "value discovery" of institutional investors, guiding investors rational investment and value investment.
Karl Hartmann entered Leipzig Music College at the age of 18, with a postgraduate degree from Weber.
After the Nazis came to power, Hartmann first resisted in the form of non-German publications, and later even stopped writing.
In 1933, he created Symphony Misrae and dedicated it to “My long-sleeping friends.”
The first symphony took place in Prague in 1935, but was harassed by Nazi officials.
Afterwards, Hartmann decided not to play any of his works under Nazi rule.
Hartmann's funeral concerto was a concerto for violin and strings, the manuscript of which was stolen from Germany and premiered in Switzerland.

U.S. Senate approves Scalia's appointment as Secretary of Labor - wikipedia
WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The United States Senate voted on September 26 to approve President Donald Trump's nomination of Eugene Scalia as Secretary of Labor.
The result was 53 votes in favour, 44 against, and no Democrats voted in favour of Scalia.
Republicans consider Scalia's career to be very suitable for him as Minister of Labour.
But to Democrats, Scalia has long stood in opposition to workers and trade unions in her career as a lawyer.
Scalia will replace Alexander Akosta.
Under enormous public pressure, then-Labour Minister Costa resigned in July this year over alleged sexual assault and kidnapping of a girl by US billionaire Geoffrey Epstein.
At the age of 56, she is a partner in a prominent law firm in the United States, and her father is the late Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia.
The Department of Labor is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. government responsible for labour-related matters.
The White House also issued a statement on the day that Trump had nominated acting Director of the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency, Peter Guner, to formally head the agency.
In accordance with the procedure, Ghana's nomination must also be approved by the Senate.
The Federal Emergency Measures Department, under the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for coordinating the federal government's resources to deal with emergencies and follow-up to natural disasters and terrorist attacks in the United States.
Since the first appearance of the National Day 35th Anniversary Parade, every time a large parade is organized, there is a "massive hegemony" faction of the Strategic Missile Force.
“This National Day Parade is the first time the Rocket Forces have appeared on Long An Street since ‘the soldiers’ changed to ‘the army’.”
Wang Po, head of the rocket-equipment squadron command, said.
The missile-armed forces fully promoted the spirit of special hardship, special fighting, special dedication, rigorous training, scientific group training, the entire training of soldiers reflected three characteristics, demonstrated a good image of the strategic army, and more attention to rigorous style.
Both the general and the soldier in this parade were required by strict standards, forging the heavy winds and forbidding the excessive manner of conduct.
They also pay attention to promoting the craftsmanship, grasping every detail, practice technique, practice perseverance, practice style, forming characteristics such as "Army stands up, moves fast, answers bright," constantly using rigorous style to create each WWE missile battalion, more attention to technological innovation.
The rocket army, as a high-tech strategic army, talks about technology and innovation is a good tradition and advantage.
Based on their previous experience, they broke the paradigm of thinking, broke the traditional method, used advanced methods such as satellite positioning, laser range, high-definition imaging, real-time measurement of speed, and improved training level and quality efficiency, ensuring that the combinement of human vehicles is no less than milliseconds, the battalion operations are no less than seconds, and the standards of actual combat are better.
The rocket-armed paratroopers insisted on the same standards and higher requirements for the paratroopers' fields and launchers' fields, keeping every gate closed, paying attention to every detail, and enabling the paratroopers to be hardened and hammered, making the National Day Paratroopers' Fields a training and examination ground for boosting the forces' fighting power.
Iran confirms development of advanced centrifuges further discontinue implementation of Iran nuclear agreement
Iran's use of advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium has once again violated the Iranian nuclear agreement, the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on September 26, according to the Central Press Agency.
It is reported that Iran is gradually violating the limits of the Iranian nuclear agreement in response to US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the agreement in May 2018, and the resumption and strengthening of Iranian sanctions.
Iran, which suspended two other commitments in July to keep its stockpile of enriched uranium below 300 kilograms and its purity below 3.67 per cent, has now taken further steps.
In accordance with the Nuclear Treaty, Iran could only install about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at the Natanz to accumulate uranium enrichment, and only allow Iran to use a small number of more advanced ones for research, but not to produce uranium enrichment.
If Iran succeeds in developing more advanced centrifuges, it will be able to produce uranium enrichment several times faster, possibly for use in the production of nuclear bombs.
The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that, “On September 25, the Agency confirmed that advanced centrifuges developed by Iran for engines 2 and 3 were either accumulating or ready to accumulate uranium.”
The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented the report to Member States on 26 September, and a diplomatic official responded: “They are busy with the (nathan-enriched) facility.”
The Association of Korean Investors and Entrepreneurs was officially launched.
Chen Hailing, Chairman of the Association of Investors and Entrepreneurs of South Korea, said VKBIA will work together to strengthen relations between the two countries.
The two countries are fighting to increase bilateral trade to $10 billion by 2020.
Mr. Chen Hailing believes that the birth of the Association is an important step towards achieving the above objectives.
He hoped that the Vietnamese Party, the Government and relevant functional bodies in South Korea would assist the Association in its future operation.
The Vice Ambassador of Vietnam to South Korea, Mr. Chen Chang-su, said that VKBIA would create a good platform for the exchange and sharing of experiences and ideas among entrepreneurs of the two countries, aimed at expanding the investment cooperation space, helping each other to make a more effective contribution to Vietnam's economic development and integration into the international economy, and facilitating the flourishing trade relations between the two countries.
At the opening ceremony, the VKBIA representative signed a cooperation agreement with the Vietnam Association of Farmers and Agricultural Enterprises.
VKBIA was born on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Strategic Partnership between the two countries and in the context of the bilateral efforts to strengthen pragmatic cooperation in the fields of diplomacy, defence and security and to promote trade and investment cooperation aimed at achieving the goal of achieving a bilateral trade volume of $10 billion by 2020.
Italian education ministers have proposed a sugar tax to protect public health.
Lorenzo Fioramonti, education minister in Italy's new cabinet and a member of the Five-Star Movement, presented a motion to parliament today proposing a new tax policy for high-sugar-content beverages, snacks and tickets.
According to a motion tabled by Education Minister Paolo Ramonti, the Italian government is reportedly imposing snack tax on health-damaging foods such as sugary drinks and snacks, while imposing a strict environmental tax on airfares, with domestic flights charging €1 and international flights charging €1.5.
The government is expected to receive €30 billion in taxes through a series of seemingly small tax measures, said Fioramonte.
The revenue from the tax will be used for education, health and environmental protection.
In response, Italian Prime Minister John F. Kennedy said he thought it was a viable plan; Italian parliamentarians, European MPs, and Unionist Party leader Silvio Berlusconi derided him by urging everyone to quickly hide sweets, cookies, bread and candy, as the new government was about to start levying snack tax.
The report points out that snack tax generally refers to a special tax on sugary drinks and high-temperature foods.
The levying of the tax contributes to public health benefits.

Baidu Launches First Autonomous Taxi Team
Yesterday, Baidu announced in Changsha, Autonomous Taxi Team Robotaxi trial operations officially opened.
The first 45 "Red Flag EV" Robotaxi vehicles developed jointly by Apollo and I汽红旗 have opened test tracks in Cheungsha for testing.
From now on, ordinary citizens of Changsha can log in to Apollo website to apply to become a seed user, and have the opportunity to experience the ride.
An experienced passenger said he was sitting in the rear row of the vehicle, clicking on the screen in front of the passenger seat, and a button triggered the vehicle's self-driving journey.
In order to ensure the safety of passengers and the requirements of current policy and regulations, the test-driven vehicles shall be equipped with a safety officer at the driving seat to maximize the safety of passengers.
In the course of driving, the vehicle can make intelligent path according to the condition of the road, can also judge the driving condition of the surrounding vehicle, to make automatic escape to the situation of near-distance overpass etc.
During the entire experience, the passenger area screen shows the road conditions of pedestrians, cars, and even some traditional blind areas on the road in real time.
Even if the vehicle is blocked, you can see the red and green lights in front and the waiting time in advance.
Unmanned vehicles used to be seen on TV and thought to be far away from us, but today it feels magical to find it in our lives.
We expect it to really enter the lives of ordinary people in the future.
In June 2019, Apollo was awarded 45 carrying test licenses by the Changsha City Government.
At present, the self-driving test open road in Changsha passes through the sections of Changsha City Artificial Intelligence Technology City, Meixi Lake, Yang Lake, Dao Wangshan, and the High-New Area, totalling 135 kilometers and the area of the demonstration area reaching 70 square kilometers, is the longest distance in China's roads, the largest area, covering the most complex scenery, and the most advanced intelligent driving demonstration area of the road-co-infrastructure.
It is expected that by the end of 2019, the Apollo Robotaxi fleet will cover about 50 km of test roads in Changsha, and in the first half of 2020 it is planned to cover 135 km of roads currently open in Changsha.
The women's winning runner-up remains dissatisfied: it will be difficult to make so many mistakes in a strong team
China's women's volleyball team won 9 consecutive World Cup titles in 2019, defeating the strong Dutch women's volleyball team 3–1.
However, after the game, the coach of the women's volleyball team, Roping, still expressed dissatisfaction with the team's performance in the third round.
“In the third game, the opponent strengthened the attack, and some of us couldn’t hit the ball without being in the strongest position, and we made a lot of mistakes.”
"It's hard to make so many mistakes with a strong team. "
Speaking in an interview after the race.
“We told the players to concentrate, not to be attacked in the first pass, to adjust and play well, and to play defensively with the other side.”
Roping also commented on Zhang Changning's performance, saying that she had some difficulty in attacking, was too quick, too trying to kill the ball, and the move would be deformed.
I hope she is a little more patient, “we all protect her.”
China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.
(New China 70) White Paper: China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.
White Paper points out that China's development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.
With China’s combined national power and international influence rising rapidly, some internationally fear that China will follow the path of “national hegemony,” while others have come up with the so-called “China threat theory,” White Paper said.
This is both a cognitive misreading, a deep-rooted prejudice, and a psychological imbalance caused by the degeneration of power, and a deliberate distortion to maintain the self-interest.
The realization of national prosperity, national revival and people's happiness is both the dream of the Chinese people and the common dream of the peoples of all countries.
“China’s development is an opportunity for the world, not a threat or a challenge.”
The White Paper points out that China is the main stabilizer and source of economic growth in the world, and China is the biggest contributor to economic growth in the world. China's technological innovation injects new momentum into the world's economic growth, and the role of China's future economy as a stabilizer and source of economic growth is even more prominent.
The current economic growth in the world is insufficiently dynamic, and a stable Chinese economy is increasingly important to the world.
China's economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-speed growth, and new kinds of industrialization, informationization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization are being accelerated, economic structures are being deeply adjusted, industrial optimization is continuously upgraded, and new economic growth points are constantly emerging.
“The McKinsey Global Research Institute’s study suggests that by 2040, China’s and the rest of the world’s economies are expected to merge to create $222 trillion to $37 trillion in economic value, equivalent to between 15% and 26% of the global economy, and that enhanced cooperation between the rest of the world’s economies and China will create enormous economic value.”
White Paper emphasizes that China's economy and the world economy have undergone structural changes and are deeply integrated.
China's economic performance is more stable, its growth quality is higher, and its growth prospects are predictable, which is a long-term benefit to the world economic development.
Viewing China’s economic development as a “threat” and a “challenge,” attempting to push China out of the global chains of supply, supply chains, and value chains, to “decouple” China from the world economy, is both impossible and harmful.
White Paper points out that the full-fledged opening-up creates more opportunities for countries to share China's dividend.
China is firmly committed to a mutually beneficial and mutually win-win open strategy, achieving greater intensity and a higher level of openness. China has the most potential consumer market in the world, and it is the most attractive investment destination.
"Openness should be two-way, mutually beneficial, and not one-way, benefiting one party.
Mutual benefit can last for a long time.”
The White Paper says China is committed to continuously expanding imports, liberalizing market access, improving the business environment and strengthening intellectual property protection, and that other countries should also expand openness and take appropriate measures to improve their own business environment.
Only when all sides work side by side can we create an environment of open, inclusive, beneficial, balanced, and mutually win-win development. The bigger the "cake" of development, the larger the mutually beneficial and mutually win-win community.
White Paper points out that China is providing more public goods to the international community.
This includes promoting high-quality building of the Belt and Road Strategy, building multilateral dialogue and cooperation platforms, actively participating in international and regional affairs, and actively conducting foreign assistance.
“China’s development benefits the international community, and it never forgets to provide more and better public goods to the international family.”
Russia wants to strengthen cooperation with China in the economic and trade fields, further optimize export structures and promote diversification of Russian exports to China, Andrey Slepniov, general manager of the Russian Export Centre, said in a written interview with Xinhua News Agency.
The forestry, mechanical manufacturing and chemical industries account for a considerable proportion of Russian exports to China, while agricultural exports are also very important, including oil and fat products, meat products and dairy products, as well as cereals, fish and seafood.
In recent years, Russia's exports of non-material and non-energy products to China have also developed well and stablely.
Speaking about Russia's optimization of its export structures to China, Slepniov said Russia had set itself the task of expanding its exports of high-tech products to meet the import demand for high-tech products in countries and regions around the world, including China.
Russia will further improve financial and non-financial support measures to promote further growth in the number of high-tech enterprises.
"Russia is willing to export construction technology and high-tech building materials to China and to develop cooperation with China in the areas of pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacturing," he said.
Both sides have great potential for cooperation in the field of urban environmental development.
He emphasized that Russia’s products in many areas are “quality superior and price competitive” compared to those in the West.
Speaking about the two countries' goal of achieving bilateral trade worth $20 billion by 2024, Slepniov said agriculture, mechanical manufacturing, chemical industry and forestry would play an important role in achieving that goal.
Russia intends to promote diversification of supply in these areas and exports of deep processed products.
He stressed that Russia intends to push its exporters into the global value-added chain, one of which is China.
Russian manufacturers in the fields of agriculture, metallurgy, oil and gas, and chemicals are fully capable of participating in this process.
Currently, the two countries need to continue to deepen cooperation among enterprises, “to establish more Russian-China joint ventures and jointly develop exports to third countries.”
Slepniov said the Russian Export Centre is taking a variety of measures and services through the Russian Export Credit and Investment Insurance Department and the Russian Import and Export Bank to support the export of Russian products to China.
At the same time, the Russian Export Centre will continue to deepen its cooperation with China's relevant departments to facilitate easier access of Russian goods to the Chinese market and develop new types of exports to China.

The report says London is firmly number one in the world's foreign exchange trade.
In July 2019, London accounted for 40.14 per cent of global foreign exchange transactions, the United States for 12.93 per cent, and France for 7.67 per cent.
Foreign Ministry responds to Taiwan's so-called "diplomatic breakthrough": sneaky self-destructive
China's foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuan, told reporters at a regular press conference on 27 February that the small move was a disgraceful one, laughing at the government.
According to Taiwanese media, officials from Taipei’s New York offices entered the United Nations headquarters to attend a meeting on religious issues in the United States, calling it a “diplomatic breakthrough.”
The meeting you referred to was a side-meeting held by the United States on behalf of the United Nations. It was not a United Nations meeting at all.
Gao said Taiwanese personnel have infiltrated the United Nations in a sneaky way, damaging their personality and rendering it a so-called “diplomatic breakthrough.”
He pointed out that the United Nations had repeatedly reiterated its insistence on dealing with Taiwan in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2758, and that the broader membership of the United Nations had also adhered to the principle of China.

The demonstration is aimed at bringing down the president in Egypt The authorities have indicated a strong repression
Twitter themes and social media are pushing the Egyptian masses to take to the streets today to peacefully call for President Sesi to step down.
But the authorities have indicated that they intend to use force to suppress them.
Since then’s military coup d’etat by the then chief of the armed forces, Sesi, in 2013, the expression of dissent has almost faded in Egypt, and any form of protest would be in extreme danger.
The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, a non-governmental organisation based in Cairo, reported that more than 1,900 people have been arrested since last weekend's rare outbreak of protests demanding Sesi's resignation.
The allegations of corruption surrounding Sesi and his family's waste of public money in pursuit of vanity led thousands of people to take to the streets on Tuesday.
Yesterday, Egypt's interior ministry firmly stated that any attempt to undermine the country's stability would be met with decisive resistance and no soft hand.
Cairo's city centre has been heavily guarded, and the streets around Tahrir Square, the site of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution, are surrounded by riot police, security vehicles, and uniformed police.
Peninsular Television reported that security forces on 25 July detained several prominent scholars and social scientists, including Professor of Political Science at Cairo University and prominent columnist Nafa.
"I have no doubt that continuing to allow Cecil to rule absolutely would be disastrous," he said on 24 April.
“He is in Egypt’s best interests to step down immediately.”
Before Nafar was arrested, Hosni, a spokesman for Annan, the former chief of staff of the Egyptian army, was detained.
Annan was arrested last year after attempting to run for president with Sethi.
The president of the Constitutional Party, Dawood, was also detained.
Analysts and politicians argue that at a time when the economic plight of the poor and middle class is intensifying, dismantling dissidents reflects the instability and fragility of the government.
Says Ayman Nour, the opposition leader and former presidential contender: “The arrests highlight the regime’s indifference to the Egyptian people and its own fears.”
“Because the economy has been screwed up by him, combined with widespread political repression, Sesi is trying to communicate a clear message to the important generals and politicians who might be replaced.”
Norr pointed out that the government's high-pressure tactics would only increase people's anger if the socio-economic situation continued to deteriorate.
Since the barrier of fear has been broken, he expects more people to take to the streets.
Ali, an exiled Spanish businessman and actor who was an Egyptian military construction contractor, began uploading a series of videos earlier this month, pledging to benefit from government corruption and sparked a small-scale demonstration last weekend in different cities.
Ali said his company, Amrak General Contracts, would not have to go through a statutory tender process to get a lucrative contract, emphasizing the corruption of the military and the Sesi family, including First Lady Intissar Amer al-Sisi.
He was deeply repentant of his involvement in it.
Ali claimed that he had helped the luxury palaces and luxury hotels in Seychelles in stark contrast to the current poverty of Egyptians, and that the other side had not paid.
On Twitter, such themes as “Stand up and don’t be lonely”, “Sessie, you’re done,” “Sessie must roll,” and “Next Friday” have attracted tens of thousands of tweets and retweets, appealing to people to take to the streets peacefully and ask Sessie to step down.
The Hollywood Egyptian actor Amarwick's Twitter has nearly seven million followers.
He quoted in Arabic yesterday: “Sesi is doomed to die ... he is done, and those who support him are now making a great mistake.”
Hong Kong Prefecture Launches Free Special Training Scheme to Assist Employees in Recently Economically Affected Relocations
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government announced on 27 July that it is introducing a free special training scheme for employees affected by the recent economic situation. Qualified trainees will receive a training allowance of up to HK$4,000 per month upon completion of the course.
There are very few shops in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui Harbour City.
The recent decline in the number of visitors to Hong Kong has been influenced by the recent social upheavals in Hong Kong, affecting not only the tourism industry, but also the hotels, catering and retail sectors.
The Secretary for Labour and Welfare of the HKSAR and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Cheung Dae-hua, will meet with the media on entrusting the Employee Retraining Board with the implementation of a special training programme and measures to support the tourism industry.
The challenge facing Hong Kong's economy is imminent and should not wait until the situation is calm.
Hence, the HKSAR Government has launched a free training programme called "Special? Love Value-Added".
People who are unemployed or have been granted unpaid leave by their employers as of June 1st will have the opportunity to participate in the scheme as long as they meet the relevant requirements.
Mr Ro said that the scope of the courses was extensive, the most important of which was the training of "professional skills" covering 19 sectors, including tourism, retail and catering, as well as some new "innovative technology" courses and cross-sectoral "general skills".
Employee Retraining Bureau Chairman Yu Peng Chun said all courses are free of tuition fees and the plan is expected to support about 10,000 people in need.
Students who participate in the scheme will receive a special allowance of HK$4,000 per month as long as they complete each full-time or part-time course and attendance rate reaches 80%.
The training course, which will last two to three months and will be offered by some 50 training institutions, will be available to the public daily from 3 October to 31 March next year, with a maximum of four courses for each person, according to the information.
Furthermore, the HKSAR Government has also announced a series of measures to support the tourism industry in facilitating the crossing of barriers.
These measures include the relaxation of appropriations for the Tourism Council, the financing of 6,000 tour guides for renewable courses and the exemption of travel agents from annual fees, etc.
Who is tired of sports is tired of brains?
According to the Russian satellite network, a study of athletes showed that the brain also shows signs of fatigue after high-intensity exercise.
The study, led by Maurice Pesiglion, an expert at the Paris-Salpetre hospital in France, suggests that there is an unclear link between brain-powered and physical labor: both require cognitive control of activity.
“When you need to control pain in muscles and joints, you can force yourself to stop voluntary processes,” explains Pesciglione.
The study was initiated by the French National Institute of Sport and Sports (INSEP).
The school's experts are in charge of coaching athletes in preparation for the Olympic Games.
Some athletes have begun to develop over-training syndrome, i.e. an uncontrollable feeling of tiredness after high-loading exercises, a lack of recovery and a drop in performance.
INSEP asks whether part of the cause of this disease is neuro fatigue, the kind of neuro fatigue caused by excessive brain work.
The study was published in the journal Contemporary Biology.

Making Chinese Citizens "going Out" Safer – Visit to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Choi Ai-min
Wherever you go, the motherland is behind you.
On 25th, the first foreign ministry officials to protect public goods short video launched, the short end of the sentence caused the widespread sympathy of netizens.
Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Choi Ai-min told Xinhua News Agency that the short film aims to further make the citizens feel "diplomatic citizens"' sentiments and temperatures, and to make Chinese citizens feel that no matter where they are in the world, Chinese diplomats will extend their help, strength and hope for them.
Overseas peace is no small thing, one branch is always concerned.
Over the past seven decades, the number of Chinese citizens "going out" has increased dramatically, from less than a million a year before reform and opening up to more than a billion a year today. At the same time, Chinese citizens are safer to travel abroad, and consular protection and assistance work has expanded from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, tourists, international students, and domestic workers.
According to statistics, since the Party's 18th Congress, we have organized more than 10 major evacuations or transfers of Chinese citizens overseas, evacuating more than 40,000 Chinese citizens safely from dangerous and volatile areas.
Approximately 500,000 cases involving nearly one million Chinese citizens have been received and handled in a coordinated manner.
At times of danger, the motherland can take you home; the dream of a “walk by walk” is no longer a dream.
As of the end of August, China has concluded reciprocal visa waiver agreements with 14 countries covering ordinary passport holders, Mr Choi said.
Moreover, more and more countries have unilaterally granted Chinese citizens visa-free entry and landing.
42 countries and territories, such as Thailand and Egypt, have issued landing visas for Chinese citizens with ordinary passports, while 15 countries and territories, such as Indonesia, have issued visa exemptions for Chinese citizens with ordinary passports.
Besides visa waiver and landing, Chinese citizens apply for visas more and more conveniently and procedures are simplified more and more.
By the end of August, China had concluded visa facilitation agreements or arrangements with 41 countries.
These include agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and Argentina on reciprocal tourism, on the issue of 10-year multiple-entry visas for businessmen, and agreements with the United Kingdom on reciprocal tourism, on the issue of two-year multiple-entry visas for businessmen and relatives.
The UK and Belgium have jointly introduced a one-stop visa service, with France, Italy and Singapore reducing the time taken to receive visas to 48 hours, 36 hours and 24 hours, respectively.
For business travellers who are often out of the country, multiple-entry, convenient-for-transit APEC business travel cards are a good choice.
According to Mr. Choi, holding the travel card is equivalent to obtaining a visa from 16 economies around the Asia-Pacific for five years at a time, which is significant for business people, especially private-sector employees, to "go out."
Currently, China ranks first among APEC economies in the number of effective card holders.
The foreign ministry will actively negotiate bilateral visa reciprocity agreements, encourage more countries to take visa facilitation measures for Chinese citizens, translate the results of diplomatic work into benefits for all, and improve the “golden content” of Chinese passports.

The United States will increase its deployment of air defense systems and troops in Saudi Arabia
The U.S. Department of Defense announced on 26 May that the United States would increase its deployment of a Patriot air defense system, four patrol radar systems, and about 200 U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia due to the previous attacks on Saudi oil facilities.

Two months after being detained by Iran, the British tanker "Stannah Empire" was finally released and departed from Iran's port of Abas on the morning of 27 October for international waters.
Just in the middle of last month, the authorities in British overseas territories in Gibraltar had just released an Iranian oil tanker that had been detained for more than a month.
According to the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency, at 9 a.m. local time on 27 September, the British tanker "Stannah Empire" departed from Port Abbas for the international waters of the Persian Gulf.
Ports and shipping organizations in the province of Hormuzgan, Iran, have confirmed that the commanders and crew of the vessel have made formal and written commitments that, despite the detention of the vessel, they have made no claims.
Stena Bulk, the Swedish owner of the tanker, also said the ship was taking off from Port Abbas.
Furthermore, Refinitiv's ship tracking data also found that the tanker began moving on 27 July and left Port Abbas.
The Stena Impero tanker, flying the British flag, was detained by Iran in July this year.
A spokesman for the company said the tanker was preparing to leave Port Abbas.
Two weeks after the British seized an Iranian oil tanker in the Strait of Gibraltar, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker named "Stena Impero" on the Strait of Hormuz.
The ship was released in August.
Earlier this week, a spokesman for the Iranian government said all the legal procedures required for the release of the Sultanate had been completed.
The Iranian side, however, said the investigation was still under way.
Several Iranian media outlets also released videos of the oil tanker's departure.
On 19 July, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards navy captured a British tanker, the "Stannah Empire", in Iranian waters in the Gulf of Hormuz, and then transported it to Port Abbas.
Iran was seized by the oil tanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar.
Furthermore, on 4 July, British overseas territories in Gibraltar seized "Grease 1" oil tankers carrying Iranian crude oil in the Strait of Gibraltar, allegedly for shipping oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.
More than a month later, on 15 August, the authorities in Gibraltar announced the release of “Grace One.”
This afternoon, a conference on the subject of reviewing and reforming the education of undergraduate and higher education institutions in Cheungsha province was held.
Ulan, deputy secretary of the provincial committee, emphasized that it was necessary to improve the political position and strengthen political responsibility, and that it was necessary to review and correct the problems thoroughly and to promote the establishment of political parties, politics and reforms in universities through the effectiveness of the subject education.
Ulaanbaatar fully endorses the initial results achieved by undergraduate universities in the second batch of thematic education.
She pointed out that conducting education on the theme of "Never forget your first thoughts and remember your mission" is a major deployment of the Central Party. All undergraduate and higher education institutions should study in depth to implement the spirit of the high-level speeches on conducting education on the theme "Never forget your first thoughts and remember your mission".
From strengthening the “four consciousnesses,” accomplishing the “two maintenances,” implementing the political high ground of the primary mission, seriously accomplishing the provisions of good subject-education actions, especially the series of issues that have been thoroughly reformed and reviewed, coordinating all activities of school reform and development, and doing “two not mistake two promote.”
Ulan emphasized that he should stick to the knife edge, take a good look at the problems, according to the requirement of "Four Contexts" "Four Find One," match the table to find the right problems, open the way to seek the opinions of teachers and students, staff, parents and the community, seriously seriously analyze the roots deeply, and then clarify the direction of efforts and initiatives to improve, and bring out the real tricks to solve the difficulties.
To insist on accurate power, strengthen real change, practically make the word "change" through all the time.
To make good thematic education and combine the work of "Lide Tree People," etc., tighten up the responsibility for correction, ensure that the problem one does not fall, see the bottom clear zero, and seek the effectiveness of correction.
We must stick to standards and regulations, perfect long-term effective mechanisms, tighten the cage of the system, strengthen the rigid constraints of the system, ensure that all activities have chapters that can be followed, regulations that can be complied with, and really use the authority of the system to govern people.
To insist on the above, leading leaders should lead the strengthening of theoretical armedness, lead the serious review of corrective measures, lead from the strict rule of law, play a good "key minority" demonstration role, and strive to accomplish the tasks of good subject education review of corrective measures.
Statements were made by the comrades in charge of the party committees of five high schools, such as Hunan University, and the comrades in charge of the departmental units directly concerned.
Shipment of Two Large Special High Pressure Projects
On 26th, the ±1100千V high-voltage direct current transmission project from the east to the south of Anhui Province and the Sutong 1000千V AC high-voltage GIL Integrated Corridor project were launched.
Both projects occupy the high point in each field of current world transmission technology and will allow China's energy optimization configuration to be greatly improved after shipment.
Guo Chi, chief economist at the National Energy Bureau, said the project from Yueongdong to Anhui Province is the largest power transmission project in the world and the longest distance to be transmitted.
Its investment is of great significance for promoting the development of Xinjiang energy base and ensuring electricity supply in the eastern part of China.
GIL is a gas insulating metal that closes the transmission line.
The Sutong Pipeline Project has created the world's highest voltage level and the highest transmission capacity record for the GIL Project, and has achieved the highest voltage level interconnection of the China-East Core Grid.
According to the National Grid Company, the transmission distance from the south-east to Anhui Province is 3324 km.
If conventional technology is used, more than 15 per cent of the electricity will be lost in the process, and the project has been aggressively developed to significantly increase the economic transmission distance to more than 3,000 km.
After the project is launched, 100 million degrees of electricity can be delivered every 8 hours and 20 minutes, helping to solve the problem of eradicating Xinjiang's existing new energy sources.
According to full-load estimates, this line alone will supply between 600 billion and 850 billion watts of electricity annually and will meet more than half of Shanghai's annual electricity consumption.
The Sutong GIL Integrated Corridor Project is a controlling project of the special high-pressure exchange ring network across the Yangtze River.
If a conventional overhead line crosses the river, two large iron towers over 450 meters on the banks of the Yangtze River will be required, and an artificial island of over four football fields will be built for each iron tower.
To this end, the national grid boldly innovated and developed a compact special high-voltage interconnection GIL transmission technology that crossed the river from underwater through tunnels and avoided the impact on the golden channel.
The two projects pushed China's electrical equipment manufacturing capacity to realize a new leap.
Currently, the National Grid has built up the "10-way 11-way" high-pressure project, and the "4-way 3-way" is under construction.
Foreign Exchange Bureau: Continuous Optimization of China's Foreign Debt Structure Strengthening the Stability of Foreign Debt
“Overall, our country’s foreign-debt structure is continuously optimized and the stability of foreign-debt is enhanced.”
China's main foreign debt indicators are within the internationally recognized safety line, and foreign debt risks are generally controlled, said Wang Chun-ying, a news spokesman for the National Foreign Exchange Administration and Chief Economist, on Tuesday.
On the day of the Foreign Exchange Bureau's release of data on foreign debt at the end of June 2019, Wang said in response to a question by reporters.
As of the end of June 2019, China’s total foreign-exchange balance (including foreign currencies) amounted to $98 billion, up 1.3% from $263 billion at the end of March 2019, mainly due to the growth in debt securities.
In the second quarter of 2019, more than 70% of China's total external debt growth was driven by non-residents buying domestic renminbi bonds, and the majority of non-residents were mainly medium- and long-term investors such as central banks.
At the end of June 2019, medium- and long-term foreign debt accounted for a 3 percentage point rise compared to the end of March 2019, and foreign debt accounted for a 1 percentage point rise compared to the end of March 2019.
Wang said that as China's renminbi bonds were included in the Bloomberg Global Index in April 2019, international investors continued to increase their holdings of domestic renminbi bonds as recognition of China's bond market rose further.
“China’s international balance sheet remains overall balanced, and foreign debt risks can be controlled.”
Journalists from the Agricultural Academy of Yunnan Province learned on 27th that the grass moth has been effectively controlled and has not caused a large-scale outbreak of plague. The control work has achieved phased results.
In January of this year, for the first time a grass moth migrating from overseas was discovered in Jiangxi County, Er City, Yunnan, and it was confirmed in 129 counties. The grass moth also gradually spread from Yunnan to the mainland of China, posing a direct threat to Chinese food production.
The grass moth is an important agricultural migratory pest originating in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a major migratory pest of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) global warning system. It has the characteristics of "international, migratory, eruptive and destructive".
The insect is harmful to more than 80 crops such as corn, sugarcane, sorghum, and can cause up to 70% loss of yield.
It is difficult to control the insect, and there is no registration of pesticides for the control of the insect in China.
Since the invasion of Yunnan by lawn moths, the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences has appointed a researcher named Zhang Edong to lead the innovation team of the Ministry of Green Control in cooperation with cross-border harmful organisms in agriculture at the Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences. He will go to the front line, conduct field investigations, collect samples and conduct technical guidance and test demonstrations.
The team has initially mastered the species characteristics of the Yunnan grass moth, the resources of enemy insects, the source of insects outside Yunnan, the migration path of the species, the toxicity of pharmaceuticals and the effects of field control.
They have actively conducted research and application of green control technology, implementing new technologies for green control, such as population monitoring, insecticide, scientific pharmaceuticals and agro-technical measures. The effectiveness of green control in the demonstration area has reached more than 90 per cent, while reducing the use of chemical pesticides, protecting natural resources and ecological environment, and providing technical guarantees for Yunnan to effectively control the outbreak of crop moth pests and sustainable management.
At present, Yunnan grassland corrupt moth has been effectively controlled, without causing a large-scale outbreak of disaster, and the control work has achieved phased results.
Next, the University of Agricultural Sciences of Yunnan Province will focus on the development of ecological mechanisms for species migration and invasion outbreaks, and breakthrough the construction of biological control and green control technology system.
At the same time, we are actively promoting cross-border international cooperation, striving for the establishment of joint key laboratories and joint monitoring networks and demonstration areas outside Yunnan in order to enhance the full-fledged monitoring and early warning capability of grass moths in Yunnan.

White Paper: China's exit from a path of national development
China's State Council Press Office released the White Paper "China and the World in the New Era" on September 27.
The White Paper points out that over the past 70 years, the Chinese people have worked hard to explore and pioneer China's Chinese characteristics, successfully paving the way for China's socialism and achieved world-renowned developmental achievements.
White Paper says China's development depends on self-reliance and hard work.
China's development depends on the hard-working spirit of "800 million shirts for a wave", generations of people striving tirelessly and continuously, giving others unimaginable hard work and sweat; on the responsible spirit of "carrying your own burden," whether good or bad, not exporting problems, not transferring contradictions, not buying and selling and plundering other countries to develop themselves; on the exploratory spirit of "crossing the river with stone," not going down the old path of imperialism and colonialism, not following the development model of Western countries, but combining China's practices, summarizing the lessons of experience, drawing lessons from human civilization, daring to try and get out of one's own path.
According to White Paper, China is developing in its interaction with the world, China's development has injected positive energy into world peace and development, and China's path is in line with China's national circumstances and the demands of the times.
China maintains world peace through practical action.
For 70 years, China has not initiated any wars or conflicts on its own, nor has it invaded any part of other countries.
White Paper points out that China's development has achieved enormous success over the past 70 years, and the fundamental reason is that it has found the right path of development with Chinese characteristics and has steadfastly followed it.
This is a road to establish, put the interests of the people first, reform innovation, seek common development in openness, and rule the country in full accordance with law.
China's size is huge, the country's situation is complicated, and the difficulty of governing is rare in the world. Without a united, strong and strong leadership, China will move towards division and disintegration, which will bring disaster to the world.
For 70 years, China has defeated all kinds of risks and challenges, creating one remarkable Chinese miracle after another, White Paper said.
Especially since the eighteenth Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's development has achieved historic achievements and has undergone historic changes, and the Chinese nation has made a great leap from standing up, becoming rich to becoming strong, and is closer than ever in history to the great goal of national renaissance.
China's development path will show more and more bright development prospects as time goes on.

Taiwan scholars say: "Uncertain Times" Taiwanese business needs to keep up with the mainland's development
The 2019 Taiwan Chamber of Commerce Innovation Business Model Forum will be held in Taipei on 26 and 27 February.
The event invited a number of Taiwanese business representatives and scholars to share their experiences on enterprise transformation, innovation, take-up and market development.
The forum was hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Management and co-organized by Guang Yi Jin Ding Securities, the Taiwan Taiwan Chamber of Commerce Association and other organizations.
The two-day meetings were divided into several seminars, including the restructuring model, management strategy, and more than a hundred people attended.
China’s (Mainland China) U.S. trade friction is continuing, and Taiwanese business is facing “uncertain times,” says Chen Ming, president of the Taipei Institute of Business Administration.
He believes that Taiwanese entrepreneurs need to keep up with the times and focus on the main industries that are developing on the mainland, especially innovation products related to technology, culture, tourism and health.
"In the past, Taiwanese traders paid attention to quality, effectiveness and delivery."
Mr. Chen believes that only the above conditions are not enough for Taiwanese businessmen at present.
He pointed out that Taiwanese enterprises should have both speed and service, accelerate supply chain speed, and pay attention to extend service and life product service.
Additionally, "service value-added" is also a new area where Taiwanese business can develop vigorously.
The Taiwanese representative from Guangdong, Chairman of the Taiwanese-based Aami Electronics Co., Ltd., Mr. Xu Wendong, said that Aami Electronics had been operating difficulties due to a sudden drop in orders, and the group was looking to improve its operations from restructuring and activating assets.
Removing the traditional electrical business, transforming the electrical equipment for cars, and entering the smart home electrical industry, it took three years for enterprises to realize profits.
Sunshin (Zhuhai) Electronics Co., Ltd. general manager Bai Hong Zhao suggests that if developing new customers is difficult, it is better to focus on providing "one-stop-shop" services to the original customers.
Customers replace suppliers with six factors: poor service, high price, low quality, slow delivery speed, low variety, and honesty. As long as these six factors are addressed, plus timely modification of production lines and expansion of product portfolios, enterprises themselves will become irreplaceable suppliers for customers.
On 27th, Taipei hosted the "2019 Taiwan Entrepreneur of the Year Award" ceremony, which was also hosted by the Taipei Institute of Business Administration.
According to the Taiwanese daily Economics, Liu Zhao, general manager of Golden Earth, a Shanghai-based operational center, was awarded the “Best Entrepreneur and Cross-Straits Contribution Award.”
New Regulation: Social Capital Needs Qualification to Acquire Rural Land Management Rights
Qualification for Social Capital to Acquire Rural Land Management Rights
Public Consultation on Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Land Management Rights in Rural Areas to Regulate the Transfer of Land Management Rights by Industrial and Commercial Enterprises
Yesterday, the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs issued a notice of public consultation on the Measures for the Transfer of Land Management Rights in Rural Areas (Amendment Draft Consultation) (hereinafter referred to as the Consultation) to increase the supervision and risk prevention of the transfer of social capital, such as industrial and commercial enterprises, to acquire land management rights.
The draft opinion is now open to public consultation.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs stated that in order to implement the newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracts, further consolidate and improve the basic agricultural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land system, implement the system of "three-power allocation," the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs revised the Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Ownership of Rural Land Contracts, and formed the Opinion Paper.
The Beijing Youth Reporter learned of several important changes in the first edition of the Opinion.
The newly amended Law on Rural Land Contracts clarifies the scope of land transfer, implements the concept of "three-power division," sets out "land contract management rights" and "land management rights" respectively, and makes a clear distinction between the transfer, exchange and transfer of land management rights (lease, transfer, shareholding or other forms).
In this draft opinion, in order to implement the concept of "three powers allocation" and effectively respond to the spirit of the reform of the Law on Rural Land Contracts, and taking into account the large differences between the transfer of land management rights and the exchange and transfer of land contract management rights in terms of parties, procedures and supervision, the draft amendment defines the scope of the transfer, focusing on the transfer of land management rights, the way of transfer including leasing, entering shares, etc., the name of the regulation was changed from the Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Land Management Rights to the Administrative Measures for the Transfer of Land Management Rights in Rural Land Contracts.
The transfer and exchange of land contract management rights will be regulated by the administrative measures adopted separately.
The commentary points out that, in the context of the "three-right division," farmers are only entitled to land management for a certain period of time.
In theory, even in the event of bankruptcy settlement, farmers only have the risk of losing the right to operate for a certain period of time, and thus there is a conflict with the Bankruptcy Law by stipulating that the return of the original contractor to the contracted land is legally unnecessary.
In order to prevent the risk of farmers losing land, in practice, the methods of priority shares, pre-lease after shares, repurchase, etc. have been developed.
Considering that the theory of priority shares is already mature in company law, it is suggested that it be an advocacy provision to prevent the risk of loss of equity.
On Monday, scientists at Stanford University Medical School announced they had invented a new diagnostic tool that classifies cells by type: a printable microchip that can be manufactured using standard inkjet printers and can cost about a cent each.

China’s GDP is likely to surpass that of the United States within 20 years.
Tropical Storm Daniel formed in the eastern Atlantic, the fourth storm to be named in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.
The storm was about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, with a maximum sustained wind of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predicted that Daniel would intensify into a major hurricane before Wednesday.
Given that the storm is far from landfall, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.

Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw a terrible scene where people tried to break the window and escape.
People knock on the glass with chairs, but the windows are hard to break.
" At last a piece of glass broke and they started running out of the window," said survivor Francis Cowell.
Stars emit light and heat because hydrogen atoms combine (or fuse) to form heavier elements that generate energy.
Scientists are now working to build a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is a difficult problem to solve. It will take many years before we can see a practical polymer reactor built.
Due to the effect of surface tension, the steel needle can float on the surface.
The cause of surface tension is the strong attraction between water molecules on the surface, which is greater than the attraction between the water molecules and the air molecules above.
The water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water, which allows things like needles to float on the surface.
Modern skateboard knives have two blades, with a hole between the blade and the blade. The two blades have better grip on the ice (even when tilted).
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly bent, when the blade distorts to one side, the edge of the blade in contact with the ice is bent.
In this way, the skater can bend. The knife leans to the right, and the skater turns to the right. The knife leans to the left, and the skater turns to the left.
They must remove the excess energy from light before they can return to the previous energy level.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle called a photon.
Scientists call this process "acute radiation" because atoms are stimulated by strong light, causing the emission of photons, and light is also a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows the atom emitting a photon. Of course, the photon is actually much smaller than in the picture.
The photons are even smaller than the matter that makes up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the wire is eventually burned and the bulb is not lit.
Then you need to replace the bulb. You have to be careful when changing the bulb.
First, shut down the light switch or disconnect the cable connection.
This is because, when the bulb is still partly connected to the socket, when you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb, the current flows into the socket (the connection to the metal base of the bulb), causing you a severe shock.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which is responsible for the blood supply.
The blood flows out of the heart via a pipe called the artery and then back to the heart via a pipe called the vein. The smallest pipe is called the capillary vessel.
The teeth of the triangular dragon can not only bite leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the triangular dragon eats sodium, a common plant during the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like a small palm tree, the crown of which consists of nails-like sharp leaves.
Before eating the trunk, the triangular dragon strips the leaves of the tree with its powerful beak.
Other scientists believe that these plants are poisonous, so dinosaurs are unlikely to eat them, even now that lambs and other animals such as parrots (the descendants of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
What effect does the gravity of Jupiter have on me? If you stand on the surface of Jupiter, you will weigh lighter than you do on Earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on the Earth and weighs about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Jupiter I. So gravity naturally produces less pull on you.
The sun does not stand above the crust like the earth does. The whole sun is made up of gas, fire, and plasma.
The farther away you are from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas is.
What we see outside the sun is called the photosphere layer, which means "the ball of light".
About 3,000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the object and discovered that Venus was in a phase consistent with that of the Moon.
The variation occurs because Venus (or the Moon) is only lit on the side facing the Sun. Venus's variation supports Copernicus' theory that the planet rotates around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
After the reoccupation of the Danelaw region, England experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991, Esselred faced the largest Viking fleet since the Guthrium fleet a century ago.
The fleet was led by Olav Trigvasson, a Norwegian, who wanted to take Norway back from Denmark.
After the initial military failure, Esselred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, and Olaf returned to Norway to attempt to regain the throne, but was unsuccessful.
The Korean alphabet was the only specially invented alphabet for everyday use, invented during the reign of the Emperor of Korea (1418–1450).
He was the fourth king of the Korean dynasty and one of the most respected.
He initially named the Korean alphabet pronunciation table "instructing the people to speak correctly", meaning "to teach the people the correct pronunciation".
There are many sayings about the origin of Sanskrit. One of them is that the Jalians migrated from the West to India and brought their own language here.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that can be compared to Latin in Europe.
The earliest known books in the world were written in Sanskrit. After the completion of the Oyi Book, Sanskrit gradually disappeared due to the system of hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a language of great depth, and is the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the war with France, Germany began preparing for an invasion of Britain.
The Germans dubbed the attack "Operation Lions".The British troops lost most of their heavy weaponry and supplies as they retreated from Dunkirk and suffered heavy casualties.
However, the Royal Navy was much stronger than the German "Kriegsmarine" and could destroy any invasive fleet crossing the English Channel.
Few Royal Navy ships, however, were stationed near potential routes of invasion, as naval generals feared the ships would be sunk by German air strikes.
Let's first explain Italy's plan. Italy is essentially the "small brother" of Germany and Japan.
The country's army and navy were weak, although they built four new ships shortly before the war began.
Italy's main targets are the African countries. In order to capture these countries, they need an army base so that the army can cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To this end, they had to withdraw British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, Italian warships should not have taken any action.
Now look at Japan. Like Britain, Japan is an island country.
A submarine is a vessel designed to operate underwater, and a submarine stays underwater for longer.
Diving boats were used during World War I and World War II, when they were slow and limited in range.
At the beginning of the war, most of them sailed at sea, but as radar development and accuracy improved, submarines were forced to dive underwater to avoid being detected.
German submarines are called U-class submarines. Germans are very good at navigating and operating submarines.
Due to the success of the German submarines, they were unable to maintain a large number of submarines after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as King Tut or Young King, is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings of modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered to be an eloquent figure in ancient times and was not on the list of most ancient kings.
In 1922, however, his grave was discovered and made famous. Although many of the graves of the past were stolen, the tomb was barely destroyed.
Most of Tutankhamun's burials are well preserved, including thousands of relics made of precious metals and rare gems.
The invention of iron wheels made the Assyrian tanks lighter, faster, and easier to drive than the soldiers and other tanks.
The Assyrians used the first army of cavalry a thousand years ago, when they fired their arrows through the armor of the enemy from the deadly crossbows.
Cavalry is the army that fights on the back of a horse. The horse saddle was not invented at the time, so the Assyrian cavalry could only fight on the back of a bald horse.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. The most famous person in Greek culture may be the legendary blind poet Homa, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliad and Odessa.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, whose most famous achievement was the introduction of a famous theorem on the side relations of rectangular triangles.
There are different approaches to the number of people speaking Indian. It is estimated that Indian is the second to fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of native languages depends on whether closely related dialects are included.
It is estimated that the number of people who speak this language ranges from 3.4 billion to 500 million, and that there are as many as 800 million who can understand it.
Hindi and Urdu have similar vocabulary, but the writing is different; in everyday conversations, the two languages can usually communicate with each other.
After the 15th century, northern Estonia was heavily influenced by German culture.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to their countrymen, so they invented the Estonian language.
It adds a letter "Õ/õ" to the German alphabet.
With the passage of time, many foreign words in German were combined with the original ones. This was the beginning of the Enlightenment movement.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne enters the army directly after completing his studies.
Charles, however, enrolled at the University of Cambridge's Third College, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, earning a 2–2 degree (secondary degree).
Charles was the first member of the Royal Family to receive a degree.
Turkey occupies 3% of its territory in parts of Europe (e.g. Eastern Thrace or Romania on the Balkan Peninsula).
Turkey's territory is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,100 mi) long and 800 kilometres (500 mi) wide, roughly rectangular.
Turkey's land area (including lakes) is 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) lie in south-west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) lie in Europe.
Turkey ranks 37th in the world, roughly equal to the total area of the French mainland and the United Kingdom.
Turkey is divided into three maritime zones: the Aegean Sea on the west, the Black Sea on the north, and the Mediterranean Sea on the south.
Luxembourg had a long history, but was not independent until 1839.
Some parts of today's Belgium formerly belonged to Luxembourg, but were transferred to Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 1930s.
Luxembourg has tried to become a neutral state, but it was occupied by Germany during World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist temple located in the upper part of Paro (in the village of Ford).
It is said that Zhabdrung nawang Namgyel built the fort in 1649 to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan army.
In 1951, a fire left only a few remains of Duque fort, such as the statue of Zabrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was maintained and protected, becoming one of the most notable sights in Bhutan.
Cambodia in the 18th century was caught between two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed the gold border in 1772.
In the last few years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighty-eight per cent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and the majority of those employed are non-regular economic workers.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans are in the service sector, nearly one-quarter in industry and one-fifth in agriculture.
Venezuela is a net exporter of oil, and although only one per cent of people work in the oil industry, the oil industry remains an important industry in the country.
In the early days of independence, Singapore Botanical Gardens developed its expertise to help the island become a tropical "garden city".
In 1981, Zhu Jin Wan Dae Lan was chosen as the national flower of the country. It is a hybrid variety of lanterns.
Every year before and after October, about 1.5 million herbivores travel from the northern mountainous areas across the Mala River to the rain-fed southern plains.
Then, after the rainy season in April or so, they returned from the west to the north and again crossed the Mara.
The Serengeti area includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Nature Reserve in Tanzania, Maswa Wildlife Reserve, and Maasai Mara National Park in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional traditional skills, as well as tools in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storyline design, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to reevaluate assumptions about media production and learn nonlinear thinking.
Interactive design requires each component of a project to be interconnected, but can also exist as an independent entity.
The disadvantage of the focal length lens is that, in order to achieve a certain focal length range, the focal length complexity and the number of lens components required are far greater than the fixed focal length lens.
With lens manufacturers reaching higher standards in lens production, this is no longer a problem.
This allows the variable focal length lens to take photographs with the same quality as the fixed focal length lens.
Another disadvantage of the focal length lens is that the maximum focal length (speed) of the lens is usually smaller.
This makes it difficult to use cheap composite lens under low light conditions without flashlights.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert movies to DVD format is overscanning.
Most television programs are produced for entertainment.
For this reason, the screen borders you see on TV, including the top, bottom and side, have been cut.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called "overscanning".
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its borders are likely to be cut off, and if the subtitles in the video are too close to the bottom, the subtitles will be rendered incomplete.
The traditional medieval castle has long been a source of imagination, evoking images of horseback spears, banquets and the knightly spirit of King Arthur.
People, even standing in the ruins of a thousand years, can easily recall the sounds and smells of wars that have passed away, and can almost hear the collisions of the horseshoes on the oak stones, and can smell the smell of fear from the dungeon.
But is our imagination realistic? Why build castles in the first place? How are they designed and built?
As a typical building of that period, the castle of Muxloe was not a real castle, but rather a fortified house.
Its large glass windows and thin walls cannot resist a strong attack for long.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began building the castle, the country was relatively peaceful, with only a small group of looters wandering around defending it.
The balance of power is the system by which European countries seek to preserve the sovereignty of all European countries.
The idea is that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming strong on its own, and therefore governments often replace allies in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession marked the first war on the central issue of balance of power.
This marks an important change, because Europe’s major powers will no longer be able to use religious war as a pretext, and so the Thirty Years’ War will be the last war to be labelled religious war.
On 21 July 356 BC, the arson of Herostratus caused the destruction of the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.
According to the storyline, the man was willing to go out of his way at all costs. The indignant Ephesians declared that the book of Herostratus was out of print.
The Greek historian Strabo later referred to the name, as we know it today. The temple was destroyed the night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander the Great had originally proposed the rebuilding of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Ensure that your hands are as relaxed as possible while still being able to hit all the notes correctly - and that your fingers do not do too many unrelated movements.
This will save you as much energy as possible. Remember, you don't have to push the keys to increase the volume as you do on a piano.
To increase the volume of the windmill, you can pull the windmill more forcefully or at a faster speed.
Mysticism seeks to communicate, identify, or achieve consciousness with ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
Believers seek a direct experience, intuition, or perception of a sacred reality/deity or of Gods.
A follower pursues a certain way of life or practices aimed at nurturing these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because it emphasizes the personal direct experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those of peaceful, insightful, happy, and even enthusiastic state of consciousness.
Sikhism is a religion from the subcontinent of India. It originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region and came from internal sectarian divisions of the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs believe that they believe in a different religion from Hinduism, although they acknowledge that Sikhism originates from Hinduism and includes Hindu traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the way of Gurus". Gurus are the basic components of all Indian religions, but they are particularly prominent in Sikhism and have become the core of Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine Gurus.
However, in June 1956, when the riots of Polish workers protesting food shortages and wage cuts turned into protests against the Communist system itself, Khrushchev’s commitment was tested.
Although in the end, Khrushchev's deployment of the tanks restored order, he made concessions to some economic demands and agreed to appoint popularly welcome Vladislav Gomulka as the new prime minister.
River basin civilization is a Bronze Age civilization located on the subcontinent of northwestern India, covering much of modern Pakistan, as well as parts of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
The civilization of the river basin of India developed prosperously, which is why the civilization got its name.
Although some scholars have speculated that, given the existence of this civilization in the now dried-up area of the Saraswati River, it is appropriate to call it the "Indian-Saraswati civilization", some have called it the "Harapa civilization", named after the first site excavated in the area in the 20th century, "Harapa".
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire promoted the progress and development of medicine.
Emperor Augustus began to recruit doctors, and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps for post-war medical care.
Surgeons are familiar with various tranquilizers, including morphine extracted from poppy seeds and epinephrine extracted from plum seeds.
In addition to blocking blood flow with anesthesia belts and anesthesia pins, they have also been able to rescue anthrax patients by cutting limbs.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire achieved enormous achievements in the field of medicine, which constituted much of the knowledge we know today.
Net paper folding is restricted to one fold only, does not allow reverse folding such more complex operations, and all folding positions must be clear.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who lacked experience in papercutting or had poor hands-on skills.
When children are young, they are aware of ethnic and racial stereotypes that affect their behavior.
For example, if there is a stereotype that a minority child does not perform well in school, the children tend to do badly in school once they understand the stereotype of their own ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million registered accounts.
These sites have received a lot of attention, especially in the field of education.
These sites also have advantages, such as the ability to easily create a class page that contains content such as blogs, videos, photos, etc.
Just provide a URL to access the page easily. This will make it easier for students who do not have difficulty with keyboards or spelling to remember and input.
It can be customized to read, and can also use more or less colors as required.
Attention deficit disorder is a nervous system syndrome in which three typical limiting symptoms include impulse, distracted attention, hyperactivity, or excess energy.
This is not a learning impairment, but a learning disability; it affects "3% to 5% of children across the United States and may reach more than two million".
Children with multiple sclerosis find it difficult to concentrate on things like homework, but they can concentrate on doing things they like, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences with no marks.
These children often find themselves in a lot of trouble because normal methods cannot stimulate their brains, and in order to stimulate their brains, they "act dangerously, fight, challenge authority".
Attention deficit disorder (ADD) affects the relationship between children with the disease and their peers, because other children cannot understand why patients are acting and spelling or why their maturity is different.
The basic rate of knowledge acquisition also changes accordingly when the knowledge acquisition and the ability to learn occur as described above.
The way to get information is not the same. Stress no longer exists in personal memories, but the ability to recall text becomes more important.
The Renaissance fundamentally changed the way in which learning and knowledge spread.
The difference between primitive humans and other primates lies in the fact that they no longer move their bodies with their hands, carry heavy objects, and swing around in the forest.
The size and length of the chimpanzee's feet are similar, reflecting the fact that the hand is used to carry weight while walking back and forth.
Human hands are shorter than feet and fingers (toes) are straighter.
Two to three million years ago, hand-bone fossils have changed from the way they moved to the way they operated.
Some people think that often having artificially induced, clear dreams can be exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that clear dreaming prolongs the time interval between fast eye movement.
The shorter the rapid eye movement period (REM) every night, the less the frequency with which you sleep well and regain your senses, and the more likely your body is to be in trouble.
It's as exhausting as waking up to watch TV every two or three minutes.
The effect depends on how often your brain wakes up every night.
The position of the Italians in North Africa was not ideal from the very beginning.On 10 June 1940, less than a week after the Italian declaration of war, the 11th British Light Cavalry occupied Cape Town, Libya.
In a raid on eastern Batavia, the British captured General Rattusi, commander of the Italian Tenth Corps.
On 28 June, the governor of Libya, Marshal Italo Balbo, the successor of Mussolini, was shot dead by friendly troops while landing in Tobruk.
Modern swordsmanship is divided into several levels: there are levels of university students' initial study, and there are also levels of professional and Olympic competition.
The sport takes place mainly in the form of a fight, that is, a fight between one swordsman and another swordsman.
Golf is a game in which a player throws a ball into a hole with a stick.
A regular round of the game is played in eighteen holes, usually starting with the first hole and ending with the eighteenth.
The winner is the player who finishes the game with the least number of shots or strokes.
The game takes place on grass, and the grass around the hole is cut shorter, known as the ridge.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism that most people think about when they think about tourism: leisure tourism.
This means people go to a place completely different from their daily life to relax and have fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are usually the most visited places for leisure tourists.
If a person visits a particular place in order to understand its history and culture, this type of tourism activity is called cultural tourism.
Visitors may visit different landmarks in a particular country, or may focus on a single area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also demanded reinforcements.
The troops supporting the front line included 200 men from the New Hampshire 1st and 3rd Brigades, commanded by Colonels John Stack and James Reed (who later became generals).
Stark's soldiers stood along the defensive fence at the northern end of the colonists' camp.
As the tide receded, a mysterious river flowing along the northeast of the peninsula opened a gap, and they quickly built a short stone wall that extended to a small beach on the northern edge of the shore.
Gridley or Stark placed a wooden pillar 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no fire to be allowed before the regular army passed.
The United States plans to launch coordinated attacks in three different directions.
General John Cardwald would launch an offensive against the British defenders in the town of Poden, shifting the enemy's attention to prevent any reinforcement.
General James Eugene, with 700 militiamen at the Trenton crossing, captured the bridge in the Bay of Aspen and blocked the enemy's escape route.
The 2,400-strong main force would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton, then be divided into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, in order to launch an offensive before dawn.
From a quarter-mile race to a half-mile race, speed becomes less important, endurance becomes an absolute factor.
Of course, to be a top-notch half-mile runner (running in two minutes), you have to be fast enough and cultivate endurance at all costs.
Exercise in winter cross-country running, plus fitness exercises on the upper half of the body, can prepare well for the running season.
It is not enough just to have proper nutritional practices to produce good performance, but it can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, sticking to the habit of effectively supplementing with moisture, and understanding the various aspects of rational use of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve performance and increase sports fun.
Long-distance running is a relatively low-cost sport; however, participants have a lot of misunderstandings about the few equipments required.
Products can be purchased according to needs, but most products have little practical effect on performance.
Athletes may think that they are inclined to a product, even though it is of no use.
Atoms can be regarded as one of the basic components of all matter.
According to the simplified Boll model, this is a very complex entity, containing a central atomic nucleus that is surrounded by electrons, which are a bit like planets orbiting the sun. See Figure 1.1 for details.
The atomic nucleus is composed of two particles, the neutron and the proton.
The proton has positive electricity, the neutron has no electricity. The electron has negative electricity.
To inspect the victim, you must first inspect the site and ensure your own safety.
When approaching the victim, be aware of his or her position and any unconscious danger signals.
If you want to help someone injured, you just make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and emotions that catastrophic the disease, played an intermediate role in the pain and disability of lumbar pain patients.
Structural exercises on a regular weekly basis are conditioned only by the influence of mind-wandering and not by the influence of depression and fear.
People who participate in regular training need more support in passive perception of pain to help them distinguish between chronic pain and discomfort and normal physical exercise.
The ability to see or see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, namely the eyes.
There are many types of eye structures and their complexity depends on the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different functions, different sensitivities to different wavelengths, and different sensitivities. They also require different processing methods to understand inputs, and different amounts of input to achieve the best effect.
Species refer to the collection of specific species of organisms in a specific geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are completely identical in a particular metamorphic form, they are called monotypes.
When individuals exhibit several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
The migration and settlement stages of the ant colony are also different.
During the migration phase, the marching ant travels at night and stops for rest during the day.
When the availability of food decreases, the ant colony enters a period of migration. During this period, the ant colony builds temporary nests that are replaced daily.
This nomadic cross-country collision lasts about 17 days each time.
The word cell comes from the Latin cella, meaning "small room", originally created by microscopists who observe softwood structures.
Cells are the basic units of all organisms, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
In fact, cells play such a fundamental and critical role in biological research that they are often referred to as "the basic units of life".
The nervous system sends nerve impulses to the whole body to keep blood flowing smoothly, thus maintaining the body's balance.
These nerve impulses can be transmitted very quickly to the whole body, allowing the body to avoid any potential threat of injury.
Compared to other violent storms, tornadoes attacked smaller areas, but destroyed everything on the way.
A tornado can pull up trees, tear down rooftops and throw cars into the sky. Two percent of tornadoes are most violent and can last for more than three hours.
These monstrous storms generated winds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
Humans have been making and using magnifiers for thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were manufactured in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes use a combination of two mirrors to make distant objects look both close and large.
Greed and selfishness are always with us, and the essence of cooperation is that short-term selfishness always brings more benefits when most people benefit
Hopefully most people will realize that in the long run, cooperating with others is the best option.
Many people dream that one day humans will be able to migrate to other planets and explore other worlds. Some people want to know what the universe is like; some people believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
But if this happens, it will probably not happen again for a very long time. These stars are very dispersed, with "neighbouring" stars hundreds of billions of miles apart.
Perhaps one day, your descendants will live in an alien world, guessing what their ancient ancestors lived like then.
Animals are made up of many cells. Animals eat food and digest it in their bodies. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (but not all animals have brains, such as water mothers).
There are animals in every corner of the earth. Some of them crawl underground, some in the ocean, and some in the sky.
Cells are the smallest structural and functional units of all kinds of organisms.
The word cell comes from the Latin cella (meaning a small room).
When you look at organisms under a microscope, you'll see that they're made up of little squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a British biologist, used a microscope to see some of the squares hidden in the cylinder.
They look like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells
Elements and compounds can change their state in the presence of chemical changes.
Gas nitrogen still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The density of liquid nitrogen is greater, but the molecule is the same.
Another example is water. Compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Whether gas, liquid or solid, its molecular structure is the same.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is right around us, affecting everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of research by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars.
The time we experience is a series of events from the future to the present to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration of events.
You can record the flow of time by observing repeated cyclical events. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
Today, we use computers to process pictures and videos.
Complicated animation can be constructed on a computer, and this type of animation is increasingly being applied to television and movies.
When recording music, complex computers are often used to process the sound and mix it together.
For a long time in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Māori, who hunted a large species of bird known as the dinosaur.
The theory then established the view that the Mauritians had moved from Polynesia by "big ships" and had seized New Zealand from the Mauritians and established an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Morioli belong to the mainland Mori ethnic group, who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own unique culture of peaceful worship.
On the Chatham Islands there is another tribe, the Māori, who came from New Zealand.
They call themselves the Morioli. After a few minor conflicts, the Morioli were finally exterminated
Decades of involvement have helped us recognize our strengths and passions while honestly assessing difficulties and even failures.
Listening to others share their personal, family, and organizational stories gives us valuable insights into the past and into some of the people who have had a positive or negative impact on organizational culture.
Although understanding history does not mean understanding culture, it can at least help people understand their place in organizing history.
In summarizing success and failure, individuals and all participants gain a deeper understanding of the organization's values, mission and drive.
In these circumstances, reviewing previous entrepreneurial practices and successes can help keep people open to new changes and directions in local churches.
Such success stories alleviate people's fears of change while creating positive tendencies for future change.
Convergence thinking is the technique of solving problems by combining different ideas or fields to find solutions.
This mode of thinking emphasizes speed, logic and accuracy, as well as fact selection, re-application of existing technologies, and information gathering.
The most important factor in this mode of thinking is that there is only one right answer. You just have to consider two answers, right or wrong.
This mode of thinking has nothing to do with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, can remember patterns, solve problems, and do scientific tests.
So far, human beings have been the best at reading other people's minds.
This means that we can successfully predict the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires of others.
Understanding other people's intentions is critical to these abilities, and we can use these abilities to understand the ambiguities that may be expressed in physical behavior.
For example, if you see someone breaking the window of a car, you're more likely to think that the person is stealing a stranger's car.
If he had lost his car keys and tried to open the door of his car, it might have been a different matter.
Magnetic resonance imaging is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered by Felix Bloch (who works at Stanford University) and Edward Perser (from Harvard University) in the 1930s.
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to emit weak radio signals.
In 1970, medical doctor and research scientist Raymond Damadian discovered the basic principle of using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted, the world's first in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the manufacture of the first "all-body" nuclear magnetic resonance scanner, which he called a "non-resistant".
Asynchronous communication gives people time to think about other people's reactions and react.
This allows students to learn at their own pace and control the rhythm of teaching information.
Moreover, due to flexible working hours, there are fewer time constraints. (Bremer, 1998)
Students can access information on the Internet and the World Wide Web at any time.
Students can also submit questions to the teacher at any time of the day and expect a quick response within a reasonable period of time, rather than waiting for the next interview.
The postmodern learning method brings absolute freedom. There is no one learning method that is a good one.
In fact, nothing requires special learning. Learning behavior occurs when learners experience the presentation of knowledge.
At the moment, we have demonstrated this to all the TV experiences that feature DIY, information display, and learning as the main content.
Many of us find that the television programs we watch tell us about some process or experience, but we never participate in or apply that knowledge.
We'll never have a big car repair, we'll never have a fountain in the backyard, we'll never visit ancient sites in Peru, we'll never have a neighbor's house rebuilt.
Thanks to undersea cables and broadband satellites linked to Europe, the Greenland network is well-connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or host (if you live in a guest house or private residence) may have a Wi-Fi or a connected computer. All settlements have a network bar or a public Wi-Fi location.
As noted above, although the term " Eskimos" is still acceptable in the United States, many non-Americans in the Arctic region, especially Canadians, consider it to have a derogatory meaning.
Although you may have heard the word used by local Greenlanders, foreigners should avoid using it.
In Canada, the indigenous inhabitants of Greenland call themselves Inuit, while in Greenland they call themselves Kalaalleq (multiplyed by Kalaallit), meaning "Greenlanders".
In Greenland, crime and malicious acts against foreigners in general are almost unheard of. Even in towns, there are no "crime hotspots".
Cold may be the only real danger people who are not prepared will face.
If you come to Greenland during the cold season (remember, the colder you go north, the warmer you are).
Long daylight hours in summer can lead to sleep deprivation and related health problems.
In summer, you should also pay attention to the mosquitoes in northern Europe. Although they do not spread any diseases, they may make you uncomfortable.
San Francisco's economy is related to being a world-class tourist destination, but San Francisco's economy is diverse.
The most employment-intensive sectors include professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
It often appears in music, movies, literature and popular culture, making the city and its surroundings famous.
San Francisco has developed a large-scale tourism infrastructure, including several hotels, restaurants and first-class meeting venues.
San Francisco is also a good place to try South Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese dishes in the United States.
For many American families, going to Disneyland is a great activity.
The "typical" play process involves flying to Orlando International Airport, driving to the Disney Park Hotel, spending about a week at Disney and then returning home.
There are many kinds of Disney games, but for most people, "going to Disneyland" is the meaning.
Many of the tickets sold on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are partly used multiple-day tickets.
Although this is a common practice, Disney prohibits it: tickets cannot be transferred.
It is necessary to obtain a camping permit to camp below the edge of the Great Canyon.
In order to protect the Great Canyon, permits are issued on a limited basis. The permits are issued four months in advance on the first day of the month of departure.
Therefore, if the date of departure is May, the field camping permit will be issued on 1 January.
The most popular areas, such as the Phantom Ranch near the Bright Angel campground, usually receive full reservation applications on the opening day.
For unannounced visits, a limited number of permits are reserved and permits are issued according to the principle of first-come-first-served.
Southern Africa is very suitable for driving trips, and tourists can enjoy all the beauty of the region and reach places outside the conventional travel routes.
Normal cars can do this with careful planning, but it is strongly recommended to use a four-wheeler, and in many places only a large axle-distance four-wheeler can pass.
During the planning period, please bear in mind that although South Africa is in a stable state, not all neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and fees vary from country/region to country and can be influenced by your nationality.
There are special laws in each country/region that make provision for emergency items to be placed in the car.
Victoria Falls is a small town in western Zimbabwe, bordering Livingstone, Zambia, near Botswana.
The town is close to the waterfall, which is the main tourist attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers a lot of opportunities for explorers and spectators to stay long.
During the rainy season (November to March), the water levels are higher and the waterfalls are more turbulent.
If you cross the bridge or walk along the winding path near the waterfall, you'll get wet.
On the other hand, precisely because the water is too much, the view will be blocked by the water and not see the entire waterfall!
The Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the valley. Howard Carter discovered the young king's nearly complete royal tomb in 1922.
But, compared to most other royal tombs, the Tomb of Tutankhamun is hardly worth visiting, as it is much smaller and less decorated.
If someone is thinking of seeing the mummy that was damaged when it was removed from the coffin, then they will lose a lot of sight, because they can only see the mummy's head and shoulders.
The vast wealth in the ancient tomb is no longer in the tomb, but has been transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Time-limited tourists prefer to go elsewhere.
The temple was built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Jeroboam, 12 km southwest of Siam.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the scenery of Tonle Sap make climbing to the top of the mountain worthwhile.
You can also take a boat ride to the lake when visiting the attractions.
You need to buy a ticket to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your passport when you go to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries/regions and the United Nations do not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Located on the Judean Hills, the ancient city has a fascinating history spanning thousands of years.
The city is a sanctuary of the three major monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam - and a true centre of spirit, religion and culture.
The religious significance of Jerusalem (especially in many places of the old city) makes it one of Israel's main tourist destinations.
Jerusalem not only has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, but also vibrant, crowded shopping centres, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador provides that Cuban citizens must be admitted to Ecuador through an international airport or border crossing after receipt of an invitation.
The letter must be approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and comply with certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to achieve smooth migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding a U.S. green card should be exempted from the requirement to visit the Ecuadorian consulate.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of departure and you will need a round-trip/trip ticket to prove your stay.
Travel is cheaper for groups of more people. If you are alone or accompanied by only one friend, try to get to know someone else and form a group of 4 to 6 people so that you can get a better per capita price.
However, there is also something to worry about, because tourists are often transported back and forth to fill their cars.
It's actually more like a fraudulent way of making people think they have to pay more money.
This steep mountain, which rises above the hill to the north, often serves as the background for many photographs of the site.
It's a bit scary to look up from below, and it's a steep and difficult climb, but most people in good shape should be able to do it in 45 minutes.
Most of the tracks are paved with stone steps; in steep sections there are cables as supporting handles.
It is said to be breathtaking and to be careful in steep places, especially when the weather is humid, the situation may soon become very dangerous.
You must pass through a small, low, narrow hole near the top.
The best way to visit the attractions and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands is by boat, which Charles Darwin visited in 1835.
More than 60 yachts regularly sail through the waters of the Galapagos Islands (Galapagos) with a capacity ranging from eight to 100 people.
Most people book their seats early (because the boats are usually full during the peak season).
Make sure that your reservation agent is an expert in the Galapagos Islands (Galapagos) with extensive knowledge of all kinds of ships.
This can ensure that your particular interests and/or constraints match with the ships that best suit them.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, northern Chile was ruled by the Incas, while indigenous Aracanians lived in central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last indigenous American tribes to gain independence, and were not fully under Spanish rule until after Chile's independence.
Despite Chile's declaration of independence in 1810 (Spain did not have a normally functioning central government for several years during the Napoleonic Wars), it was not until 1818 that Chile achieved a decisive victory over Spain.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country located in the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, part of the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
In addition to its white sandy beaches and mountain scenery, the country is home to the oldest European-style city in the Americas and is now part of San Dominican.
The first to settle on the island were the Taínos and Caribes, a group of people who spoke the Arawak language and came here about 10,000 years ago.
In the few years after the arrival of European explorers, the Spanish conquerors greatly reduced the population of the city
According to the Tratado de las Indias (Fray Bartolomé de las Casas), between 1492 and 1498, Spanish invaders killed about 100,000 Tatars.
The Union Garden (Jardín de la Unión), once the courtyard of a 17th-century monastery, is the only surviving building of the San Diego Cathedral.
Now it has become a central square, busy day and night.
There are many restaurants around the garden, and free concerts are often held in the afternoons and evenings at the Central Lounge.
Callejon del Beso, which is only 69 centimeters from each other, is a place where an old love legend takes place.
Just give a little bit of money and you can get some kids to tell the story.
Bao Yun Island is a popular destination for day trips or weekends, offering local tours and services such as boat trips, hiking trips, shops, restaurants, etc.
This truly meaningful community is located in Ho Bay, near Vancouver, and can be easily reached by a regular water taxi from downtown Greenville Island.
For those who enjoy outdoor activities, it is necessary to climb Sea to Sky on foot.
For the 2010 Winter Olympics, Whistler (a 1.5-hour drive from Vancouver) was expensive but well-known.
In winter, enjoy some of the best ski resorts in North America; in summer, try some real mountain bike rides.
Permits must be booked in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night in Selena.
Serena is the only forest guard station that provides accommodation and hot meals in addition to camps. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos provide camps only, not catering services.
Parking permits can be obtained directly from the park administration in Puerto Jiménez, but not by credit card
The Park Authority will issue a Park Permit within one month of the expected visit date.
CafeNet El Sol provides reservation services for a fee of $30 and a daily ticket price of $10; see its Corcovado page for details.
The Cook Islands is an island nation in the Free Trade Zone of New Zealand, located in the central South Pacific region of Polynesia.
It is a group of 15 islands, spread over 220,000 square kilometres of sea surface.
Because they are in the same time zone as Hawaii, these islands are sometimes referred to as "South Hawaii".
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before the state, when there weren't so many large sightseeing hotels and other development projects.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but are composed of 15 different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, providing luxury guest houses has risen to a form of art.
In the high-end market, it is obvious that B&B companies compete mainly in two areas: bed and breakfast.
Thus, in such a luxurious place, people often find the most luxurious bed linen, perhaps a hand-made cushion, or a bed for a long time.
Breakfast may include local seasonal dishes or specialties provided by the host.
The scene may be a historically significant ancient building with antique furnishings, tidied grounds and swimming pools.
Getting in your car and starting a long road trip has a simple, pure appeal in itself.
Unlike large cars, you may be familiar with driving your own car and know its limitations.
It is easy to attract unnecessary attention by building tents on private property or any small town.
In short, driving is a great self-driving way, but it's not really suited for camping.
If you have a large, small bread truck, a sports car, a car or a traveler, and the seats are flat, then you can have a car hike.
Some of the origins of the hotel date back to the golden age of steam trains and ferries: before World War II, in the 19th or early 20th centuries.
These hotels were the seats of the rich and famous at the time, and usually had high-class restaurants and nightlife venues.
Traditional equipment, lack of the latest facilities and a taste of the age is also its characteristics.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes provide accommodation for visiting heads of state and other governments.
A frequent traveler might consider flying around the world and staying in a number of hotels along the way.
The Hostel Exchange Network is an organization that connects travellers to local residents of their destination cities.
Joining such organizations usually requires filling in an online form; although some organizations provide or require additional verification.
Subsequently, a paper and/or online list will be provided, listing the remaining vacancies and sometimes indicating the recommendations and evaluations of other passengers.
The beach surfing started in January 2004, when computer programmer Casey Fenton found cheap flights to Iceland but had no home.
After he sent an e-mail to the students of the local university, invitations to provide free accommodation flourished.
Hostels mainly serve young people, young people around the age of twenty are their typical customers, but you can also often meet relatively old people there.
Although there are few families with children, some hostels allow them to stay in single rooms.
Beijing will be the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics and will thus be the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening ceremony, closing ceremony and indoor skating events.
Other skiing events will take place at the Taizo City Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 kilometres (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have annual festivals, beginning at the end of November and ending in mid-May.
Most temple festivals are held to celebrate the anniversary of the temple, the celebration of God's birthday, etc.
Temple festivals in Kerala are extremely interesting, usually with elaborate elephant parades, temple orchestra performances and other festive activities.
The World Exposition (also known as the World Expo) is an international exhibition of art and science.
Participating countries organize art and education exhibitions in national galleries to showcase world issues or their own culture and history.
The World Horticultural Exposition is an exhibition of flowers, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
Although the World Expo can theoretically be held once a year (as long as it takes place in different countries), in reality it is not.
The duration of these projects usually varies from three to six months and takes place on a site of no less than 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. Standard 35mm film (36x24mm bottom film) is the most common.
If the film is finished, it can usually be easily supplied, and the resolution shown is roughly the same as the current digital camera.
Some medium-definition cameras use a 6x6cm width, or 56x56mm film.
As a result, the resolution was almost four times that of the 35 mm substrate (3136 mm2 to 864).
For photographers, wild animals are one of the most difficult objects to photograph. Good luck, patience, experience, and good equipment are indispensable.
Many people are accustomed to wildlife photography, but as with ordinary photography, a picture is more than a thousand words.
Photographing wild animals usually uses long-focus lens, but shooting objects such as birds or microorganisms requires other lens.
Many rare animals are difficult to find, and the parks sometimes have provisions for commercial photography.
Some wild animals are fearful of humans and some are aggressive. The environment may be cold, hot or harsh.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, with more than 5 million users of 20 different languages.
Moreover, written words are often easier to understand than oral ones, especially when describing addresses, as it is often difficult to read them clearly.
In many countries/regions, people all over the country speak fluent English, and in more countries/regions, people also know a little or two English, especially young people.
If you like, imagine a man from Manchester, a man from Boston, a man from Jamaica and a man from Sydney sitting around in a restaurant in Toronto.
They tell the stories of their hometown with their own unique accents and local土語, and make each other happy.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to fill your stomach. If you don't have cooking conditions, you can only choose the ready-made food.
There are more and more types of finished food in supermarkets. Some even offer microwaves or other methods for heating food.
In some countries or in certain types of shops, there is at least one restaurant (usually informal) at a reasonable price.
Make a few copies of your insurance policy and the details of the insurance company and bring them with you.
In order to consult, authorize and claim, they need to indicate the insurance company's mailbox address and international telephone number.
Put a copy in your luggage and save another copy online (by email to send an attachment to yourself, or stored in the cloud).
If you carry a laptop or tablet with you on your trip, store a copy in memory or disk (you can access it without the need for a network).
At the same time, the copies of the insurance contract/contact form will be handed over to travellers and friends who wish to help after returning to the country.
The camels (also known as camels) are naturally non-aggressive, but they can defend themselves if they feel threatened.
Some people don't see camel as a potential danger, and may lean too close to put themselves in danger.
Drink alcohol in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently. It is very important to know your limits.
Excessive drinking can lead to long-term health problems, such as liver damage, and even blindness and death. The potential risk is greater when drinking illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal liquor may contain hazardous impurities, including methanol, even if small doses can lead to blindness or death.
Glasses may be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider having an eye examination in your country (especially if the health insurance can be reimbursed) and then taking the prescription to another place for a mirror.
There may be two problems with high-end brand mirrors purchased in these regions: some may be from Jiangxi, and genuine imported mirrors may be more expensive than those purchased at home.
Coffee is one of the world's largest commodities, and you can probably buy a lot of coffee in your hometown.
Nevertheless, there are many unique ways of drinking coffee in the world that are worth experiencing.
When the stream falls to the bottom of the canyon, the canyon can be dry, or there is deep water.
The streams combine the elements of swimming, climbing, and jumping – but only relatively little training and physical foundation is needed (compared to climbing, diving, mountain skiing, etc.).
Hiking is outdoor activity in a natural environment (usually on a hiking trail).
A one-day hike is a one-day hike with a distance of at least one mile.
Walking along a gentle path for a day requires little preparation, and anyone can enjoy the pleasure of walking as long as their body is not bad.
Families with children may need to make more preparations, but it is not difficult to spend a day outdoors, even with babies and preschoolers.
There are nearly 200 running tourism organizations in the world, most of which operate independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of tour operators across the four continents.
The organization originated from Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, and was soon joined by Prague's Running Tours Prague and other regional organizations.
Before and during your trip, you must consider many aspects.
When you're traveling, please don't expect everything to be the same as at home.Religion, law, food, transportation, accommodation, standards, language, etc. are all different from where you live.
This is something you need to keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even disgust with local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. Travelers who are unfamiliar with the nature, culture and language of their destinations or plan to travel to low-income countries on a journey are generally a good choice.
Although most travel agencies are willing to accept most regular bookings, there are many that specialize in travel of a particular type, a particular budget range or a particular destination.
It is best to find an agent who often reserves similar to your itinerary.
See what travel agencies promote tourist products, you can see on the website or in the shop window.
Whether it's for necessity or to change your lifestyle or to challenge yourself, there are ways for you to do it if you want to spend the least money looking at the world.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either traveling or working, or reducing expenses as much as possible. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who want to sacrifice comfort and time, enjoy a trip full of surprises and reduce expenses to near zero, please refer to the Lowest Budget Travel Guide.
The idea assumes that travellers will not steal, illegally invade, participate in illegal markets, beg or exploit others for private gain.
Immigration checkpoints are usually the first stop after leaving an aircraft, ship or other means of transport.
Some cross-border trains are checked on board; when boarding cross-border trains, you should carry valid identification documents.
In order not to affect the sleep of the passengers on the night-bed train, the driver may collect the passport in advance.
Registration is an additional requirement in the visa process. In some countries, you must register your existence and residence with the local government.
This may require you to go to the local police station to fill out the form or to an immigration office.
In many countries that have such laws, local hotels can register (be sure to ask clearly).
In other cases, only those who live outside the tourist accommodation facility are required to register. However, in this case, the law is very ambiguous, so you need to know in advance.
Architecture is the study of architecture design and construction. The architecture of a place is often itself a tourist attraction.
The appearance of many buildings is beautiful. Whether you look up from a high building or out of a clever window, you will see a beautiful scenery.
Architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design have many overlapping areas.
Due to the fact that many of the Pueblo's inhabitants live very far away, you have to go to Albrecht or St. Daphne to enjoy a rich night life.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above provide drinks, some of which also offer well-known entertainment activities (mainly the large casinos near Albrecht and Santa Fe).
Note: For tourists from other states, small-town bars are not always a good place to hang out.
First, northern New Mexico has severe drinking problems and a high percentage of drivers drinking near small-town bars.
Painting of walls or drawings by hand is known as graffiti.
Although this is not a modern phenomenon, most people are likely to associate it with the use of youth spraying to destroy public and private property.
However, there are now mature graffiti artists, graffiti activities, and "legitimate" graffiti walls. Against this background, graffiti paintings are often more like artworks than hard-to-identify labels.
Throwing back a wand is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw back a torpedo and let it fly out and fly back into your hands, please use a suitable torpedo that can fly back.
In fact, most of the roundabouts on the Australian market don't fly back. It's better for beginners not to try throwing roundabouts in the wind
Hangi refers to cooking in a kiln.
The pits are heated by burning stones, and in some places the ground is naturally heated by using ground heat.
Stone boilers are often used to cook traditional barbecue dishes.
There are several places in Rotorua where hot-burning (hangi) is available, and in Christchurch, Wellington, and other places where it is possible to taste other methods of Maury-burning.
There are MetroRail trains in and around Cape Town, and MetroRail has two levels: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (also known as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable, less crowded, but slightly more expensive, even though it is cheaper than conventional subway tickets in Europe.
Each train has a MetroPlus and a Metro carriage; the former are always near the end of Cape Town.
Carrying Goods for Others - Don't leave your luggage out of your sight, especially when entering or leaving.
You may find yourself being exploited and becoming a drug dealer without knowing it, which will put you in a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in queues, as it is possible to use poison dogs at any time without prior notice.
In some countries/regions, even the first offenders are punished with extremely severe penalties, which may include imprisonment for more than 10 years or the death penalty.
Unsupervised bags are not only the target of thieves, but are also a bomb threat and a source of vigilance and concern for the authorities.
At home, you are more likely to develop immunity to local pathogens as you are often exposed to them.
But elsewhere in the world where you've never seen a bacterial group, you're much more likely to encounter a problem.
Moreover, in warmer climates bacteria can both reproduce rapidly and live longer outside the body.
Then the plagues of "Dry's diarrhea," "the curse of Pharaoh," and "the vengeance of Montezuma" appeared.
Just as cold climates are prone to respiratory problems, hot climates are also prone to intestinal problems. In most cases, intestinal problems are markedly uncomfortable, but not very dangerous.
If you're traveling to a developing country for the first time, or to a strange place, don't underestimate the cultural impact that may arise.
Many emotionally stable and able-bodied travellers have been frightened by the new problems of travelling in developing countries, where they need to adapt quickly to the many subtle cultural differences that follow.
Especially in the early days, you can consider spending more on Western and high-quality hotels, food and services to help you adapt to the environment.
Do not sleep on mattresses or mattresses on the ground in areas where you do not know the local fauna.
If you are going to camp, please bring camping beds or hanging beds so as not to harm snakes and scorpions.
Early mornings at home enjoy a thick coffee, and late nights enjoy relaxing gingerbread tea.
When you're on holiday at home, you have a lot of time on your hands, and you can spend a little more time drinking a special drink to reward yourself.
If you want to keep up-to-date, you can take this opportunity to squeeze some juice or make mixed cheese:
Maybe you'll find a simple drink that you can make for breakfast when you return to regular daily life.
If you live in a city that has a variety of drinking cultures, go to bars or pubs in the streets you don't usually go to.
For those who are not familiar with medical terminology, the meanings of the two words "infectious" and "attackful" are quite different.
Infectious diseases are diseases caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi and other parasites.
Infectious diseases refer to a kind of disease that is extremely easily transmitted in the vicinity of the infected.
Multinational governments have demanded vaccinations for incoming tourists or outgoing residents.
These requirements usually depend on the country the traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the advantages of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it offers many high-quality choices for families.
Residents from other parts of the world often praise family-friendliness as the main reason they move there, and tourists also find it very pleasant to visit the city with their children.
Over the past two decades, child-friendly facilities in Charlotte's upper city have grown exponentially.
Families living in Charlotte usually do not use taxis except in exceptional circumstances.
More than two passengers are required to pay extra, so this option may be more expensive and unnecessary.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, surrounded by Antarctica.
Travel costs are high, health requirements are high, and tours are limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea from November to the summer of the following year.
In the summer, more than forty bases here will welcome thousands of staff, most of whom will be in the area; a small number will stay over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a deserted plateau, covered by 2-3 thousand meters of ice.
There are occasionally specialized air travel groups to inland travel, participate in mountaineering activities, or to large bases in Antarctica.
The South Pole Traverse (or highway) begins at McMurdo Station in the Ross Sea and runs straight to the South Pole point for 1,600 kilometres.
The snow was squeezed, the gaps filled, and the flags marked. Only a special tractor and a sleigh loaded with fuel and supplies could pass.
The car was not very flexible, so it had to go through the Antarctic Mountains and turn a long, big bend to get to the plateau.
The most common causes of accidents in winter are wet roads and road surfaces (walkways), especially stairs.
At least you need proper footwear. Summer shoes are usually very slippery to walk on ice and even some winter shoes are in short supply.
The sole should be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 in) or more; the material should be sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
Some shoes have shoelaces; and there are extensions designed for wet and slippery roads with shoelaces, suitable for most shoes and shoes, which can be mounted on heels, or on heels and soles at the same time.
Shoes should be low and wide. The road is often covered with fine sand, sandstone or salt grains (calcium chloride) to increase friction.
Snowfall is not an unusual phenomenon; the amount of snow that can be absorbed on a steep slope is limited, and the excess snow falls in the form of a snowfall.
The problem is that the snow is very viscous, so it needs some triggering factors to make it snow, and some of the snow that falls can also trigger other snowfalls.
Sometimes the initial trigger is caused by the sun warming the snow, sometimes by more snowfall, sometimes by other natural events, but more commonly by human factors.
A tornado is a very low-pressure rotating cylinder that can suck up and down the air around it.
Tornadoes generate strong winds (usually 100–200 miles per hour), which throw heavy objects into the air and wrap them around to move forward.
At the beginning, the leaky clouds stretched downwards from the thunderstorm clouds, turning into tornadoes when they touched the ground.
A personal VPN (virtual dedicated network) program is an excellent tool to circumvent political censorship and commercial IP geo-filtering.
The reasons why they are better than web agents are as follows: They reroute all Internet traffic, not just the content of the hypertext transfer protocol (http).
They usually provide higher bandwidth and higher quality services. They are encrypted and more difficult to monitor.
Media companies, for example, lie to hide their purposes, claiming it was to "prevent piracy".
In fact, regional code has no effect on illegal copying; a copy of a disk that is copied one by one can be played smoothly on any device that can play the original disk.
The real purpose is to make these companies better able to control their markets; everything is to make money.
Since calls are made via the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located in your home or travel location.
There is no requirement to obtain a local number in the community you live in; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wilderness of Alaska and then select a number that shows you are in sunny Arizona.
Often, you have to purchase a globally available number individually in order to receive calls from a public exchange telephone network (PSTN). The source of the number has a significant impact on the caller.
Real-time text translation applications: applications that can automatically convert entire texts from one language to another.
Some of these applications even allow users to translate foreign characters from their smartphone to signs or other objects in the real world.
The translation engines have improved considerably and now often provide more or less correct translations (and in many cases there are fewer misspellings), but it should be noted that they may still be completely wrong.
One of the most outstanding applications of this kind is Google Translation, which can perform offline translations after downloading the required language data.
When traveling abroad, using a smartphone GPS navigation application may be the simplest and most convenient way to navigate.
It saves more money than buying a map with GPS or an independent GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company.
If your phone does not have a data connection or is not within the service range, the performance of your phone may be limited or you may not be able to use the phone.
Every little shop on the street is filled with an astounding array of prepaid phone cards, which can be used for public payphones as well as for regular phones.
Although most phone cards are suitable for calling anywhere, some cards offer special discounts when dialing to certain countries.
These services are usually obtained by dialing a telephone number, and most phones can dial the serial number free of charge.
The rules for conventional photography also apply to video, and may even be more applicable.
If you're not allowed to take photographs, you don't want to shoot videos anymore.
If UAVs are used, please carefully confirm in advance what can be filmed and what licenses or additional licenses are required.
It's a bad idea to fly drones around airports or crowded areas, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Few people now book directly through airlines without first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the price of the same flight may vary considerably from one website to another, so it is useful to compare the search results before booking and also look at the airline's own website.
While short-term visits to some countries do not require a visa for tourism or business trips, the time spent there is usually longer than for leisure travellers.
Normally, a long stay abroad requires a visa in advance.
Student visas usually have different requirements and application procedures compared to ordinary travel or business visas.
In most countries, you will need an admission notice for the school you want to attend, along with proof that you have funds for at least the first year of the course.
Advise schools and immigration offices in the country where you want to study to learn more about the requirements.
Unless you are a diplomat, work abroad generally requires you to pay income tax to your country/region.
The structure of income tax is different from one country to another, and the tax rate and tax grade are also very different.
Some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, impose federal and local income taxes, so rates and levels may vary depending on the region.
When you return to your home country, there is usually no need for an immigration check or just a walk-and-go form, but crossing the customs may be a problem.
Make sure you know what you can carry, what you cannot carry, and declare any objects that go beyond what is permitted by law.
The easiest way to start travel writing is to practice your skills on a senior travel blog site.
Once you are familiar with online editing and editing, you can create your own website.
Volunteering on a trip is a different way of doing things, but it's not just about giving.
Living abroad and volunteering is a good way to get to know different cultures, get to know new friends, get to know yourself, exercise the ability to make good judgments, and even acquire new skills.
It's also a good way to save money and stay longer, because many volunteers work by providing lodgings and some work with a small amount of pay.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea. Some of these routes are still accessible. It may be difficult to apply for special permits if you need them.
The Strait connects the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, most of which are rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it may be reached from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Please rest assured that when you arrive at the harbor, everything will be fine. You will meet other people who want to board the ferry and they will share their information with you.
Basically, you can post notices, tell others you can help, walk up and down the dock, contact people cleaning boats or sailors in bars, and so on.
Try to communicate with as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you, and they will tell you which ship is looking for someone.
You must be careful to choose your airline from the Alliance's frequent flyers.
Although you may think it's natural to be a member of the airline with the highest number of flights, you should know that the benefits offered by the airline are often different and that other airlines in the same alliance may return more frequent flyer points.
The airlines such as United Arab Emirates, Atihad Airlines, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa, providing flights to many major African cities, and are more competitive in price than other European airlines.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has been able to reach 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If your travel time is plentiful, please see the comparison of the total fares to Africa with the global travel fares.
For all regions outside Africa, do not forget to add additional visa fees, departure taxes, ground transportation and so on.
If you just want to fly around the world within the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is very limited because there are few transatlantic routes.
The southern hemisphere does not have a single airline alliance that can cross all three oceans (there is not even a transocean alliance).
However, Star Alliance covers all routes worldwide, except for the Southeast Pacific route from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti Island, which is the route of South American Airlines (LATAM), a global airline.
If you don't want to cross the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, there are other options besides this flight. (See below)
In 1994, the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis.
With the support of Armenia, a new Republic was born, which, however, has not been formally recognized by any State (including Armenia).
Diplomatic disputes in the region continue to exacerbate relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century old town around Binnstad, Amsterdam.
Due to its unique cultural and historical value, the entire region is listed as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the property value of the area ranks among the highest in the country.
Five fishing villages (Cinque Terre) are five small coastal villages in Liguria, Italy: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
For centuries, people have carefully constructed ladders on the steep terrain, which stretch to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm lies in the lack of obvious business development. Villages are connected by roads, trains and boats, and cannot be reached from outside by car.
The French languages used in Belgium and Switzerland are somewhat different from those used in France, although they are very similar and mutually intelligible.
Specifically, French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has some subtle peculiarities in the digital system, unlike French spoken, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss learn standard French in school, so even if you use standard French metrics, they can understand it.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture, which means "Hello".
However, in Malaysia, at least in rural Malays, the gesture is similar to the one in some Western countries where the food finger moves towards the body, indicating "come" and is used only for this purpose.
Similarly, when waving goodbye, British tourists in Spain may misunderstand that it is a gesture to ask someone to come back if they are waving to themselves (not to the person who is about to wave).
Auxiliary languages are artificial languages or constructed languages that are created to facilitate the communication of language-incompatible groups.
They are different from the general language. General language is a natural or gradually formed language which, for various reasons, becomes the main means of communication between other language users.
At the hottest hours of the day, travelers can experience a delusion formed by water (or something else) - the sea mirage.
Travelers chasing the mirage of the sea will be very dangerous, because it will waste precious energy and the remaining water.
Even in the hottest deserts, the night becomes extremely cold. Without warm clothing, hypothermia is a real risk.
Especially in summer, if you decide to walk through the rainforest, you need to be careful about mosquitos.
If you are driving through subtropical rainforests, the few seconds in which the doors are open when you enter the car will be enough for mosquitos to come in with you.
A bird flu, or more formally a "poultry flu pandemic", can affect both birds and mammals.
It is reported that fewer than a thousand cases of avian influenza have been reported in humans, but some of them are fatal.
Most cases originate from people who interact with poultry, but birdwatchers also have a certain risk.
The typical landscape of Norway is steep canyons and valleys suddenly turned into large, little or no rough hills.
These highlands are often referred to as "vidde", meaning a vast, open space without trees, an immense area.
In Angola and Agadez, they are commonly referred to as "hei", meaning a wilderness without trees, usually filled with rocks south.
The glacier is not stable and flows down from the mountains. This leads to cracks and ice cracks, which can be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice holes may collapse and cracks may close.
On the edge of the glacier, huge chunks of ice will loosen and fall, and may jump or roll farther away from the edge.
Tourist seasons in mountain resorts are usually in the summer of India.
Winter, however, has a different beauty and charm, with plenty of snow in many mountain resorts that offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines dropped offer fares for the funeral, which was a little cheaper than a temporary trip to the funeral.
Airlines offering such fares include Canadian Airlines, American Airlines, German Hansa Airlines (for flights originating in the United States or Canada) and West Jet Airlines.
In any case, you must call the airline directly to book your flight.
"We now have four-month-old mice without diabetes, but they've had the disease," he added.
Dr. Ehud Ul (Professor of Medicine, Dartmouth University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Professor of Clinical and Scientific Affairs, Canadian Diabetes Association) reminded that the study was still in its early stages.
Like some other experts, he doubts whether diabetes can be cured, pointing out that the findings have nothing to do with people with type 1 diabetes.
On Monday, Sarah Daniels, secretary-general of the Swedish Academy's Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, announced on a programme on Swedish Radio that the committee had abandoned attempts to contact Bob Dylan, informing him that he had received the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature, as it was unable to contact him directly.
"At the moment, we're not keeping up with the troops," said Daniels. "I've phoned and e-mailed his best associates and received very friendly responses from them. That's enough for now," he said.
Previously, Ring CEO Jamie Simenov said he could not hear the doorbells in his garage studio when the company was founded.
He said he made a WiFi doorbell.
Simonov said the company's sales grew sharply after his appearance on the 2013 show The Smart Winner, when the show group refused to invest in the startup.
At the end of 2017, Simonov appeared on QVC TV sales channel.
Ring has also reached an out-of-court settlement in court with rival ADT Insurance.
Although an experimental vaccine appears to reduce the death rate from Ebola, no drugs have yet been clearly proven to treat existing infections.
An antibody cocktail called ZMapp (multi-antibody cocktail) was initially expected to play a role in the field, but official studies have shown that its effects on death prevention are somewhat inconclusive.
In PALM experiments, ZMapp is used as a reference. That is, scientists use it as a baseline to compare the other three treatments.
The US Gymnastics Association supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and accepts the strict demands of the Olympic family to create a safe training environment for all athletes.
We agree with the U.S. Olympic Committee's statement and its suspension, rather than continuing to push for meaningful change within our organization, which may be more conducive to the interests of athletes and clubs and their sports.
According to an independent study supported by the American Gymnastics Association, we may be able to find out why the large-scale sexual assault by the survivor, Larry Nasal, which was bravely exposed, has not been detected for so long. Moreover, the Association says it will make necessary and appropriate corrections.
The US Gymnastics Association and the US Olympic Committee have a common goal of ensuring the safety of gymnastics and other sports as much as possible, enabling athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and supportive environment.
In the 1960s, Brzezinski first served as an adviser to John F. Kennedy, and later served in the government of Lyndon Bens Johnson.
During the 1976 presidential election, he provided advice on foreign policy to Carter, and subsequently replaced Henry Kissinger as National Security Adviser (NSA) from 1977 to 1981.
As a national security adviser, he helped Carter deal with many international issues, including the signing of the Camp David Agreement in 1978; the normalization of US-China relations in the late 1970s; the Iranian Revolution that led to the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
The film starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone received nominations for major awards.
Gosling and Stone were nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively.
Other nominations included Best Film, Best Director, Best Photography, Best Clothing Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Composition, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Editing, Best Mixing, and Best Original Script.
The film's two songs, "Following the Fool's Heart" and "Starlight City," won Best Original Song Nominations. Lion Gate received 26 nominations, more than any other studio.
Later in the week, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a statement through his press secretary announcing that the U.S. would withdraw from Syria.
Trump issued a statement after talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The statement said Turkey would also take over the surveillance of captured Islamic State militants; European countries refused to send them back.
This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs have feathers – a theory that has been widely circulated – but also provides details that fossils often cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional alignment.
Scientists say the animal's feathers are chestnut-brown at the top and shallow or carrot-coloured at the bottom.
This discovery also helps to deepen understanding the evolution of bird feathers.
The feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed main trunk, which is known as the feather axis, but there are other features of the feathers, such as feathers and feather branches, and researchers suggest that the evolution of the feather axis may be later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used to fly, but to regulate temperatures or to show off. Researchers believe that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows mature feathers, not juvenile feathers.
The researchers believed that although it was a young dinosaur's tail, the specimen showed adult feathers rather than the feathers of the juvenile.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and wounding more than 20 others.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were policemen.
Police said they suspected a suspected Islamic State (ISIL) militant had launched the attack.
They found that the operating principles of the Sun and other stars are the same: the activity of all stars in the galaxy is entirely determined by their luminosity and rotation.
The Rosebee number of a star is determined by its luminosity and rotation, and is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rosebee number, the less active the star is in magnetic field reversal.
On the way, Iwasaki encountered trouble in many occasions.
He was kidnapped by pirates, attacked by mad dogs in Tibet, escaped from marriage in Nepal, and was arrested in India.
The 802.11n standard runs on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies.
It is backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual wireless.
802.11n is much faster than previous technologies, with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.
Duval is married and has two grown-up children, but he doesn't impress the storyteller Miller much.
When asked to comment, Miller said, "Michael said a lot at the hearing ... I was preparing, so I didn't know what he was saying.
"By 2020, we will strive to bring GDP emissions down significantly from 2005," Hu said.
He did not set a reduction, but merely indicated that the amount would be determined by the output of China's economy.
Hu encouraged developing countries "not to go back to the old path of pollution before governance".
He added, "However, they should not be required to undertake obligations beyond their developmental stages, responsibilities and capabilities."
The Iraq Study Group submitted its report at 12 noon today, GMT.
The report warned that no one can guarantee that any action currently taken in Iraq will stop sectarian wars, escalating violence, or heading towards chaos.
The report begins by calling for an open debate and consensus on US policy in the Middle East.
The report strongly criticizes almost every aspect of the administration's current policy towards Iraq and urges immediate change of direction.
Among the 78 recommendations in the report, the first recommendation is to take new diplomatic action by the end of this year aimed at protecting Iraq's borders from enemy forces and rebuilding diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries.
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the current senator and First Lady of Argentina, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, 50 km (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.
Ms. Kisnell announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine National Theatre, where she began her campaign as a representative of Buenos Aires Province in 2005.
The debate began with controversy over the expenditure on relief and reconstruction after Hurricane Katrina, which some financial conservatives humorously referred to as the "New (Orlean) Bush Administration".
Liberals' criticism of the reconstruction work focuses mainly on the practice of granting reconstruction contracts to people viewed as inside Washington.
More than 400,000 people went to Rome to attend the funeral.
For funerals held in St. Peter's Square, there are too many attendees, so it is impossible for everyone to enter.
Several large television screens were installed throughout Rome for people to watch the ceremony.
Many other cities in Italy and other parts of the world, especially Poland, have set up similar facilities for mass viewing.
Historians have criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation's past policy of concentrating resources on cases that are easily stolen, especially car theft, with the sole aim of increasing the agency's success rate.
Congress began funding the clean-up initiative with 2005 funding and required the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to appoint 10 detectives to deal specifically with adult pornography.
Robin Uthappa scored the highest score in the game, throwing 11 fours and 2 sixs, winning 70 points with only 41.
Midfielders Sachin Tandurka and Rahul Dravid showed colour, and the team achieved 100 runs.
But after the captain lost the three-pillar goal, India scored only 36 points at the end of the game, losing seven of the three-pillar goals.
U.S. President George W. Bush arrived in Singapore on the morning of 16 November to begin a week-long tour of Asia.
He was welcomed by Singapore's deputy prime minister, Huang Gang-sen, and discussed trade and terrorism issues with Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hong-long.
After a week of unsuccessful mid-term elections, Bush told his audience about the situation of Asian trade expansion.
On Tuesday, after a 25-minute meeting in his office with New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton, Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed to refer the government’s Clean Air Act to a multi-party committee for review and then rereading.
"Layton, during his meeting with the prime minister, demanded amendments to the Conservative environmental bill, and he demanded a 'complete overhaul' of the Conservative environmental bill.
Since the federal government intervened in the acquisition of funds for the Mercy Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania, the state government and some federal lawmakers have criticized the move as a stunt before the November federal election.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters go into a small compartment and put a pre-printed piece of paper showing the candidate in the envelope.
After the official has verified the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope into the ballot box and signs it on the ballot book.
The French electoral law lays down fairly strict rules for the electoral procedure.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes had to be transparent so that voters and observers could see that there were no envelopes in the boxes at the beginning of the voting period and that no one else had entered the boxes except those voters who had been counted and had the right to vote in time.
Candidates can send representatives to observe each stage of the election process on the spot. In the evening, volunteers count votes according to specific procedures under close supervision.

The behavior of lions is very similar to that of wolves or dogs. These animals are astonishingly similar to lions (but different from other large cats), and they are also very deadly for their prey.
Tigers are all-powerful athletes, and they can climb (although they are not very good at climbing), swim, and leap, and have five times the power of a human giant.
The tiger and the lion, the leopard and the tiger belong to the same type (the leopard family).The four big cats are the only cats that can scream.
The tiger's roar was not as deep as the lion's, but more like a whisper of anger.
Leopard cats like to eat small animals. If conditions permit, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Leopard cats are almost much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that leopard cats track and search for predators by smelling and sniffing their tracks on the ground.
Their night vision is strong, they can see clearly in the dark, and their actions are very secret. The way leopard cats feed is to integrate into the surrounding environment first, and then to rush to the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small group) separates from their original main group (e.g., they cross mountains and rivers, or they arrive on a new island so that it is impossible for them to return easily), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so new species will need different characteristics or adaptive abilities to become a strong competitor, rather than what they previously needed.
The original populations have not changed at all, and they still need to adapt to the environment as before.
As time passed, new species began to adapt to new environments, and they began to become less and less similar to other species.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two groups eventually look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process "species formation," i.e. the formation of new species. Species formation is the inevitable result of evolution and is an extremely important cycle in evolution.
Plants can produce oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans breathe.
The plants work together to obtain nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
We make houses out of plants, we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Canglong was the top predator of that era, and he was not afraid of anything other than his own kind.
Its long lower jaw is filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and a row on its upper jaw, which means there is no escape from anything it encounters.
Its tongue may be forged, we are not sure yet. Its food includes turtles, large fish, other crabs, and even humans.
It attacks anything that enters the water; even giant dinosaurs like the giant dragon are not its opponents.
Although most of the food of the Romans is common to us, they do have some strange or unusual banquet dishes, including wild pigs, cockroaches, snails and a rodent called the hazel sleeper
Another difference is that the poor and women eat in chairs, and the rich like to gather together for a party and eat side by side.
Several centuries later, food from America or Asia to Europe could not have appeared in the diet of the ancient Romans.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten chicken.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, and regarded it as the abode of the gods.
People offer sacrifices to God, and the priests meet God's needs through rituals and celebrations.
Each temple has a courtyard open to the public, and a courtyard in which only the priest can enter.
Some special towers in the shape of a pyramid, called a pyramidal god tower, were built as part of the temple.
The tower is the special sanctuary of God.
In a warm climate in the Middle East, houses are not so important.
The Hebrew family lives mostly outdoors.
Women cook in the yards; the shops are actually open counters facing the streets. They build houses with stones.
There are no large forests in Canaan, so timber is very expensive.
Greenland has few smokers. According to the Nordic historian Saga, Eric the Red-haired was expelled from Iceland for murder, sailed west, found land, and named it Greenland.
But no matter what he found out, the Eskimos had already lived there.
Although they all belonged to Scandinavia, there were many differences between the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Icelandic peoples, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie National Treasures, you might think that the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map on the back.
However, the fact is not so. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence was written backwards in the style of "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776".
Although no one is sure who the author is, the large woolen paper document (size 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) is said to have been rolled up and stored when it was first written.
Therefore, it is likely that the symbol is only added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained un liberated.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who reached a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940, not against the aggressors, but with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an offensive known as the Operation Dragon Cavalry.
In just two weeks, American and French forces liberated southern France and turned to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by people (society) who live together and work together.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis" (meaning "citizen"), which is related to the Latin "civis" (meaning "citizen") and the Latin "civitas" (meaning "city" or "city state"), which in some way defines the scale of society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. Civilized culture means that knowledge is passed down from generation to generation, that the footprints of culture remain, and that culture can spread fairly.
Ethnic minority cultures often disappear without any relevant historical evidence and are not regarded as similar civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen States initially formed a weak central government under the Federal Ordinance (the Congress was its only component).
Congress does not have the power to levy taxes, and because there is no state administration or judiciary, Congress can only rely on the state government to enforce all laws, and the state government often does not cooperate.
It has no power to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
These provisions had to be amended with the unanimous consent of all the states, and the attitude of the central government was so slow that its state representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team were the second most successful teams in the world, winning the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordsmanship, football, cycling, ice hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, where Italians participate in international and Olympic competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island nation in the world!
Because of the large number of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to from the geological point of view as the "Island"
Western knowledge of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who travelled there named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan and began to change the way in which indigenous peoples produced food, and hired Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) controlled the western and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885, the Great Qing Empire declared a province in Taiwan.
In 1895, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Maguan Treaty, ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, and Japan ruled Taiwan until 1945.
The ancient city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window House, respectively.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the group have been rebuilt in order to give visitors a better understanding of the original appearance of the group.
By 1976, thirty per cent of the hills were repaired, and the work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static image photography format in the world is the 35mm format, which was the dominant film size at the end of the film era.
It is still in production today, but more importantly its length and width ratio is applied to the format of digital camera image sensors.
The actual size of the 35 mm format is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, so the format is a bit confusing.
Thus, the width and height ratio of this format (with the exception of the simplest integer ratio of 12) is 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format series) are similar to or quite close to this length ratio.
Often misused and ridiculed, the three-step method is a simple guide to creating dynamics, but it also keeps the image in order.
It points out that the most effective position for the subject is to divide the image vertically and horizontally into three cross-points of lines (see example).
During this period in European history, the already rich and strong Catholic Church was under close supervision.
Although European countries have different languages and customs, Christianity has been linking them together for thousands of years.
From the king to the civilian, the power of it spreads over ten sides and affects everyone.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary funds are specifically designed to do so.
The centralized church system in Rome has existed for thousands of years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they have adhered to this doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began to impose a maritime blockade on Germany.
They have cut off vital military and civilian supplies, a strategy that has proved to be effective, despite the fact that such a blockade violates universally accepted international law established under several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mines in international waters, preventing any ship from entering entire waters, and even threatening neutral ships.
Because the response to this strategy is limited, Germany expects a similar response from its unrestricted submarine war.
In the twentieth century, the mainstream attitude of most citizens was peaceful and separatist.
After witnessing the atrocities of the First World War, countries longed to avoid a repeat.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he arrived in the United States, he carried four cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
The different periods of ancient China have their own characteristics; each period of China or each family in power is a distinctive dynasty.
Likewise, the periods of successive dynasties were a period of instability between the smaller states. The most famous of these was the sixty-year tripartite period, which lasted between the two generations of the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods of turmoil, the princes fought fiercely for the throne.
Three countries are one of the bloodiest eras in Chinese ancient history. Thousands of people died to compete for the highest power in Xi'an's luxurious palace.
There are also many social and political influences, such as the use of metric units, the transition from authoritarian to republican, nationalism, the belief that the state belongs not to the sole ruler but to the people.
Furthermore, after the revolution, the civil service was open to all men, which gave the most ambitious and successful people the opportunity to fly to Dakota.
The military, too, because the ranks are no longer based on ranks, but on skill.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in many other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside the realm of dust, and he used to go to a cave called the Hill of Noor (light) to meditate.
The cave itself, not only survived the test of time, but also brought an extremely vivid image of Muhammad's spiritual intentions.
The cave sits on a mountaintop in northern Mecca, completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, even knowing its existence, it is not easy to find. Once inside the cave, it is completely isolated from the world.
Nothing can be seen except the clear and beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and in the caves you can hardly see or hear the sights and sounds of the outside.
The Giza pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands.
The Great Pyramid is an Egyptian masterpiece of the 3rd century BC and is one of many large pyramids to pay tribute to the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also known as the Giza pyramids) in the Valley of Egyptian Death comprises several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small graves, several temples, and large lion faces.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate the Hushai pharaoh, and several smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to commemorate Hushai's wife and family members.
The upper bow symbol is like the letter V, the lower bow symbol is like a nail nail or a missing square at the bottom.
The upper finger begins to push the bow from the top, and the lower finger begins to pull the bow from the base of the bow (that is, the place where the bow is held).
The upper bow usually makes a softer sound, while the lower bow makes a stronger, firmer sound.
Please make your own marks with pencils at will, but remember that the notes you print are musically meaningful, so they should usually be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antoinette and their two children (Marie Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris by a group of merchant women from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a group of people who threatened the king and the queen screaming.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of the carriage completely.
In the face of the frightened Queen, a mobster once waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses incurred by American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover most of their expenses, as well as interest on bonds issued by Wall Street Bank in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the long-term exploitation of the high profits earned by the Filipino people became the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights of the Temple, one must understand the background to the formation of the Knights of the Temple.
The period of events is usually referred to as the Middle Ages of European history, i.e. the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 BC).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, and it is commonly assumed that the Late Middle Ages ended around 1500 BC.
Technical determinism is a term that in practice encompasses many kinds of thinking, including technology driven theory, technology necessity theory, and a strict definition that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with the laws of science and their expression in technology.
Most explanations of technology-decision theory include two general ideas: firstly, the development of technology itself far exceeds cultural or political influence, and secondly, technology in turn produces an internal "influence" on society that is not constrained by social conditions.
For example, one might say that cars will inevitably promote road development.
However, it was not economically feasible to set up a national road network for a small number of cars, and new production methods should be introduced in order to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
Higher car ownership also leads to higher road traffic accidents, which will push the invention of new medical technologies for repairing wounds.
Romanticism has a strong cultural deterministic color, which stems from writers such as Goethe, Fischer and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and with the passage of time, customs and cultures related to geography appeared, and these customs and cultures because of harmony with the place where society is located, are much better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is known as the fashion capital of the European feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 BC and continued until around 1100 BC.
Its status declined in the twentieth century, mainly because gifts such as silk and spices from the Crusaders' return were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the fame of the city of fashion shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries.
Initially, dress was influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the delay in cultural exchange, Western fashion may be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages came to an end, the people of Western Europe gradually developed their own style. One of the greatest advances at that time was the introduction of knitted clothing after the Crusades.
Self-sufficiency farming is the production of agricultural activities that only meet the food needs of farmers and their families.
Self-sufficiency farming is a simple and usually organic system that uses local seeds preserved in the eco-zone and combines them with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in self-sufficient agricultural production, which is still the case in many developing countries today.
Asian culture brings together people who are sympathetic, who feel that they are ignored by social standards, and Asian culture cultivates a sense of identity among them.
Given the age, ethnicity, class, position and/or gender differences of the members, subcultures may be distinctive.
It may be a combination of language, aesthetics, religion, politics, gender, geography, or a variety of factors that makes subcultures unique.
Members of sub-cultural groups often symbolize their membership by using unique styles of conduct, including fashionable clothing, manners, and black speech.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to use the case of a few unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, have not been socialized in the course of their growth with the help of adults.
Some of these children are confined to people (usually their own parents); in some cases, they are abandoned because their parents refuse to accept their children's serious intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or injury before being abandoned or left home.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some live alone in the wild.
If a wolf is raised entirely by a non-human animal, its behavior (within the limits permitted by physical conditions) is very similar to that of the animal, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While the project learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, the framework learning method goes further.
Supported teaching is not a learning method, but a means of assisting people who are just learning to use a new computer program or start a new project.
It can be done online or offline. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding teaching, just like Microsoft Office's rotating needle assistant.
Virtual support encoding is used in software to question, suggest, and explain programs that may be difficult for students to handle on their own.
Children are adopted for all kinds of reasons, including neglect, abuse and even rape.
No child should grow up in an environment without parenting, without caring, without education, but it is contrary to wishes.
We think the orphanage system is a safe haven for these children.
Our institutions should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable medical care.
An orphanage system should provide all the necessities that its indigenous families lack.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet add an additional dimension in terms of applications and ways of satisfying.
For example, "learning" and "interacting" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James, 1995).
In studying the audience's response to the site, Emma and Mike (1998) also used "personal involvement" and "permanent relationships" as new motivational factors.
The use of video to explain micro-expressions (continuous facial movements of several milliseconds) has brought significant discoveries.
Specifically, it is said that it is possible to judge whether a person is lying by correctly reading the facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President’s Speech, points out that people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still accurately judge whether a speaker is honest.
He even suggested that this ability to understand human behavior might be a common trait among animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two sources of genetic variation: apparent and invisible.
The mutation adds new mutations, and the selection removes the mutations from the expressed gene pool.
Due to separation and reorganization, variations occur between the two libraries of each generation.
In tropical grassland, primates have a digestive system similar to that of humans, and existing plant resources are difficult to meet primate demands for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so would have serious consequences: growth inhibition, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources are proteins in leaves and bean plants, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest such proteins unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, white ants, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, containing all the necessary amino acids.
Overall, we should not be surprised if the way our ancestors solved the protein problem is no different from the way chimpanzees now use it on tropical grassland.
Sleep disruption refers to the process of waking up intentionally during normal sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to do this by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up if you're not fully awake.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm when you're asleep, you can put the alarm on the other side of the room and force yourself down to turn the alarm off.
Other choices based on biological discipline include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea – known to be beneficial to urination) before sleep, and forcing yourself to urinate.
The degree of inner calm of a person is the opposite of the degree of physical and mental tension.
The lower the stress, the more active the life force is. Everyone is likely to find absolute calm and contentment.
Everyone can reach the boundary of enlightenment, and the only obstacle to achieving it is our own nervousness and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded through the universal love of Buddhism and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes the methods of Kundalini yoga, meditation and universal love.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, chanting, and visual imagery.
The core activity of Tibetan meditation is Tian Yuga. By imagining different gods, purifying the energy channels, activating the rotor holes, thereby reaching the boundary of perception.
Germany was the common enemy of the countries of the Second World War, which promoted cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, institutional, procedural and cultural conflicts further divided the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies are now enemies, and the cold war begins immediately.
The war lasted for 40 years, and the proxy troops fought lively on many battlefields from Africa to Asia, including Afghanistan and Cuba.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive line had been defeated and the only hope left was to withdraw and rearrange troops along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Treaty of Non-Invasion of the Soviet Union and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties, and after the invasion of the eastern part of Poland, more than 80,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and set up positions in Belarus and Ukraine.
To date, shipping has been the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the sea.
In the traditional sense, the task of the navy is to ensure that the State maintains its ability to transport personnel and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport its personnel and goods.
One of the most remarkable modern examples is the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II, when Americans tried to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, dominated by U-boats, attempted to intercept the transport.
If the Allies had failed at that time, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just as it had conquered the rest of Europe.
The sheep appeared to have been domesticated for the first time in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to domesticate them, consume and use their milk, meat, hair, and skin.
Domestic sheep are usually reared in groups on mountains or other pastures, usually under the care of shepherds (mostly children or teenagers), similar to the more well-known shepherds. These methods of grazing are still in use today.
Britain built freight roads as early as the 16th century.
Although the Mara track cars were only made of parallel wooden boards, at that time, on a slightly rough road, these cars could make the carriage horses run faster and pull more.
The rail pillow was introduced very early on to fix the railway. However, people gradually realized that if you put a piece of iron on the railway, the railway would be more stable and effective.
This has become a common practice, but iron blades make wooden wheels harder to wear.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full iron track came into being.
The first known mode of transportation was walking.Two million years ago, with the advent of Homo Erectus, human beings began walking upright.
Their ancestors, the southern monkeys, had no habit of walking upright.
Bipedalism was discovered in southern ape fossils from 420,000 to 390,000 years ago, although the Chadian Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 700,000 years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally, join the environmental movement, and even become environmental activists, to some extent reducing future catastrophes.
This is very similar to symptom therapy in many cases, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it completely.
It is obvious that the world has undergone great changes as a result of human scientific and technological advances, and that the problems have been exacerbated by population surpluses and human luxury lifestyles.
The draft, signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary-General Charles Thompson, was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, and was then sent to the John Dunlap Printing Company outside several blocks.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, the now well-known Dunlap broadsides.
On July 8, John Nixon publicly read the document in the courtyard of the Independence Hall for the first time.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and Washington read the letter to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The remaining 25 Dunlap broadsides were the earliest available versions of the document. Handwritten manuscripts were not retained.
Many ancient biologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and have survived to this day, the so-called birds.
Many people think that they are not dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds still resemble dinosaurs in many places.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a dragon.
Today, almost all input computers are based on processing binary coding information.
A binary number can only be one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and such a number is called a binary number, i.e. a "point" in computer terminology.
Body poisoning may not appear immediately, and symptoms such as vomiting are very common, so there is no immediate diagnosis.
The most powerful indication of the intake of toxic substances may be the container that is opened on the spot and contains drugs or household toxic chemicals.
Check the labels on the drug and get specific emergency guidelines.
Entomologists use the word "bug" to formally refer to this kind of insect.
The term is derived from the familiarity with the insect, which is a very adaptive parasitic insect to humans.
Hunting rodents and odor insects are nesting insects that adapt to live in nests or homes of hosts.
There are about 40,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in various parts of the United States, a disease that has become a major nervous system disease in adolescents.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide not to have children because of their own interests or the interests of their children.
These couples may have adoptive plans for their children.
In the process of adoption, the adoptive parents terminate their rights as parents, so that the other couple can raise their children.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods, which, in fact, can provide guidance for most scientific research.
Experiments are experiments that eliminate one or more hypotheses of possibility, but experiments are not the only method. Problems and observations can also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all subjects of science (including psychology) are accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West left its roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many physiological and behavioral patterns observed by the researchers are largely dependent on the cycles and existence of the inner life generated by the biological clock.
Cyclic rhythms are not just simple reactions to external cycle signals. These rhythms are recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining swinging device that, even without the outside indication, will continue a period of free movement for some time.
Hershey and Chase's experiments demonstrate that DNA is one of the main evidences of genetic material.
Hirsch and Chase use phagocytes or viruses to insert their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, one on the DNA of the phage using radioactive phosphorus, and the other on the proteins of the phage using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations produce a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in reproductive cells inherited from children, while mutations in other cells caused cell death or cancer.
The natural scenery tourism industry attracts tourists who are interested in the natural areas, who come to see the natural scenery including wild plants.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and ecosystem research.
For example, in Borneo, visit, film and learn about red chimpanzees.
Every morning, people drive away from towns and villages to work, and the places where they work along the road with the people who walk past them are where they leave.
In this dynamic transportation shuttle, everyone is in some way connected to and supported by a private car-based transportation system.
Today, science has shown that such a large-scale carbon economy will no longer allow the biological circle that has supported human evolutionary development over the past two million years to remain stable.
Everybody is a part of society and uses the transportation system. And almost everybody complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or similar levels of bridge collapse.
Why do traffic systems cause such complaints? Why do they break every day? Is it a disqualified traffic engineer? Or is there a more fundamental reason?
Traffic flow studies the movement between drivers and vehicles at two points, and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because it is not possible to make 100% definite predictions of drivers' behaviour.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior is often within a reasonable range of consistency; therefore, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency, which can be expressed roughly in mathematical terms.
In order to better represent traffic flow, the following three main characteristics are established: (1) traffic flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are helpful in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects are the earliest animals to fly in the air. The ability to fly makes it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have an advantage of folding their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them more small space to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards are dragonflies and dragonflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Some people think he's right, but many people disagree; they think that the Solar System revolves around the Earth and the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel itself moving, does it?
The Amazon is the world's second-longest and largest river, with a volume of water eight times that of the second-largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with some sections up to 6 miles wide.
The Amazon accounts for 20% of all river flows in the world.
The Amazon Basin is 6387 kilometres (3980 mi) long and draws water from thousands of smaller tributaries.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids lasted until the end of the ancient kingdom, the gigantic size of the Giza pyramids and the high-technology construction have never been exceeded.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period marveled at the monuments of their forefathers, which are thousands of years old.
The city of Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and regulations and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in the country, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It has been known for a long time that basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper can be found in the natural world in natural form and are more easily extracted using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that anything consists of one or more of the four elements of soil, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (not separated in sequence): solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas, but he also proposed the theory that they would be transformed into new substances that make up what we see.
Alloys are essentially made of two or more metals. Don't forget, there are many elements on the element cycle table.
Calcium, potassium and other elements belong to metals, silver and gold are of course also metals.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements (such as carbon).
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that they can contain billions of atoms at the end of the sentence.
So, once the pencil came into the world, it became the heart of many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, pencils have become less and less used.
People now write information on a computer screen without ever having to touch a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what the end of the keyboard will be when a new product appears.
The working principle of a fission bomb is as follows: It requires energy to fuse a nuclear nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a dumb little pushcart up a mountain. Separating the atomic nucleus again and releasing some energy.
Some atoms contain unstable nuclei, which means that they are likely to fissure with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.
The shell below the dark surface is thinner, the shell below the high ground thicker.
Because the crust is thinner, the nearest side may have more darkness, and the lava is easier to rise to the surface.
The core of the theory of incentive content is to find the factors that identify or generate interest.
These theories suggest that some needs and/or desires are internalized when people mature to a certain degree into adulthood.
These theories study why some people want to do what they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do some things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's demand hierarchy theory and Herzberg's dual factor theory.
In general, there are two types of behaviors when managers begin to lead past colleagues. One is that they work hard to maintain "close relationships" with team members.
Managers of this type find it difficult to make unpopular decisions and there are difficulties in implementing discipline measures, evaluating performance, allocating responsibilities and investigating responsibilities.
In another extreme, the person becomes a completely different individual, thinking that he/she must change everything that the team does and take the results for granted.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the success or failure of a team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leadership and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members often serve as contact points for the corresponding offline team.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, because their teams may schedule meetings for different timescales, and local managers may not understand this.
The existence of a true "hidden team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" means the management team that each member reports to. It sets standards for all members.
Why does it take so long for an organization to build a learning organization? One of the objectives of putting the concept of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
Creativity and creativity occur when all available resources are effectively utilized among the functional sectors of an organization.
As a result, in the process of overcoming obstacles together, an organization often brings new innovation processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture of innovation, share knowledge, and learn organizedly.
Angel (2006) explains continuum programming as a way to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical methods of cognitive research, thus reducing the scope of research and making research more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior can support research by scientists.
We knew long ago that different types of brain damage, trauma, disease and tumors can affect human behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies enables us to see and study the structure and working processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build our simulation models and help us understand how the brain works.
Artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction color, but it is actually a very important branch of computer science, studying machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence (AI) research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include the ability to control, plan and schedule, respond to customer diagnosis and customer problems, as well as hand-written identification, voice and facial functions.
All of these have become independent disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, and some home computer and video game software applications already have built-in artificial intelligence systems.
Field visits are an important part of any teaching activity. Usually, teachers are happy to take students to places where buses cannot reach.
Virtual field exploration is a high-tech solution. Students can watch artificial objects in museums, visit aquariums, or admire exquisite artworks in class.
The virtual sharing of field visits is also a good way to review the tour and share experiences with the next class.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their state visits. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are stored online and used as clipboards.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although the grammar and spelling used by students when they start to write are often awkward, the appearance of readers often changes the situation.
Students are often the most discerning readers, so bloggers begin to work hard to improve their writing and avoid being criticized.
In addition, blogging "musts students to have more insight into the world around them," which encourages them to become smarter and more interesting to the audience.
Blogging is a tool that can stimulate cooperation and encourage students to extend learning beyond traditional school classes.
"The proper use of blogs can make students better at analyzing and thinking; by responding positively to online material, students can find their own positions in contextual contexts of other people's articles and present their own views on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa, Canada's capital, is a charming and bilingual city, highlighted by a series of art galleries and museums presenting Canada's past and present.
Then to the south is Niagara Falls, to the north is the Muskoka River and the undeveloped natural beauty opposite the river.
All of this makes Ontario the typical Canadian that foreigners think of.
Further north the vast area of people smoke scarcely, some places are wilderness without smoke.
An astonishing set of demographic data contrasts: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is even greater than that of Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located on the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island to date and is still an independent continent for wildlife.
Smaller islands are mostly independent states, or belonging to France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the land, a doctrine that prevails in the countries of Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Town route from Europe to India.
The north borders the Sahel region; the south and west approach the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is suggested that all female tourists should say they are married regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but don't wear a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to the harassment they think they are experiencing; and there are many cases of being followed, grabbing their arms, and so on.
Be firm when rejecting a man, and don't be afraid to stand up for your position (no matter what culture, you have to decide to renounce it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was built by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the Merenid.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it, and named it Casa Branca, until it was abandoned after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya. Spanish merchants established a trading base here and named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting shopping spots in all of Morocco.
Near the old town of Macedon, there are shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as Tajik pots, pottery, leather, tobacco and all kinds of toys, but these shops are targeted at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located to the east of the country, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Niragongo volcano, which covered most of the town's streets, especially the town centre.
Despite the fact that Goma is still safe, investigations should be conducted in advance in any place outside Goma in order to ascertain whether the ongoing fighting in North Kivu has slowed down.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo and the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking project in Africa.
You can visit Goma on a boda-boda. The normal (local) price for a short journey is 500 Congolese francs.
In addition, because of its remoteness, Tinbaktu is used as a metaphor for a distant alien countryside.
Today, although Tinbaktu's fame makes it a tourist destination and has an airport, it is a poor town.
In 1990, due to the threat of deserts, it was placed on the World Heritage List.
It is an important spot in Henry Louis Gates' special on the American Public Broadcasting Corporation's Wonders of the African World.
The city contrasts sharply with other cities in the country, because it is more of an Arab style than an African style.
Krug National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and is divided into 14 different ecological areas, providing support for different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the main tourist attraction of the South African National Parks System (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park collects maintenance fees and ticket fees every day.
There are many advantages to buying a Wild Card. With this card you can enter some or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the nickname of the Hong Kong area, and is also the focus of many tourists.
The many buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline look like a shining stripe and are particularly striking in the reflection of Victoria's waters.
If you want to enjoy Hong Kong's beauty from the best angle, you can leave the island and go to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on the north coast's landfills.
This is where the British colonists occupied, so if you want to look for evidence of this colonial history, this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal redwood forest, 80 km (50 mi) long, stretching from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. This part of the forest in India is known as the Sundarbans National Park.
However, these forests are not just redwood swamps, but also remnants of large jungles that once filled the Henghe plain.
The area of Sunderland is 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one-third is watershed/沼泽 area.
Since 1966, Sunderland has been a wildlife sanctuary, with an estimated 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 deer.
Buses run from intercity bus stations (cross rivers) throughout the day, but most buses, especially those to the east and Jakal/Bumdan, run between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance given the frequent crowding of inter-city buses.
Most of the areas can be reached by a comfortable and solid Japanese Coaster bus.
To get to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punta (Nu 200), sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way.
The Ohio River Bridge is a slope bridge across the Ohio River that connects the Brazilian state of Ohio to Saint George in French Guiana.
The two bridge towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and have two 3.50 metres wide lanes.
The project was completed in August 2011 but did not commence traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are the most important indigenous groups living in the present-day eastern part of Paraguay, and they live in semi nomadic hunting and self-sufficient agricultural activities.
The Chaco area is home to other indigenous tribes such as Guaycuru and Payagua, who live by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay was known as the "Grand Province of India", a product of encounters between Spanish conquerors and indigenous communities.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the construction of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has tried to preserve many of the local features and characteristics of the city.
Argentina is famous for having the world's top horse team and players.
The largest annual tournament takes place in December at the horse court in Las Cañitas.
On other days of the year, there are also smaller championships and competitions.
To learn more about the championship news and how to buy tickets, please visit the Argentine Horse Club website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound, which is equal to the pound.
The only bank on the island where money can be exchanged is in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
Pounds are generally accepted in all parts of the island, and in Stanley they can often be paid by credit card and in dollars.
Credit cards may not be available on the outskirts of the island, but can be used in British and American currencies; please contact the owner in advance to confirm the accepted payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the island, so you have to do it before you leave the island.
Montevideo is located south of the equator, so the northern hemisphere is summer when it is winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; in summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter may be cooler than it looks: the temperature is barely below zero, but when wind and humidity combine, it feels cooler than the temperature on the thermometer.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons here: rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to humans, wild animals are after all wild animals, and we should not feed them or disturb them.
The park managers say that bears and wolves should be kept at least 100 yards per meter, while all other wildlife should be kept at 25 yards per meter!
No matter how gentle it looks, almost all large animals, such as cattle, moose, camels, bears, and so on, are likely to attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured for not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so please leave them some space.
Additionally, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that spreads smells, and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is situated on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to leave the bay.
In addition to one British cruiser, the remaining ships sank. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
A peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the death of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III during the struggle for independence organized by the Maoist Movement.
Oakland crosses two ports, so there are many beaches in the area. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The North Coast Beach (in the North Harbour area) is located in the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are here, swimming is safe, and most places have the shade of New Zealand Christmas trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Whitemata Harbour, in the high-end suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Oakland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with holiday homes and various shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the "I" beer. Its taste is not complicated, but it is good to drink and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be bought here, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be more difficult to transport.
Local indigenous water can fully meet safe drinking standards, but if you're still worried, you can easily buy bottled water.
For Australians, the concept of "fresh white" coffee is even more unfamiliar. A small cup of black coffee is "condensed coffee," and Cabbage's cream (not foam) is stacked up high, and the tea does not match the milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juice is expensive, but of good quality.
Many people travel to the Great Barrier Reef all year round, and there are few injuries due to any of the above activities.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to follow the advice of the relevant departments, observe all signs and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
The box-shaped mothers appear from October to April of each year near the beaches and mouths of the towns of 1770 and occasionally at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim.
The main habitat of the saltwater crocodile is not the ocean, but the northern mouth of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking can make the traveler feel safe knowing that there is room to spend the night after reaching the destination.
Although travel agencies may be able to help you with reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping, they usually work with specific hotels.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport pick-up, and some even offer packages for flights and hotel accommodation.
If you need time to consider whether the price is appropriate or if you need to obtain other documents (such as a visa) to reach your destination, they can reserve a reservation for you.
If any modifications or requests are required, they should be dealt with first through travel agents, not directly with the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on the scene, and the vast majority of participants believe that this is an extremely important part of the festival experience.
If you want to see the performance from a distance, you have to get up early and take your camp near the stage.
Remember that although the music on the main stage may be over, the rest of the festival may be playing music until midnight.
Some music festivals set up special campgrounds for families with children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, because sailing on the ice surface brings very dreadful noise to those most affected.
St. Petersburg cruises include sightseeing activities in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see Terms of Service for details).
Casinos usually try to spend as much time and money as possible on their guests. Casinos usually don't have windows and clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually provide special food, beverages and entertainment activities to keep guests happy and stay at the casino.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are provided free of charge. However, drunkenness can weaken judgement, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying awake.
Anyone who drives or crosses mountains at high latitudes should take into account the possibility of snowfall, ice or freezing temperatures.
On the snow-covered road, the friction is very low, and you can't drive like on a clean tarmac road.
When it snows, the amount of snow in a very short time can be enough to trap you.
Snow, drifting snow, bubbles or ice on the windows of cars may also block your eyesight.
On the other hand, ice and snow weather is very common in many countries, and traffic is almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Hunting may be Africa's most attractive tourism activity and the highlight of many tourist trips.
The word safari is commonly used to refer to traveling by land to admire amazing African wildlife, especially on tropical grassland.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) tend to be closer to cars, and standard equipment can be appreciated better.
Lions, leopards and flower leopards are sometimes very afraid of people, and you can see more clearly with binoculars.
Hiking (also known as jungle walk, hiking trip, or hiking) is mainly a hike, usually taking several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, the first in 1964.
If you book flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay is announced, you may face a tricky situation.
The cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most of the cancellations due to the new crown virus have not been extended to July 2020 – the original Olympic timetable.
Ticket prices for most events are expected to range from $2,500 to $130,000, with a general ticket price of around $7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Even if there are no iron and ironing boards in the room, many hotels offer loan services.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like to wear ironed socks, you can try a blower (if you do).
Be careful not to let the clothes get too hot (this may lead to shrinkage, and in extreme cases it will burn the clothes).
There are many methods for clean water, some of which are more effective for specific pollution.
In some areas, boiling water is sufficient for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters have different effects. If you are concerned about this, you should consider purchasing sealed bottled water produced by a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter harmful animals that are not common in their hometown.
Insects can damage food, cause irritative reactions, in more serious cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison or infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can kill humans violently, are usually not among the pests.
Duty-free shopping means the opportunity to buy duty-free goods at a particular place.
Travellers to heavily taxed countries/regions can sometimes save a large amount of money, especially in those areas where products such as drinking water and tobacco are particularly cheap.
The most challenging driving conditions on the Beaufort–Pisbourg highway are the sections between Point Marion and Fairmont, which frequently pass through remote and remote areas.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, keep your head clear: there are steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns everywhere.
The speed limits advertised at the site are significantly lower than on previous and subsequent routes, with a common speed limit of 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and the importance of strictly complying with the speed limit requirements is greater than on other routes.
Surprisingly, however, the cell phone service here is much better than on many other routes along the way (such as the Pennsylvania Desert).
German cakes are very good, and Bavarian desserts are more varied and similar to their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit desserts are very common, apples can be used all year round to make desserts, and in summer you can eat cherry and apples.
Many German baked foods also feature almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and coffees are often perfect.
If you want to try a delicious little snack, try the jam bag, which has different names in different parts of the world, such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen, and Krapfen.
Curry is a vegetable and spices-based dish with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of water.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, curry often uses acid milk; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, so Indonesian cuisine is just one name, it covers a wide variety of local cuisines throughout the country.
However, if there are no additional adjectives, the word often refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is available everywhere in the islands, and there are many simple dishes that can be tasted, and the main flavorings Javanese like are peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various spices.
Horseshoes are mounted on both sides of the saddle to support the rider's feet.
They provide better stability for riders, but there are also safety risks, as riders' feet may get stuck.
If the rider is immediately thrown down, but there is a footprint on the horseshoe, the horse may drag him away while running. Prevention measures can be taken to minimize this risk.
First of all, most riders wear boots, which are light and narrow.
Secondly, some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety buckles, and if the rider pulls the saddle back, the belt will fall off the saddle.
Cochamó Valley, Chile's top mountaineering destination, is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite walls and cliffs.
There is a breathtaking view from the mountains, and climbers from all over the world are exploring new routes on the steep cliffs that can be used as reinforcement walls.
Alpine skiing, which includes regular skiing and snowboarding, is a very popular sport in which the skis or snowboards are fixed on your feet and slide down from the snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many skiers, who are sometimes referred to as "ski enthusiasts" and plan to ski at a particular location throughout the holiday.
The idea of skiing has been around for a long time - with cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5,000 BC!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Norwegians opened Australia's first leisure ski club in 1861.
Skiing free time: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, skiing tourism or skiing hiking.
This activity is associated with alpine skiing trips or mountaineering, but usually does not involve both activities. Both activities must take place on steep terrain and require harder skis and shoes.
Think of the skiing route as a similar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can go further than walking -- but only in very few cases can you get the same speed as skiing on a flat track without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area but many independent countries. Travelling across multiple countries usually means having to undergo multiple visa applications and passport checks.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area is a bit like a country.
As long as you reside in this area, you can usually cross the border directly without having to be checked at the passport checkpoint again.
By the same token, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply to each Schengen member state separately, thereby saving time, money, and formalities.
There is no uniform definition of which processed goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
There are regional differences in this definition, and the annual limits in North America and elsewhere may be shorter than in Europe.
Handcrafts may be defined as antiques, although the years of handcrafts are much shorter than those of the same kind produced in wholesale.
The rearing of deer is an important livelihood for Sami. The culture around the industry is also important for many people who live in other professions.
However, not all Sami people are involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, even in the traditional sense; they live by fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and usually use reindeer as a livestock.
Today, many Sami people are engaged in modern industries. Tourism is a major source of income in the Sami region.
Although the term "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romans, it is often considered an offense because it is associated with negative stereotypes and perceptions of Roma mistakes.
Your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected if the country you are visiting is constrained by a travel warning.
You can also consult other governments besides yours, but their proposals are made for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations from Europeans or Arabs.
Tourist warnings can only provide a brief summary of the local situation.
Compared to the more detailed information provided elsewhere, the suggestions here are often rather crude, generalized and too simple.
Bad weather is a general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon; such weather can cause damage, serious social unrest or casualties.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world. There are different types of bad weather, depending on geographical location, terrain and atmospheric conditions.
Hurricanes, hail, excessive rainfall, mountain fires, and thunderstorms, tornadoes, water tornadoes, and cyclones are all manifestations and effects of extreme weather.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include storms, snowstorms, snowstorms, icestorms and duststorms.
It is strongly recommended that travellers pay attention to the risks of bad weather in their location, which may affect their travel plans.
Any plan to go to a country that might be considered to be in a war zone should be subject to professional training.
Search the Internet for "Environmental Environment Courses" and you may find the address of the local company that provides the training.
This course usually covers all the issues discussed here and is often deepened in the light of real-world experiences.
Course training usually lasts 2–5 days and will involve role-playing, emergency response, and sometimes armed training.
Books and magazines on wildlife are common, but there are few publications on the survival of war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo metastatic surgery abroad are required to bring valid documents on their return.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports with no gender (X) indication or to change documents in order to meet the desired name and gender.
The degree of recognition of these documents by foreign governments also varies greatly.
In the era after 11 September 2001, searches at security checkpoints also became more disturbing.
Transplants who have not undergone surgery have to disclose their privacy through the scanner and cannot guarantee their dignity.
Offshore waves are waves that rapidly return from the beach to the sea, usually occurring in shallow reefs or similar places.
The terrain underwater causes the reflow to concentrate in some deeper areas, where it may form a rapid flow to deep water.
Most of the deaths were caused by upstream, physical drainage, and it is unlikely that swimming upstream will be successful.
After getting rid of the turbulence, it's not so difficult to swim back.
Strive to swim to a place where you won't be trapped again, or wait for rescue (depending on your skill and whether you've been found).
The impact of returning home is faster than the impact of culture (the honeymoon period is shorter), longer, and may be more severe.
For travelers who can easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes difficult to re-adapt to their native culture.
After living abroad for some time and returning home, you will find that you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your hometown culture habits.
When you're just leaving, people might be patient and forgiving because they know that travelers need to adapt to new countries.
People may not realize that travelers also need patience and understanding on their return journey.
For children, the acoustic performance of the pyramid is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them there silently before the show starts.
Usually you can hear the voices of tourists and stall vendors here. The sound and light are interwoven, like telling a moving story.
There is a lion face on the background screen, and it is also the narrator of a long story.
The scene is displayed on the pyramid, and different pyramids are lit.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819. Several states claimed sovereignty over the islands, and the islands have the largest number of bases, with 16 stations in operation by 2020.
The islands are located 120 kilometres north of the Antarctic Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a still active volcanic mouth was flooded and provided a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is located south of the peninsula, facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains merged into the plateau and re-formed the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains, which were divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of Antarctica, known as the Sentinal Ridge, the highest mountain range is the Munson Mountains, with a peak of 4892 metres.
In remote areas where cell phone signals are not covered, satellite phones may be your only option.
In general, satellite phones cannot replace mobile phones because they can only make calls outdoors where satellite signals are readily available.
The service is often used for navigation, including yachts and remote data and voice exploration.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide details about connecting to this service.
For those who plan to spend an empty year, excursions are becoming an increasingly popular option.
This is especially popular with secondary school graduates, who can take a year off before going to university without affecting their education.
In many cases, taking part in inter-year courses abroad can substantially enhance your chances of returning to higher education.
As a rule, tuition is required to participate in these educational projects.
Finland is an excellent sailing sailing saint, with the reputation of a "country of thousands of lakes" and thousands of islands within its lakes and coastal islands.
In islands and lakes, boats are not necessary.
The coastal islands and some of the largest lakes are large enough to accommodate any yacht, but smaller boats and even boats can bring different experiences.
Boating is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat per 78 people.
Similar situations exist in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but they are unique in other respects (for example, in the Netherlands, the figure is one in forty).
Most typical Baltic cruises stay longer in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can have a full day to visit the historic city for several days and then go back to sleep on the boat at night.
There is no need for a separate visa (as of 2009) if only a boat visits the shore.
Some of the ferries featured Berlin as a highlight in the brochure. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and the boat prices do not include the cost of visiting the city.
For people of all ages and backgrounds, air travel can be a terrifying experience, especially if you have never been on an airplane before or have had a painful experience.
This is not a disgraceful thing: it's nothing like many people's fears and dislikes of other things.
For some people, understanding the working principles and procedures of the aircraft may be helpful if they want to overcome fears caused by unknown things or uncontrollable situations.
Express companies can be rewarded for delivering goods quickly. Oftentimes, time is very important for business documents, goods or parts for emergency maintenance.
On some routes, large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and small companies, there are problems.
If they transport goods by air, it may take a few days on some routes to unload and cross.
The quickest way is to carry it as a pick-up baggage. According to airlines regulations, it is forbidden to carry unboarded passengers' luggage, and you need to be on the scene at that time.
The most obvious way to get into a first class or business class is to spend a large amount of money to enjoy this privilege (or, better yet, let your company pay you to get in).
